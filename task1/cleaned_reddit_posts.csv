depression,I don't get how other people aren't suicidal,I'm in therapy  I'm taking medications and I still think almost daily about suicide.

depression,"My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. My family is saying I will ""ruin Christmas"" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do?","A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support  she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened  it left me deeply depressed  particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate  I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them  but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. 

I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone  I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother  even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However  their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any ""normal"" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice  I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down  or even by coming down just for dinner  that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments  implying I would be at fault for them. 

Here's the breakdown:  with my family  I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However  I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family  while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact  they've dismissed it as me ""not having enough social activity""  as ""not having enough will""  and have called my therapy ""a waste of time."" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do  I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's  but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition. 

Any and all thoughts are welcome.

They don't want to hear about how you're severely depressed and think about killing yourself every day. It makes them uncomfortable.

depression,I am a 17 year old student in korea and I am stressed overwhelmingly by academics and the SAT. Please read my story and tell my story to others. I am going to jump next week. Goodbye.,I just finished writing my final goodbye letters to my mom  dad  and brother. Goodbye. I want to talk to someone but I don’t know who. I’m planning on overdosing on lean or some other drug. I know that my parents will just say that depression and suicidal thoughts are just common and focus on my grade and GPA. I feel hopeless. I want to know where to take my  life from. No comfort or support will help me much. I feel like I’m better off gone than having to work more and study and prepare for school and the SAT. To me that is all there is to life. I’m sorry mom and dad. Even though I spent time with you I simply can’t get over it. Goodbye and I love you because this is not your fault. Thank you for all the memories and support you have me for the past seventeen years of my life. The times when you scolded me that if I didn’t get a good SAT score  then I would be sent to academies and my dog would be sent back to its previous home. These days believe it or not  I’ve been doing some things that a regular high schooler should not do like sipping lean  vaping  and taking sleeping pills to sleep at night from the nightmares.

depression,my pain (25F) is overwhelming: i've been quarantining in an abusive household for the last year and am in need of some kind words,"i've been struggling a lot this week. my mental health has always been shit but lately  it's just gotten worse. i recently fired my therapist because my insurance changed and she wasn't accepting the new provider (she wasn't a good fit for me either  but something is better than nothing). so aside from my boyfriend and a few friends  i don't have anyone i can rely on. i feel bad venting to the people around me because they're all going through tough times too and it just doesn't feel fair for me to unload on them. so i hope that opening up to this sub is the right idea  even though i still feel guilty expressing my pain.

the heart of it all is that i have C-PTSD (along with other psych disorders) and these past few weeks I've been drifting in and out of disassociation  flashbacks  and episodes of crying fits. i can't stop reliving my trauma and am having a tough time with positive self-talk. right now i'd say my self-worth and self-esteem are at a 0. it doesn't help that i live in an abusive household but unfortunately i don't have anywhere else to go  and this is something I've dealt with my whole life. my mother is neglectful and my father is emotionally  verbally  and sometimes physically abusive. he picked a fight with me this morning for no reason and it set me over the edge. so between the flashbacks  disassociation  and deeply painful depression  i just feel so unsafe in my house. if my parents see me crying  they'll either gaslight or bully me. i just wish things were different. i don't really know where i'm going with this post other than it would be nice to be reminded that not everyone is mean and nasty. that i am a good person and i deserve a good life. i just want to stop crying.

depression,Why do I always feel suicidal when I feel overwhelmed or triggered?,"I'm not usually depressed but I always feel suicidal and want to kill myself when something even slightly distressing happens or if I get overwhelmed/triggered.
It's something that's been happening to me since I was little. I remember wanting to kill myself and even preparing to do it when I was caught skipping school when I was 13. I was ready to do it. Only reason I didn't get to go ahead with it was because I was seen walking on the streets by someone I knew and they took me home. 

Fast forward to today. My mental state was quite stable and i was okay until I had a triggering conversation with my dad where he called me stupid and that set me off. Now I'm consumed by suicidal thoughts just from that one conversation. I know it will pass eventually but this seems to be quite a common reaction for my mind to have after an upsetting event. 

I can't for the life of me understand why this keeps happening",87,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1hejozy/why_do_i_always_feel_suicidal_when_i_feel/,always feel suicidal feel overwhelmed triggered,im usually depressed always feel suicidal want kill something even slightly distressing happens get overwhelmedtriggered something thats happening since little remember wanting kill even preparing caught skipping school 13 ready reason didnt get go ahead seen walking street someone knew took home fast forward today mental state quite stable okay triggering conversation dad called stupid set im consumed suicidal thought one conversation know pas eventually seems quite common reaction mind upsetting event cant life understand keep happening
depression,i have a carpet beetle infestation and i'm so fucking overwhelmed.,"the past 5 years i've been practically bed-ridden due to my depression. i live  eat and sleep in my bedroom. those 4 walls are the only place in the world i feel safe and secure. and now literally every piece of clothing and bedding is covered in beetle larvae.

i'm just so overwhelmed. i'm sleeping on the couch now  and i feel so damn exposed. and i've barely managed to go through a fraction of my clothes today. for the past few months i've been struggling to find the motivation to fucking shower  how the fuck am i supposed to go through all of my possessions one by one  clean my depression room and then somehow find the strength to let strangers into my safe space?

depression,Sister is depressed - love addiction - should she go inpatient? Please help ,"My sister has been depressed pretty much for a year. She was prescribed Zoloft. I’m not confident that the meds are working for her.

This weird thing has happened where it’s like she’s addicted to love. Her feelings of hopelessness are that she’s going to spend her life alone so she’s constantly searching for male connection. It’s like a form of OCD for her. 

She’s also gained a considerable amount of weight and she lost her job.  She is highly educated and accomplished.

She has been saying that she wishes she would go to sleep and not wake up. Earlier this year if she had suicidal ideation. 

Everyday my parents worry about her and call me. I don’t know what to do. It’s like she’s stuck in her mind and she doesn’t focus on her mental wellness at all. I’m lost. 

My family is not sure what to do here. If she were to go inpatient  how do we start by understanding what that even means? What are some good inpatient centers and what is the difference between an inpatient center  a wellness center  and a psychiatric ward?

I need to feel this boost because sometimes especially late at night I feel very sad  angry and full of anticipation anxiety.
I try to listen to music to improve my mood but it doesn’t always work. 
All of this because I think I have a mild depression. 
However I’m always left with the sensation of doing it again the next day and the day after.
I try to not exceed the 3 day mark but it’s hard.

I'm so scared. it's so overwhelming and we don't know how to deal with it. on top of that my boyfriend and I have major issues and fight A LOT to the point where it gets physical. we are so toxic but still love each other to death. and hate each other to death. he just wants sex all the time to feel close to me and wanted and to get rid of frustration (that's all that helps him) but I'm too depressed and down most of the time to even want to talk nevermind have sex... so I get put in this fucked up situation where I end up having sex with him regardless of how I feel - and then end up feeling worse - just for him to fight with me about something else a few minutes after..... i don't know what to do anymore or even where to look... im sure being dead would be easier than this  but I would feel to bad leaving my family who loves me behind  incase they blame themselves or think they did something wrong when  raising me which is not the case - they are and have been perfect.

depression,Guys I need HELP. Addicted to sadness?,"Please help. I have sought many psychotherapists  been on depression meds  mixtures  combos. DOne counselling  therapy  psychiatrist visits  medical trials. affirmations  rebirthing ( helped the most). 

Please read carefully. I do need help  I want some great insight or a word or a line to shake me out of this. 

I am constantly depressed and seem to have a ""go-to"" of misery and fear and sadness. It's almost like a comfort zone. Yet it is soo uncomfortable. It is not comforting at all. It is so exhausting  so brought and bitter and angry. I just feel angry. 

I say affirmations and I MEAN them. I do not victimize myself. No-one but me is the creator of my thoughts and I know this. It's nobody else doing ""bad"" things  or ""his/her fault"". It's me and I'm not a victim. 

It's as if I am afraid to be happy. I wrote ""Dare to be Happy"" on my mantras list  and it's usually the one that sets me off crying. I've been crying for 18 months now. I've had periods of huge black depression. Which is situation depression. 

I am not a depressive type. THis mood I think  is due to being unemployed. 

But the thing is  I am PERFECTLY qualified for the job I know I'm good at. I know I'm good at it. I'm truly not delusional. I'm talented enough  good enough and likeable and humble and helpful to the team enough. 

The times I've had that job  I'm super happy  and people love me. I like people and they like me. 

Yet each time  when the job is a contract ( my work always is)  I have this inside feeling that  once the contract is over  I'll have to hide and get under the blankets and escape the black cloud on the horizon. It's a weird feeling that I've talked to  and addressed and see the silliness of. = ""THat's silly now  you end the contract  have a few days off  the sun is shining  take a break  have some friends around  then you'll get another job!"".

And I truly KNOW this and mean it  and here I am. Unemplooyed  again  and I had a contract job for 2 months   then another one before that 5 years ago for 8 months. Etc. Each time  I LOVE the job  I wish it to continue  maybe they'll ask me to stay! Maybe it'll get extended. Etc.



Other people IN THIS TOWN  have a house  a car  a job - the job I wish for  and friends to fill the in between. They understand that sometimes in between contracts you have a week or two off. THey go visit friends  they have a hobby  etc. They're OK. 

It's as if I'm secretly afraid to just be happy  and this has led me to being constantly unemployed in a place where there is SO MUCH WORK  and I'm genuinely applying for 2-3 jobs a week. These applications get a ""no"" response. I don't expect all of the Yes's  of course. 

But my point is - I believe my inner voice is saying ""Don't be happy  it's not safe to be happy  what if you get that most amazing thing and then it'll get taken away and you'll die"". 

I now this is STUPID. I know childhood trauma can set a pattern. I do step work  talk myself out of things  give myself rationalizing on each of these ""monster in the cupboard"" type thoughts. I do believe it comes from a terrible and utterly shocking childhood trauma  which I won't go into. But I have addressed this each and every time. I understand the initial childhood shock that could lead me to be permanently stuck in this repurcussion. And I've done so much work on that part   in case THIS is the reason why. 

I am ALIVE  I am HAPY  I deserve to be HAPPY  just for today. ANd tonight. I can be happy tomorrow  that's great too!



But nothing shifts it. Even when I sing these affirmations and dance to them. Nothing so far. To make me into a normal grown up person-with-a-normal-job. A person with a house and a car. I am just so fucking sad. 

I believe this filter in me  is making the entire life I am experiencing and i just want so so much  to have a happy filter that sticks. Because right now  I shout  sing  scream  and push myself  laugh myself into a a happy zone  and as soon as I fall aslepp that day  it shifts into misery and sadness again. 

  
Please please help. I am so sad and I want to hear a line  or a word  or have something SHOCK me into having a change of perspective. I deserve the whole life of good things that I see in my vision and feel in my heart. I deserve and am worth ALL the good. 

SO why am I sitting her screaming into a pillow?

  
The job isn't that hard to get. Without this work that I enjoy  I have no life. 

I enjoy life. I like being happy.

depression,Not suicidal but I wouldn’t mind not waking up tomorrow,I’m not suicidal. I have a good life  by the standards of what a good life is I suppose. Good family  good friends  good country  good future ahead of me. It makes me feel worse about the feelings I’ve been having lately. I’ve been thinking about death  about the many  many more years I might continue living and growing on this planet  the good and the bad I will experience and wonder if any of it’s actually worth it. I look at the world and the more I do so the more it all becomes so intensely insane and draining to me. I mean what is any of this anyway? What am I? I’ve tried finding meaning through various philosophical perspectives but ultimately cant find an acceptable solution to this maddening reality  it’s all just anyone’s best guess as to what it’s all about. Most nights I consider the possibility that I might not wake up the next morning  and a strange feeling of comfort comes over me  I think I would welcome death in a way like that.

depression,"My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. My family is saying I will ""ruin Christmas"" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do?","A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support  she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened  it left me deeply depressed  particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate  I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them  but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. 

I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone  I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother  even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However  their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any ""normal"" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice  I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down  or even by coming down just for dinner  that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments  implying I would be at fault for them. 

Here's the breakdown:  with my family  I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However  I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family  while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact  they've dismissed it as me ""not having enough social activity""  as ""not having enough will""  and have called my therapy ""a waste of time."" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do  I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's  but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition. 

Any and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you.",2383,376,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eczhm3/my_friend_attempted_suicide_a_couple_days_ago_my/,friend attempted suicide couple day ago family saying ruin christmas spend time hospital christmas eve instead visiting,good friend mine ive attending therapy bpd overdosed couple day ago survived transported unconscious hospital woke unsurprisingly devastated want support boyfriend family member care friend plan see family christmas happened left deeply depressed particularly another good friend mine committed suicide four year ago almost day elaborate dont like spending christmas family like christmas always chore preparation quiet peace thought would spend christmas visiting friend hospital dont want alone know situation would appreciate someone came visit proposed mother brother even possibility would spend afternoon go see dinner however comment left gasping air showed little empathy friend mother asked normal friend brother told ultimately choice would ruining christmas coming even coming dinner everyone would disappointed would create argument implying would fault here breakdown family risk ostracized week month dont go however ive felt like less less family ive felt like friend shown compassion empathy depression bpd family ever fact theyve dismissed enough social activity enough called therapy waste time feel like visiting friend right thing know think whole time would family want ostrasized month dont think could handle mental condition thought welcome thank

depression,I’m ready to kill myself I can’t take this anymore,"
25F

I am so sick of this life. Like literal life. I am a Christian so I believe in God and positive thinking but I'm literally giving all this shit up. 

I wanted to kill myself at 18 but somehow ended up at college. I graduated in 2020 so that tells you everything you need to know. I didn’t think I would make it past 18 so being here now is like what the fuck.

God isn't doing anything in my life. My positive thoughts aren't materializing. I don't even feel connection to the shit I believe in and am wishing for. My mind is literally turned off. I made muliple vision boards  read affirmations everyday  and do all the shit you're suppose to do. I can't do it anymore. 

I've been praying for a job that I can start and get into and that will pay me all the money I need and more. I've been battling unemployment and under paying jobs for damn a year and some change. I am beyond that. 

I am suppose to be a rich ass artist and had to take jobs at a gym wearing business casual making $15 an hour. $500 A WEEK. I FUCKING HATE IT. Haven't had a job all year. My heat is off now because I'm literally not making any money. 

I HATE GOD AND ALL OF THIS POSITIVE THINKING SHIT  BECAUSE WHY IS IT NOT WORKING. 

WHAT THE HELL.

I'm late on my rent this month  my parents have been supporting me but I'm tired of it. I want my own money. I want a life I love. I hate where I live even though it was my dream at one point. I might have to move back into my parents tiny disgusting home. I HATE THIS SHIT. I'm behind on so many bills. 

I got a call for a job making $17-$19 but I had to pay $140 for a background check and license in a field that is not the one I set out to pursue. I DON'T HAVE $140 TO GIVE TO A JOB BEFORE I START WORKING IT. On top of that  it could take up to a month to get the license. So I'm out $140 and have to wait a month to even start working. BULLSHIT

I literally don't know what to do. What's the point of all that believing and shit if it don't work. I apply to so many jobs every day. I even made multiple resumes and shit. I literally don't know what to do.

I need money RIGHT NOW and a whole lot of it. Money that's sustainable so I can actually live and enjoy my life  go on vacations and shit. I grew up lower middle class and I hate that's it's following me in my adult life. 

I HAVE NO MORE TIME TO WAIT ON ALL THE POSITIVE SHIT I WANT. I NEED IT TODAY. 

I would rather kill myself then go through all these downs. I've been more down than up and I'm sick of this shit. FUCK THE WORLD. I RATHER NOT BE ON IT IF IT'S GOING TO BE THIS DEPRESSING. 

I've only had one dream my whole life  be a wealthy and succesful tv and film writer  director  and producer. My whole life I've never dreamed of anything else. I started my career as a production assistant and don't even know what else to do with my life after that. I got out that role because iI hated the politics and dynamics of it and was getting severly underpaid  and since I'm a PA  nobody gives a fuck. 

I've had one dream and one dream only. I don't even know what to do with my life. Even if I did move back in  I would just lay down and mope. I feel dead inside. I hate life. I'd rather it be over than feel this way.",320,129,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1antxdq/im_ready_to_kill_myself_i_cant_take_this_anymore/,im ready kill cant take anymore,25f sick life like literal life christian believe god positive thinking im literally giving shit wanted kill 18 somehow ended college graduated 2020 tell everything need know didnt think would make past 18 like fuck god isnt anything life positive thought arent materializing dont even feel connection shit believe wishing mind literally turned made muliple vision board read affirmation everyday shit youre suppose cant anymore ive praying job start get pay money need ive battling unemployment paying job damn year change beyond suppose rich as artist take job gym wearing business casual making 15 hour 500 week fucking hate havent job year heat im literally making money hate god positive thinking shit working hell im late rent month parent supporting im tired want money want life love hate live even though dream one point might move back parent tiny disgusting home hate shit im behind many bill got call job making 1719 pay 140 background check license field one set pursue dont 140 give job start working top could take month get license im 140 wait month even start working bullshit literally dont know whats point believing shit dont work apply many job every day even made multiple resume shit literally dont know need money right whole lot money thats sustainable actually live enjoy life go vacation shit grew lower middle class hate thats following adult life time wait positive shit want need today would rather kill go down ive im sick shit fuck world rather going depressing ive one dream whole life wealthy succesful tv film writer director producer whole life ive never dreamed anything else started career production assistant dont even know else life got role ii hated politics dynamic getting severly underpaid since im pa nobody give fuck ive one dream one dream dont even know life even move back would lay mope feel dead inside hate life id rather feel way

However it seemed like she had been drinking heavily during the argument and when I texted her again she wasn't spelling anything correctly   I pretty much couldnt make out anything she was saying   but i was able to make out the words ""arm"" and ""ambulance"" so i called her immediately. she was crying out loud begging me to go see her saying she couldnt move or breathe and that she was bleeding. she lives a 1hr walk away from me so i was panicking because it would take me too long to get to her house and it was late at night. i hung up on her to tell her friend what was going on but when i called back again after like 2min her phone was off. 



after this i just immediately left the house to go see her. i couldnt call an ambulance because i didnt know what her exact home address was  she lives in a huge neighborhood with lots of houses that look the same and we've always went there together so i got lost for a bit trying to find it myself   my plan was to call an ambulance once i found her house but when i got there there were cops and they told me they had already taken her to the hospital and that she was alright. i wasnt in my right mind so i didnt even ask which hospital and refused to answer any question the cops asked  once i heard she was ok i left to go back home before it could get way too late. 



the next day it fucking hit me that i have no idea where she is   i have no idea who called the ambulance bc it wasnt me or the only other person who knew   her phone is still dead   she doesnt talk much to her family members so i dont have their numbers and i have no one to ask about her but thankfully a woman from the hospital she was in contacted me to tell me they were sending her to what is basically a mental asylum. i live in an extremely shitty country so the room they had put her in was a fucked up small room with just a bed in it  nothing else. it broke my heart to see her alone and scared in that hellhole covered in dried blood stains and lots of bandages wrapped around her arm. she's basically imprisoned  she's being treated in such an inhumane way that i dont even want to talk about and they said they would keep her in there for a while. 



i cant wrap my head around the fact that if i had never said those words this would've never happened. i cant believe that i could've lost the person i love the most over the fact i chose to be a mean bitch despite knowing how much her entire mental state depends on me and how scared she is of losing me. she tried to end her own life because she thought i was going to leave her. i have no idea how im supposed to live with this guilt   this has probably been the worst 24 hours of my life and i cant believe everything was normal just a day ago and now she's gonna lose her job and be treated like a psycho for the rest of her life just because of this. im in so much pain that i dont even have the words to describe it bc ive never been in this situation before. tomorrow i have to get in her house to get her phone and clothes and i dont know how ill react when i see her blood on the floor. i dont know how to deal with this and i have no one to rely on  please help me.",51,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1j614cs/my_words_drove_my_girlfriend_to_a_suicide_attempt/,word drove girlfriend suicide attempt,20f argument 21f gf yesterday ended saying mean thing anger told sick basically implied would leave realized done went apologize 20minutes said thing however seemed like drinking heavily argument texted wasnt spelling anything correctly pretty much couldnt make anything saying able make word arm ambulance called immediately cry loud begging go see saying couldnt move breathe bleeding life 1hr walk away panicking would take long get house late night hung tell friend going called back like 2min phone immediately left house go see couldnt call ambulance didnt know exact home address life huge neighborhood lot house look weve always went together got lost bit trying find plan call ambulance found house got cop told already taken hospital alright wasnt right mind didnt even ask hospital refused answer question cop asked heard ok left go back home could get way late next day fucking hit idea idea called ambulance bc wasnt person knew phone still dead doesnt talk much family member dont number one ask thankfully woman hospital contacted tell sending basically mental asylum live extremely shitty country room put fucked small room bed nothing else broke heart see alone scared hellhole covered dried blood stain lot bandage wrapped around arm shes basically imprisoned shes treated inhumane way dont even want talk said would keep cant wrap head around fact never said word wouldve never happened cant believe couldve lost person love fact chose mean bitch despite knowing much entire mental state depends scared losing tried end life thought going leave idea im supposed live guilt probably worst 24 hour life cant believe everything normal day ago shes gon na lose job treated like psycho rest life im much pain dont even word describe bc ive never situation tomorrow get house get phone clothes dont know ill react see blood floor dont know deal one rely please help

mentalhealth,Overwhelming emotion. I'm new. I don't need this to explode.,"I have an increasingly serious... THING that's been developing since my early 20's. I hear or see things and they fill me with the emotion I believe they were intending  but it's too much.
LORE: I'm a 27yo M. I've been diagnosed with OCD  but with a caveat I don't remember or know if relevant. Im afraid to go see a doctor and i dont know why. Ive taken autism tests and have come back ""definitely on the spectrum"" despite me not ""feeling"" ""un-normal"" (I'm not trying to degrade mental illness and say it's 'lesser than'. I'm just scared and trying to put it in as plain of English as I can)
SCENARIO: Things have been affecting me too much more  by my standards  recently. For this I'll give a couple examples. I'm a fan of Sleater-Kinney  and a few days ago I listened to their song ""Little babies"" again for the first time in couple years. It sent me on an existential crisis of second wave feminism and the controversial and dichotomy ""role of 'the mother'"" I was constantly on the verge of tears and I don't know why. I cry  I feel  often enough  but some many things are pushing me towards that extreme of emotion regularly. The  other example is; I delivered something to a Walmart that was an employee appreciation BBQ out back near the delivery area. They had a company doing it and a bunch of Walmart employees were out there  getting their food. I asked an older ladies (maybe in her late 50's  early 60's) what was going on and they said ""it's because our accident calendar went past 100 days."" That's nothing! I should have just said ""Cool!"" Which I did. But I was overcome with a sense of dread. The same feeling I got after my 2nd and last trip of any hallucinogenic  where I'm sad and way to overly empathetic for this older person that I don't know  or know her circumstance  but I'm scribing a ""wasted life"" onto her for no reason  and it fills me with so much emotion that I need to disassociate  lest risk a panic attack. 
Am I just an asshole? Is this just was ""normal"" people go through and I'm just realizing it for the first time. It's ok if it is  I'm always trying to be a better person  but I'm so confused and scared.

Thanks to any person that replies to this. Know that it's only a little crisis and your word won't completely dictate my future actions.

I don’t know if I’m failing as a husband. I’m the provider in my household—I take care of all the financial responsibilities  I help my mother-in-law  and I support my wife. I work hard to make sure they have everything they need.

But my father-in-law passed away in December  and my mother-in-law’s health has been declining ever since. We even moved to a new city just to be closer to her.

Today  my wife had an emotional breakdown  and I feel guilty. I feel like I should be able to support her more  but no matter what I do  it never seems enough. At the same time  I feel like I’m drowning in work. I feel stuck  like I’m not growing as a person  and I don’t even know what I should do or feel at this point.

I’m angry  sad  and alone. I don’t have any friends here either  so I have no one to talk to. I feel like I should just deal with it on my own  but I also know I’m reaching my limit.

At my job  I have access to a psychologist  but only one person can see them.

My husband has known and I have been very straightforward about my mental health from the beginning of our relationship. He is the kindest man and handles it very well as far as I could tell  but after living together for almost a year I can tell it’s wearing him down. He started to see a therapist on his own  and keeps trying to reassure me that it’s not my fault  even though he only started seeking therapy after I had a particularly bad breakdown two weeks ago. It’s gotten to the point where he is afraid to go on deployment leaving me home alone for 6-9 months. I try to reassure him that I’ll be okay but he’s convinced that it wouldn’t be safe. I’m tired of bleeding my problems out all over him  he always tells me that that’s what he’s here for  and he loves me all the same. Now that it’s becoming painfully obvious that my mental health is affecting him I’m not sure what to do. Should I start masking and keeping my feelings from him to protect him?

mentalhealth,How do I keep the voices from overwhelming her?,"This is all new to me and my gf  it's been about 2 months. 2 horrible  sad  terrifying  hopless months with the voices. Recently my gf found out she has bipolar II and that it's what's causing her to auditory hallucinations. For the most part she's able to keep the voice to the back of her mind during the day  but at night  night is when it can get down right scary for her. 95% of the time the voices take on the sound of the parents. The voices could sound muffled like it's happening from the other room  other times the voices are moving in all directions circling her like pray  and in bad times they are screaming (the volume amplifies when she tries to ignore them with head phones.). 

Most nights she's in the fetal position shaking even if and when she does fall asleep her body will still be shaking. I'm seeing this all unfold before me every day and every night  there's nothing worse then seeing the person u love most going through such agony that she wishes for death  and m knowing there's nothing I can do to take it way. I do the best I can I really do. I'm trying to learn what I can about bipolar  I listen to her  reasure her that what she is hearing isn't happening  I hold her till she stops crying  I try to make her smile  keep her distracted  I wake up at the drop of the hate if she needs anything  when I can tell she's having nightmares I kiss her and whisper it's okay I'm here. I don't sleep that well anymore cause I'm waking up cause I hear her crying or she wakes me up cause she's scared.

 Majority of the time she doesn't want me to sleep she feels better hearing that I'm awake playing fortnite lol. Luckily I'm not going about this all alone  her wonderful cat Cheeto a literal angel and one of the best souls on this planet has been helping me and sometimes it's a tag team effort. When I'm not home for whatever reason he handles her very well sometimes with better success than me at times. When she's dissociating and just completely gone from her body he will walk up to her reach out and tap her on the shoulder  press his head into her arm. When she's in bed he will lay on her chest and apply pressure  if she's hitting herself he's comes and gets her to pet him instead. 

He was never taught this behavior but just new instinctually that she needed him. Sometimes when it's at its worst I'm holding her and cheetoes rubbing up on her and/or sitting on her she will eventually feel safe and calm down. I seriously fear the day he dies  It will completely destroy her and I feel I might lose her. She's seeing Drs but she's trying to find others cause they are not a good fit  the medication she's been trying isn't working they don't listen or try other medication. She often says she feels she running out of time and I'm just fucking scared for her  I just want her happy and to have whatever normalcy she can possibly have.

mentalhealth,Mental paralysis/overwhelm from too many interests - what to do?,"Hey all. This post is mental health related from the standpoint of stress/anxiety/overwhelm and impulsivity. I have bipolar and cPTSD  also diagnosed w GAD. I have a lot of different interests and want to pursue them all.

Or I will start many many things and will not fully follow through with any of them. In the process of starting those many many things I will sometimes spend a LOT of money on them bc I’m feeling so inspired…And then I get distracted by another interest and don’t actually use what I bought for the previous interest etc. And then I feel really badly about myself and ashamed.

I don’t really know how to manage this behavior. I really do want to pursue all of my interests and I know that it is not possible… but how do I keep my focus and actually finish what I start?

You hear about the people that work normal/long hours and you hear about the people that don't work  but I'm that in-between where I try to work between 3-5 hours a day 5 days a week. I run my own business so can schedule my own clients and I know I could take on more and earn more and have tried it but when I do  my mental health takes an absolute battering. If I have more than 3 client sessions a day (they all last an hour each)  I start to feel panicked. Waking up to more than 3 and I'm filled with dread.

I earn enough  more than enough so this isn't a financial worry of mine  but in this society  I FEEL like I should be doing more.

I'll tell clients I'm fully booked which I am for my current schedule  but I know I COULD take them on. When I do or have in the past  I become quite depressed  irritable and hate my job and I come close to quitting. The current working hours already feel overwhelming for me but it's bearable. I should note I like my job but it's an emotionally draining job and I can be outside in all weathers for most of these hours. I also have admin and stuff to do on top of all this and I built the business from scratch so I'm immensely proud that I am financially able to cater to my own brain  but I don't know why my brain is the way it is.

mentalhealth,Phone addiction it's been really killing me and i need help...,"( |TW:depression| I know for these kinds of things you would hire a psychiatrist or something  but sadly that isn't an option for me for reasons i cannot really share.I just want to find alike experienced people and what was their way out.)

Phone addiction it's been really killing me for EXTREMELY long time  and i feel like i mentally just can't keep up with myself and neither with this.It started when i was young and it developed as more time passed throughout my life and since i was pretty lonely kid my phone it's been the only thing that was there to keep me company and as someone might guess that slowly grew into addiction which just turned into depression.And now im stuck in a life i don't want for myself that i cannot just leave because it grew too much into my being and core and besides that it's the only thing i have really.

Now yeah i know that most people would currently suggest just blocking all apps and use phone for what phones are usually meant to and maybe do some hobby i always wanted or get some work done.But the thing is i really don't have anything outside of it no friends whom i can hang out with no hobbies besides writing my mind out on a pice of paper and certainty no sports where i do something.Yes my whole day just revolves around laying around besides when i have to go to school but i never wanted that and on several occasions i've tried to change but i just can't.I watched every motivational video and ones about how to leave the phone read everything online yet my mind just refuses to do what i want it to do and i truly feel hopeless.

Funny thing about this is that i want to become a video editor but i easily just drift out on tik tok meanwhile trying to find content and inspiration as well as material to work with and my phone addiction with that hobby clearly doesn't align at all which is just cherry on top.If anyone had this problem i would like to hear what you did against all odds that im currently facing and i would be so grateful if it works because my attention span along with rot i received with this stupid device is just too strong for me tho i am willing to cooperate.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1j8dfw3/phone_addiction_its_been_really_killing_me_and_i/,phone addiction really killing need help,twdepression know kind thing would hire psychiatrist something sadly isnt option reason really sharei want find alike experienced people way phone addiction really killing extremely long time feel like mentally cant keep neither thisit started young developed time passed throughout life since pretty lonely kid phone thing keep company someone might guess slowly grew addiction turned depressionand im stuck life dont want leave grew much core besides thing really yeah know people would currently suggest blocking apps use phone phone usually meant maybe hobby always wanted get work donebut thing really dont anything outside friend hang hobby besides writing mind pice paper certainty sport somethingyes whole day revolves around laying around besides go school never wanted several occasion ive tried change canti watched every motivational video one leave phone read everything online yet mind refuse want truly feel hopeless funny thing want become video editor easily drift tik tok meanwhile trying find content inspiration well material work phone addiction hobby clearly doesnt align cherry topif anyone problem would like hear odds im currently facing would grateful work attention span along rot received stupid device strong tho willing cooperate
mentalhealth,Help me understand my addiction.,"Hey there I don't think my issues that big but I still think that I should get some advice. 
I recently turned 16 and for the last 2 months the best time of the day was the time at which I went to sleep because before sleeping I used to think of imaginary scenarios which should play out in my head in the half sleepy state and it would give me immense joy and then I would dose of to sleep. Initially it happened randomly but then it's started happening regularly because I really wanted it to happen and the scenarios are nothing nsfw and are mostly in my control. 
But now I am starting to face problems in achieving this so I started to check what was my situation and did some research about it and found out that if I relax myself and listen to some static in a dark place I'll get the scenarios playing. But then I stumbled upon a post which were about hallucinations  and upon some research i realised  that I was indeed hallucinating. And as a fact I know that hallucinations are bad and I don't want any mental illness. But I can't resist without these. And also it's hard for me to sleep without the scenarios...",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1isgqi2/help_me_understand_my_addiction/,help understand addiction,hey dont think issue big still think get advice recently turned 16 last 2 month best time day time went sleep sleeping used think imaginary scenario play head half sleepy state would give immense joy would dose sleep initially happened randomly started happening regularly really wanted happen scenario nothing nsfw mostly control starting face problem achieving started check situation research found relax listen static dark place ill get scenario playing stumbled upon post hallucination upon research realised indeed hallucinating fact know hallucination bad dont want mental illness cant resist without also hard sleep without scenario

mentalhealth,I helped my drug-addicted friend turn his life around and be much happier,"The last few years have been super tough for my childhood bestfriend. His dad left early in his life and it affected him badly. He turned to drugs and got in with the wrong crowd  which left him in a really tough place. He randomly messaged me after around 8 years of no contact.

I've had my challenges too  but he reached out to ask me if I could help him and give him some advice on 'how to be happy again'.

I told him getting help for his drug addiction was the first step  but he said he already had that arranged. Then he asked me to just give him as many tips as I could think of that have made me happy. What decisions have I made to help me live a fairly happy life (most days).

I struggled with this at first  but then I decided to treat it like making a Youtube video (the think I like doing most) which made is a lot easier.

[You can check the video out here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p0X0lfnWHM) if you want  but here is the list below which may be easier.

1. Declutter  clean and systemise your personal space
2. Use an online diary to free up your mind and memory
3. Take more risks as happiness is often on the other side of risk
4. Try and do work that you love
5. Give yourself the grace to fail and fall forward
6. Wear stupid clothing to train yourself to not care what people think
7. Simplify making better decisions. And harder to make bad decisions.
8. Only buy things that bring you joy.
9. Make time to love yourself and treat yourself like someone you care about.

mentalhealth,WE ARE IN A OPIOID CRISIS the day that we start treating addiction like the mental disorder is will be the day millions of people will get help in their battle,First of all if you’ve never been addicted to opioids you could never understand. After a certain amount of time it changes your brain chemistry and you no longer think the same. Your brain significantly loses dopamine and serotonin adding even more so to the mental disorder . Would you say “just be normal” to a person with autism? Then don’t say “just stop using” to an addicted person. It is a disorder a physical and mental disorder. Unless you’ve ever experienced it you will never understand just like I would never understand what it’s like to have autism! Most people in the US have used opioids whether it was prescribed from a doctor for a c section or for dental reasons. After using opioids for a certain period of time your body and brain WILL become reliant on it and you will have a new addiction disorder especially in the majority cases where people where prescribed it by doctors and that is guaranteed!   So just like you would never shame an autistic person for having a mental disorder bc you would never understand don’t shame an addicted person they have a mental disorder too!,6,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ufv62z/we_are_in_a_opioid_crisis_the_day_that_we_start/,opioid crisis day start treating addiction like mental disorder day million people get help battle,first youve never addicted opioids could never understand certain amount time change brain chemistry longer think brain significantly loses dopamine serotonin adding even mental disorder would say normal person autism dont say stop using addicted person disorder physical mental disorder unless youve ever experienced never understand like would never understand like autism people u used opioids whether prescribed doctor c section dental reason using opioids certain period time body brain become reliant new addiction disorder especially majority case people prescribed doctor guaranteed like would never shame autistic person mental disorder bc would never understand dont shame addicted person mental disorder

mentalhealth,Helping addiction process,"Put this in a comment  though it is useful for others to see! 

First off  nothings wrong with you. Let’s get that out of the way.

Big issue today  however most “treatments” don’t work as well as we would like.

To break addictions you have to know how the brain works. It seeks out more and more of what brings pleasure (dopamine hits)  hence more extreme porn  more drugs  more video games  etc.

The brain doesn’t distinguish between good or bad  we do that socially and individually.

Addiction is just a pattern of behavior that becomes unconscious. If something gives us a feeling of certainty  has variety  provides a sense of significance  and we have a connection to it  all while it being pleasurable… you created an addiction.

But how to you break it? Or change it?

First off  become aware of the pattern.

Realize your “craving” is for dopamine and other neuro chemicals  not porn  or whatever the thing is. You simply have connected lots of pleasure to that thing.

Break the pattern by doing something completely outside the pattern. These might work:

•	⁠Exercise
•	⁠Ice Bath
•	⁠Video Call a Friend
•	⁠Go Shopping
•	⁠Any form of service

The point is to do something you aren’t used to that takes focus to complete.

You can ABSOLUTELY use that creative energy to accomplish new things.

Breaking the pattern and creating a new one is just a part of it. Now you need to redirect the energy and attach more pleasure to a new activity than to porn.

Getting LOTS of sunshine helps. Btw.

There are multiple ways to break this  that is just one that works!",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1fi4v18/helping_addiction_process/,helping addiction process,put comment though useful others see first nothing wrong let get way big issue today however treatment dont work well would like break addiction know brain work seek brings pleasure dopamine hit hence extreme porn drug video game etc brain doesnt distinguish good bad socially individually addiction pattern behavior becomes unconscious something give u feeling certainty variety provides sense significance connection pleasurable created addiction break change first become aware pattern realize craving dopamine neuro chemical porn whatever thing simply connected lot pleasure thing break pattern something completely outside pattern might work exercise ice bath video call friend go shopping form service point something arent used take focus complete absolutely use creative energy accomplish new thing breaking pattern creating new one part need redirect energy attach pleasure new activity porn getting lot sunshine help btw multiple way break one work

Hi everyone I’m a 22F and I don’t even know why I’m posting this  but I guess I just need to put it somewhere. I’ve never felt this alone in my life. Because of family circumstances  I can’t leave the house much  and it’s made it almost impossible to maintain friendships or make new ones. I struggle with my mental health already  and I don’t want to keep leaning on the few people I have—I feel like I’m just exhausting them.

But the truth is  I really  really just want friends. I want people to talk to  to laugh with  to feel like I exist in the world outside these four walls. Instead  every day feels the same  and I’m just here  invisible  while life moves on without me.

mentalhealth,Intellectual Loneliness Is The Saddest Form Of Isolation,"Have you ever felt like no one truly understands the way you think? Not just in a ""no one gets me"" kind of way  but in a deep  fundamental sense—like your thoughts operate on a completely different wavelength from those around you?

It’s not about being smarter than others; it’s about craving conversations that go beyond the surface level—discussing philosophy  abstract concepts  or life’s deeper questions—only to find that most people either don’t care or don’t understand. You ended up being alienated. You try to explain your thoughts  but they either get dismissed or met with blank stares. Over time  you stop sharing  realizing it’s easier to keep your mind to yourself than to constantly feel misunderstood.

It’s an isolating experience. You can be surrounded by people  yet feel completely alone. Small talk feels exhausting  and the rare moments of connection—when you finally meet someone who resonates with your ideas—feel fleeting. You wonder if it’s even possible to find true intellectual companionship.

People like Nietzsche  Albert Einstein  Nikola Tesla  Allan Turing  Isaac Newton; almost all of the people who have intellectual trait suffered isolation due to their odd thinking and beliefs.

Society doesn’t acknowledge loneliness especially this kind of loneliness. If you lack social connections  people sympathize. But if you’re intellectually alone  they assume you’re just weird or overly complicated. They don’t see that this kind of isolation eats away at you  making the world feel smaller and more disconnected. This type of loneliness feels like you're drowning.

I’m struggling a lot with intense fear that i won’t be able to find a social circle or build community. She is so good at making connections with professors  finding community groups for her passions in the city  different social teams at work  mutual friends with her already established circles  etc. I’m grateful that i’ve never really had issue finding friends in college  but i keep hearing people talk about how much harder it is to find friends when you’re not constantly forced to be around and working with people your age. Also the concept of the male loneliness epidemic keeps getting brought up  and i’m just scared.

mentalhealth,My words drove my girlfriend to a suicide attempt,"I (20f) had an argument with my (21f) gf yesterday and I ended up saying some very mean things to her out of anger  I told her i was sick of her and basically implied i would leave her. I realized what I had done and went to apologize 20minutes after i said these things. However it seemed like she had been drinking heavily during the argument and when I texted her again she wasn't spelling anything correctly   I pretty much couldnt make out anything she was saying   but i was able to make out the words ""arm"" and ""ambulance"" so i called her immediately. she was crying out loud begging me to go see her saying she couldnt move or breathe and that she was bleeding. she lives a 1hr walk away from me so i was panicking because it would take me too long to get to her house and it was late at night. i hung up on her to tell her friend what was going on but when i called back again after like 2min her phone was off. 



after this i just immediately left the house to go see her. i couldnt call an ambulance because i didnt know what her exact home address was  she lives in a huge neighborhood with lots of houses that look the same and we've always went there together so i got lost for a bit trying to find it myself   my plan was to call an ambulance once i found her house but when i got there there were cops and they told me they had already taken her to the hospital and that she was alright. i wasnt in my right mind so i didnt even ask which hospital and refused to answer any question the cops asked  once i heard she was ok i left to go back home before it could get way too late. 



the next day it fucking hit me that i have no idea where she is   i have no idea who called the ambulance bc it wasnt me or the only other person who knew   her phone is still dead   she doesnt talk much to her family members so i dont have their numbers and i have no one to ask about her but thankfully a woman from the hospital she was in contacted me to tell me they were sending her to what is basically a mental asylum. i live in an extremely shitty country so the room they had put her in was a fucked up small room with just a bed in it  nothing else. it broke my heart to see her alone and scared in that hellhole covered in dried blood stains and lots of bandages wrapped around her arm. she's basically imprisoned  she's being treated in such an inhumane way that i dont even want to talk about and they said they would keep her in there for a while. 



i cant wrap my head around the fact that if i had never said those words this would've never happened. i cant believe that i could've lost the person i love the most over the fact i chose to be a mean bitch despite knowing how much her entire mental state depends on me and how scared she is of losing me. she tried to end her own life because she thought i was going to leave her. i have no idea how im supposed to live with this guilt   this has probably been the worst 24 hours of my life and i cant believe everything was normal just a day ago and now she's gonna lose her job and be treated like a psycho for the rest of her life just because of this. im in so much pain that i dont even have the words to describe it bc ive never been in this situation before. tomorrow i have to get in her house to get her phone and clothes and i dont know how ill react when i see her blood on the floor. i dont know how to deal with this and i have no one to rely on  please help me.",50,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1j614cs/my_words_drove_my_girlfriend_to_a_suicide_attempt/,word drove girlfriend suicide attempt,20f argument 21f gf yesterday ended saying mean thing anger told sick basically implied would leave realized done went apologize 20minutes said thing however seemed like drinking heavily argument texted wasnt spelling anything correctly pretty much couldnt make anything saying able make word arm ambulance called immediately cry loud begging go see saying couldnt move breathe bleeding life 1hr walk away panicking would take long get house late night hung tell friend going called back like 2min phone immediately left house go see couldnt call ambulance didnt know exact home address life huge neighborhood lot house look weve always went together got lost bit trying find plan call ambulance found house got cop told already taken hospital alright wasnt right mind didnt even ask hospital refused answer question cop asked heard ok left go back home could get way late next day fucking hit idea idea called ambulance bc wasnt person knew phone still dead doesnt talk much family member dont number one ask thankfully woman hospital contacted tell sending basically mental asylum live extremely shitty country room put fucked small room bed nothing else broke heart see alone scared hellhole covered dried blood stain lot bandage wrapped around arm shes basically imprisoned shes treated inhumane way dont even want talk said would keep cant wrap head around fact never said word wouldve never happened cant believe couldve lost person love fact chose mean bitch despite knowing much entire mental state depends scared losing tried end life thought going leave idea im supposed live guilt probably worst 24 hour life cant believe everything normal day ago shes gon na lose job treated like psycho rest life im much pain dont even word describe bc ive never situation tomorrow get house get phone clothes dont know ill react see blood floor dont know deal one rely please help

SuicideWatch,Switching From Passively Suicidal to Actively Suicidal Actually Gave Me Relief?,"*Has anyone else had this feeling? Or find it somewhat relatable?*

I \[24M\] have been passively suicidal for a few months now  but yesterday was an exceptionally awful day. I slept super late  I forgot I was scheduled to work  couldn't get dressed  couldn't leave the house  tried to fix my bike but ended up breaking it even more. Then I gave into pretty much all of my self-sabotaging vices (drugs  porn  shitty food  video games  you name it). 

  
I swear something snapped. I cried a *ridiculous* amount throughout the day and spent the rest of the night feverishly reading up on suicide. I actually figured out my gameplan. I found a whole document outlining the specifics and answered all the little questions I had (sorry not sharing — don't even ask me) plus a backup option in case I'm desperate enough to do something quicker. For now  I'm in the stage of acquiring the materials and getting my affairs in order.

  
Since I got my suicide method figured out  I'm in a strangely upbeat mood. 

It's an odd paradox. Finalizing my plan of action to end my life made me feel motivated to go out and live it. I'm getting chores done with no sweat  I'm dancing and listening to fun music  I'm gaining bits of my personality back. A great weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

From what I heard  it's common for people to act calm or joyful the days before they make an attempt. Is that what I'm experiencing? Maybe it's because I have a goal now? Like my days don't feel meaningless like they persistently have? Or maybe finally there's an escape route to break free from the shitshow that is my life. I don't feel as trapped and hopeless anymore. 

Anyways  I wanted to see if this anyone here had a similar experience or wants to weigh in on this situation.

TL:DR - I'm actively suicidal for the first time in my life and I feel much better after I figured out my method. What's the meaning behind this?

Depression made me dumb  uninteresting  made me stop reading books  made me stop learning  caused me to spend days like a zombie  caused me amnesia  literally caused my brain to shrink. But the worst was the effect it had after 15 years of fucking my brain. Now I lost my mind. Now i lost that quirky weird fun personality. Now i have lost the cultured nerd that i used to be. I had to grow up getting bullied for being a nerd  for being weird  for not poisoning my mind with mindless activities and TV.

Then I grew up and I lost all of those qualities that were supposed to make me have a cool life and cool friends finally. I wanted to be in the art community  going to talks and book readings and exhibitions and come back from it open a bottle of wine and drink it around the aged wooden table which stands in the middle of the living room that is surrounded by weird and classic paintings  contemporary sculptures and talk about philosophy. I was supposed to be the cultured smart weird but interesting guy. I WAS THAT GUY. I was born to be that guy.

But depression fucked me. And for the past 5 years I had set the goal to become that person again. The real me. But i have not only failed but I have rotten even further. Depression is a disease and has to be dealt with early on  otherwise there's no point in living like a half vegetable  high on antidepressants during the day and sleeping while on benzos at night.

I lost 2 women I truly loved due to my depression. Due to them thinking that I was that cultured smart creative and deep thinker  only to find out I had nothing to talk about  I wasn't able to form arguments  wasn't able to debate on topics  hadn't read many books  didn't know anything about art or culture and was simply boring and dumb to them. It's my worst nightmare come true. People ditching and telling me I'm uninteresting. This was NOT SUPPOSED TO BE my life. I deserved to be loved and experience that love with her after years of patience  years of pain and sorrow. I persevered. I don't accept this anymore. I tried to change but it doesn't work. I can't read anymore. My brain is fucked and I've literally lost so many IQ points that i don't understand what people tell me. My brain is too slow. And while reading i forget the sentences i read after a couple of seconds so I can't connect them and comprehend the story. I live in the moment. I can only hold 5 seconds of life in my mind. I lost my creativity. My ability to imagine and see while my eyes are closed.

Oh my god we would have been so perfect for each other. She is my female version. I am her. And she is exactly the person I wanted to be. Maybe that's why I love her so much. And as mad and hurt as I am for the way she treated me  I really can't blame her for not wanting me. I wouldn't want this ""me"" either. But it hurts so much because i know how i used to be. I know how my life would have turned out without the depression. Its so fucking painful. A family member killed himself a couple of years ago and that was less painful. It was shocking but this daily constant pain  this living through my nightmares is unbearable.

SuicideWatch,Feeling overwhelmed specially at night,"
Last two years  I’ve been struggling with the fact that I am unattractive to women  and it’s been weighing heavily on me. During the day  I can usually distract myself by keeping busy—working  playing video games  or talking with friends. But at night  when everything quiets down  it’s just me and my thoughts  and it becomes unbearable.

At first  I was just sad about it. Then  I started crying occasionally. Now  it’s progressed to the point where I’m having suicidal thoughts  and I even find myself thinking about specific methods that i think would be possible for me. I know I wouldn’t act on these impulses right now because I have my mom to live for. But her health is in terrible shape after COVID  and I’m terrified of what might happen when she’s no longer here. I feel like I’ll have nothing left to hold onto.

To be honest I don't have an specific reason to write this post  just to write some of my thoughts I think",2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1itrgut/feeling_overwhelmed_specially_at_night/,feeling overwhelmed specially night,last two year ive struggling fact unattractive woman weighing heavily day usually distract keeping busyworking playing video game talking friend night everything quiet thought becomes unbearable first sad started cry occasionally progressed point im suicidal thought even find thinking specific method think would possible know wouldnt act impulse right mom live health terrible shape covid im terrified might happen shes longer feel like ill nothing left hold onto honest dont specific reason write post write thought think
SuicideWatch,I am overwhelmed by my senses,I get very overwhelmed easily by my senses  mainly sounds and visuals. I use most of my day practicing piano  which already is loud but bearable  because its music  and I also live at home. My dad is also home a lot and is very loud. He constantly burps and passes gas  which may sound foolish or funny for someone who doesn’t live with it  but it is unbearable to live with I think. His face and stare also sends shivers down my spine and I want to rip my skin off where ever his eyes land on me. I have told him to stop  but he says he can do what he wants in his house. ‘What  I can even burp in my own home?’ I have no solution to this and I already think living is unbearable and unamusing. My thoughts have no where to be and my head is constantly filled with a fog of distractions and worrying. I cant move  because I have no money or job for it. I have no where to go. I wish someone would just spend a few minutes reading this or commenting so my suffering/worrying can be some what freed from my soul.

SuicideWatch,I feel like everything I try to do fails and feeling overwhelmed (venting),"I’m just feeling extremely overwhelmed at the  moment and probably worse than I’ve ever felt (which is an understatement because I am depressed and have been for 8 years now). My issue is that I am actively trying to improve my circumstances and situation however it’s like every time I try a new hurdle or obstacle comes in my way and then I start to think maybe I’m not supposed to be here because I don’t understand why things must always be so difficult. 

So I have recently started a new job because I am so deep into debt so I thought increasing my salary would help and now I can see a way out of my problems. But now that I’ve been working at this new job  I’ve realised that I hate it. It’s so stressful and hard and the people are not that supportive or nice infact they don’t like me I can feel it and then also at the same time of starting this new role my family member then became so unwell and I’ve had to take time off to sort that out when I have just started. I can’t even concentrate at work and I’m new. I know that they must think I’m not serious but it’s hard to try and concentrate when a parent is sick and I’m worried that I’ll get fired. I have been transparent even before joining but ppl pretend to understand when they don’t.

I think I’m upset because I have felt suicidal for years now I had completely given up but I thought let me try one more time. I have tried to apply myself improve my circumstances but honestly if feels like every time I try to get ahead something will happen immediately to drag me back down. Life shouldn’t be this difficult surely. It’s like I’m meant to be miserable and honestly I just want to be happy. I don’t want constant issues and hurdles to jump over all the time it has been this way for so long. Then I start to think it’s a sign  I’m not meant to be here. I should really go and even that trying to leave it’s not easy. Because there isn’t a painless way so I feel stuck and drained and miserable. I don’t want to be miserable forever. But also I don’t know what to do. I will call the Samaritans this evening. I honestly want to live but it’s like I’m not meant to.

A group of people at my college have been making fun of me because of a health condition I can’t control. They made a video about me  calling me names and spreading rumors. Now  whenever people see me  they recognize me and continue to harass me.I’m at home right now and can’t approach my college authorities in person. I’ve tried asking for help from some classmates  but they’re not responding. I don’t have access to the video  but I know it’s been shared widely  and I’m feeling completely helpless and humiliated. This is affecting my mental health  and I don’t know how to stop it.

I need advice on how to handle this situation. Is there a way to report this video without knowing where it is? Can someone help me figure out what steps to take next? I just want this to stop and to find some peace. Please  any help or guidance is appreciated.

SuicideWatch,My brother is addicted to cuckold porn after being cheated on and suicidal. I need advice on how to help him.,"So I've posted this situation before elsewhere  but didn't get much advice and ppl thought i was fake 💀. but I'm lost right now and have no answers.

Basically my twin brother's ex cheated on him with a guy with a bigger dick.

He confided in me that after this happened  he feels sexually worthless. He's been addicted to cuckold porn. He's insecure in himself and his dick size  depressed  and suicidal.

He's so insecure and has no motivation for anything. His self esteem is so so low.

Hes also into some extreme stuff tbh. Like he told me he was reading porn/erotica on reddit where the wife fucked the husband's bully (the guy who used to beat up the husband in high school  in the porn)  and he got off to it harder than ever. And afterwards he felt like killing himself. I feel so terrible for him.

And he's not an unattractive guy either: he's strong  muscular  athletic af and a huge jock (was a former D1 wrestler and teammates with my husband)  funny  smart  etc. Even my girlfriends say he's hot  so im not just being biased cuz he's my brother. Oh  and he's a hero too: he saved me from being raped by my uncle when we were both teens.

And yes  he's been going to therapy. It's not working; he's still depressed  suicidal  insecure  etc. I've asked for help from literally everywhere  idk what to do now.

I can't sleep right now. Im so so worried for my brother. I'm worried he might harm himself any moment.

Any advice is much appreciated.

Can anyone please help?,So Ive been able to have lucid dreams at will for all my life (all I need to do is drink coffee and sleep on my back) and Ive always enjoyed them  but recently  that is all Ive been looking forward to. I now find real life mundane and boring. In my dreams I can do what I want  fuck who I want  travel to space  and fly to where I please. It has become an addiction and I no longer have the urge to hang out with my friends or talk to my family. I just wanna stay home and wait for sleep to kick in so that I can start the process.

SuicideWatch,Loneliness is killing me,"Just like the title says  i can't bear it any longer and I'm burdening everyone around me too since i get worse and worse. It's not enough. It's never enough. I have two attentive parents that take care of me despite being an adult  i have developed lots of self love and acceptance and i have two wonderful friends and an adorable dog but it's just never enough. I still feel this unbearable loneliness and nothing fulfills me. I have suicidal thoughts daily. I constantly feel a physical pain in my chest. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on what to do when i can't stand the loneliness? I can't reach out to my friends all the time because they have their own lives and my family has their issues so i don't want to burden or worry them all the time. I don't trust professionals either and i don't have the energy or courage for social interactions at least not face to face. I'm very sensitive and fragile and anything people say could end up fueling my suicidal thoughts. I'm not open to taking any drugs or vitamins either. Am i hopeless? Sorry for being difficult.

Currently  i just try to indulge in my hobbies but even that reminds me of how lonely i am because i always do them alone. I wish i had someone to play with. For now  i just play and try to distract myself and not think that i have no one to play with or chat with. I also vent around subreddits but again  it doesn't really do much to make me feel better

SuicideWatch,I'm 32 years old and don't think I can handle the loneliness anymore. I just want a wife so badly  but I don't think it's ever going to happen.,"Ever since I've been young  the #1 thing I've wanted out of life is a strong  happy marriage  but for whatever reason I've never been very successful with women.  I feel like I have a tremendous amount of love to give  and I just want to find someone who loves me back and with whom I can spend the rest of my life.  I'm so lonely.

At my age  the statistical reality is that the majority of people who want to get married have already done so.  Meanwhile  I can't even find a girlfriend  let alone a wife.  I don't really understand what's so wrong with me.  On paper  I'm not perfect  but I don't think I'm unworthy of love.  I'm very highly educated (two doctorates)  and while my income isn't anything special  it's decent (~$150k).  I know I'm not attractive  but I don't think I'm repulsively ugly  and I'm not short (6'0"").  I will admit that I'm fat  but I don't think that's the main reason I've struggled so much romantically because I'm perfectly willing to date/marry a fat woman (in fact I'd actually prefer it).  And lord knows I'd gladly spoil the hell out of any woman who showed interest in me (I'd be perfectly fine with a stay-at-home wife if that's what she wanted).  And I'm not even picky; I'm pretty open-minded and willing to give anyone a chance as long as she doesn't have/want children (that being the one issue on which I can't compromise).  So why am I so alone when most people are able to find someone?  It's horribly depressing.

To make matters worse  there's no one whom I can even really talk to about this.  I'll probably get attacked for saying it  but I don't believe that women can experience loneliness to the same extent as men.  And if there is any woman reading this and thinking  ""You're wrong because I'm just as lonely as you are "" then I'll go ahead and prove you wrong.  I am **LITERALLY** willing to buy a plane ticket next week (01/29-02/02) to anywhere in the entire country  take any lonely woman out to a nice dinner  and rent a hotel room so we can cuddle and watch movies afterward.  And no  I'm not using ""cuddle"" as a euphemism for sex.  I genuinely just want to hold someone and have them hold me back.  But I can already tell you that no one is going to take me up on this offer  which proves my point that women don't get it because they have options  just not the ones they want.  But people like me have literally no one who wants them.

I've thought about asking a prostitute if she'd be willing to just snuggle with me and watch a movie without having to involve sex (from what I've read  they're sometimes open to unconventional requests like that)  but my therapist and my mom both say that it's just going to make me even sadder because it won't be real.  And they're probably right  but what else am I to do?  I don't want to live like this.  I'm never happy.  All I do is leave work and then just exist until I have to go back to work (I've never been someone who enjoyed platonic friendships).  So what's the point?  I've thought about trying to make it to 40 and then just shooting myself if/when I'm still alone  but I don't know if I can suffer like this for eight more years.  If it weren't for the fact that I don't want to upset my mom  I may have already done it by now.

Nobody's advice is actually helpful.  My therapist just keeps telling me things like  ""I have countless female clients who would love to be with someone like you "" ""I'll help you through the dating process "" and ""I'm completely confident that you'll find someone who wants to be with you after a few first dates.""  And while I do really like him  those things just feel like empty platitudes when no one is even willing to give me a chance at a first date to begin with.

If you've ever heard the Travis Tritt song ""Drift Off to Dream "" that's basically me.  I so desperately want to fall in love and spend the rest of my life with someone who genuinely cares about me.

SuicideWatch,Switching From Passively Suicidal to Actively Suicidal Actually Gave Me Relief?,"*Has anyone else had this feeling? Or find it somewhat relatable?*

I \[24M\] have been passively suicidal for a few months now  but yesterday was an exceptionally awful day. I slept super late  I forgot I was scheduled to work  couldn't get dressed  couldn't leave the house  tried to fix my bike but ended up breaking it even more. Then I gave into pretty much all of my self-sabotaging vices (drugs  porn  shitty food  video games  you name it). 

  
I swear something snapped. I cried a *ridiculous* amount throughout the day and spent the rest of the night feverishly reading up on suicide. I actually figured out my gameplan. I found a whole document outlining the specifics and answered all the little questions I had (sorry not sharing — don't even ask me) plus a backup option in case I'm desperate enough to do something quicker. For now  I'm in the stage of acquiring the materials and getting my affairs in order.

  
Since I got my suicide method figured out  I'm in a strangely upbeat mood. 

It's an odd paradox. Finalizing my plan of action to end my life made me feel motivated to go out and live it. I'm getting chores done with no sweat  I'm dancing and listening to fun music  I'm gaining bits of my personality back. A great weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

From what I heard  it's common for people to act calm or joyful the days before they make an attempt. Is that what I'm experiencing? Maybe it's because I have a goal now? Like my days don't feel meaningless like they persistently have? Or maybe finally there's an escape route to break free from the shitshow that is my life. I don't feel as trapped and hopeless anymore. 

Anyways  I wanted to see if this anyone here had a similar experience or wants to weigh in on this situation.

TL:DR - I'm actively suicidal for the first time in my life and I feel much better after I figured out my method. What's the meaning behind this?

I didn't try to even walk to her. I had to take distance from her  and forced myself to shrug it off. I then saw her with her mom  and I felt even worse.

I have OCD. But I don't think it makes me confuse underage girls online with women in their early twenties.

I remember how I have sometimes seen a hot ""woman"" online.

Then I've seen a post mention she's fucking underage. And she looked over that for me.

I have barely ever gotten such thoughts.

Yes  age of consent is a societal construct. Biology is far behind that.

This doesn't mean it's ok to be a pedophile.

But what the fuck can I do about this?!

And now I'm also a fucking pedophile. I can't fucking take this. I just want to fucking die. What the hell did I do to be born into such a person?! There's nothing I can fucking do!

I've thought that I've just been always the victim to people. Yeah  I've been done heavily wrong.

But I also realized that I don't even deserve love or acceptance. I don't deserve hope when I have a brain like this.

Never once have I ever tried to sexually even approach underage people  approach at all.

When I was a teenager  I found a girl 2-3 years older than me to be attractive. And there were another guy and we kind of played with her and her younger brother. I was underage too.

And I've felt so fucking shit about that as well.

SuicideWatch,I am getting married in 2 months  I want to kill myself before it happens,"A marriage I don't like 

A life I don't want

My parents who are dead

Relatives who act as didn't hear when I tell I am suicidal 


Lived whole life trying to please others   always self doubting   always careful to not cross line.

I don't want to live like a coward anymore. I want to be brave and take decision for myself now and the first thing I want to do is break this marriage   I can only achieve it by being dead


Edit : thank you all for your supporting words. Yesterday night I talked with my sister in law about this . How I am suffering and how suicidal I am. Sh was understanding and said kind words  told I should start sharing if I felt like that. I shared how i am not able to get along with him  and she said she understood and told me i should have shared sooner. I felt very relived. I slept peacefullyafter a long time. Today morning she is acting like nothing happened  talking about marriage plans like how we should check out community hall for pre wedding functions  rent a bus for grooms guests   talking about post marriage things. Talking as if yesterday didn't happen

I'm going crazy  what did I do wrong ? Maybe I was right all along   only death can get me out of this madness

I have a good job. I have a family. I have some friends. I eat healthy. I go to the fucking piece of shit gym everyday and I lift. I run until I can’t. I take stupid meds my psychiatrist gave me. I go to therapy(which is useless). In the end nothing has really changed. I am still alone. I feel a void in my life. I have no purpose and I don’t know why I’m here. I still want to die.

SuicideWatch,i told my mum i want to kill myself. she said  “ok  just don’t do it in my house.”,"that’s basically it. it hurts. i wish people didn’t romanticise a mother’s love so much because then maybe these words wouldn’t sting as much as they did. how is a teenager supposed to feel when the one person who’s apparently supposed to love them more than anyone and anything  doesn’t?

edit: 
yes  I totally understand that parents are just human beings...but when a relationship  any type of relationship  starts to cause damage to one and the other knows this but refuses to acknowledge it or somehow change for the better  then they simply do not care for the person. I only opened up to my mum about depression very recently though I’ve been dealing with it for a few years now. at first  I used to think the reason I was constantly hurt by her actions and words was because she didn’t know the mental state I was in back then so I never blamed her in anyway. but it all became too much that i impulsively told her everything and she still refused to do anything. she’s not empathetic in the slightest and she made it clear that whether I commit suicide or not doesn’t matter to her as long as  like I said in the og post  I do not do it in her house or say anything in my suicide letter about her that’ll give her a bad rep or get her in any trouble. point is  I thought I was suffering so much because I kept my feelings to myself. I thought sharing them raw with her would help even a little but it didn’t and I feel so defeated. people always say you shouldn’t keep these type of things to yourself but there’s comfort in that. giving myself the illusion that the only reason I hurt is because I keep it to myself hurts less than sharing it with others and realising that that hasn’t changed the way i feel. you don’t suddenly get better. it only stays just as bad or gets worse. 

and to anyone and everyone who’s sharing similar stuff  I’m sorry that some of your most treasured people aroused some of the most negative feelings in you. it’s okay to feel hurt but don’t let someone else’s decision to be a dick affect your own life decisions because in the end  everyone will be looking back at their own life and their own life only. make sure that yours isn’t just a reflection of what others have said and done to you.

i apologise if this is really lengthy I know I keep rambling I just wasn’t expecting this many people to see this. to everyone who’s tried to help or who’s hurting  you have a special place in my heart.

SuicideWatch,I am so unattractive that I want to kill myself,"I am a severely unattractive person. It hurts me so much to live with this face. Seeing myself in the mirror or photos kills my self-confidence. I do not only have to deal with the dread of seeing my own horrifying reflection  but also the treatment that I receive from others. I have had people move places when I sat next to them. When I talk to people they have this look in their eyes that signals disgust. I have been made fun in front of my face on several occasions. I have been told I am ugly both online and in real life. 

It’s not an issue of weight. I have a healthy and normal body weight. I dress well. I keep my hygiene. The issue is my face. I have facial features and a facial structure that can not be improved through plastic surgery. 

I get so jealous of women my age. I keep constantly seeing beautiful women all around me. They have everything I don’t. I feel like an ogre next to them. 

I hate writing this as it makes me feel weak. I want to be able to deal with my emotions without having to spew them out to strangers online. But I feel that I can’t take this anymore.

loneliness, cheating  suicide or kill thoughts,"I have been subjected to a financial as well as a professional cheating by my close relative which is consider myself as a brother. I worked for him and because of his words I spend 3 years with him. He told me I will be rewarded at the end. My salary was pending for 21 months and I haven't asked him because I knew him he was struggling. I wanted to end my job in his company after one year but he told me to stay for bit more and it lasted to e years. But at the end he only paid me salary of 15 months without any increment. Ath the same time till my birth my father ( who died before my birth) took all his money ( my father was soo rich at that time ). They stayed at my house in which the father build it for us. My father died just after 6 months of marriage with my mother. So she went back to her home. So I was taken care off my grandparents. But still my house and an another small property was their and the house. Obtaining area was multi owned owners including me my mom and  my father's parents as per shariah rule. But my father's father was not interested in sharing that property and we went to court but in a cinema style incident our advocate cheated us.
While I was studying in 5th standard my mother married another guy and she gone with him and I was fully taken care of my mother's parents. But I heard they saying their inability to take care of me kid every day ( but they have done their duty well especially my grandmother) . In my childhood I was a pro introvert and I don't have much friends too. My plus 2 life gave me a new charactor. But after that I never had any new friends or others. I never had any girlfriends. Once I had a crush on collage   but all my so called friends where supporting a senior guy who also had crush on her. So I decided to stay away from relationships because I know I won't be having any such things and I know nobody will be loving me. 
Since then most of the time I speak with trees or some non living beings or even myself. After college I started earning and then my relative guy came to my life. 
Also on last month I bought the property ownership of my father's relatives and I wanted to sell my land and start a new career.But still they block the sale of the land and they never wanted me to be a success man. 
I never misbehaved with any of the people or i somehow wanted to be nice with everyone. But no one loves me back or even some people even without any reason wanted me to get hurt. Now I am getting the suicide thoughts or like some one is murnering to kill the guys who cheat me or to commit suicide and escape from the world. Right now I don't have any job  no gf  no home   no money and nothing . 
I donno what to do

like yeah ive had many many factors in my life that led me to where i am today like my long history of being abused by other people  but the person i spoke to told me that my worth isnt defined by how people treat me...and dude. when i read that. i cried. i looked in the mirror and i fucking cried. i needed to hear that so badly its insane. 



i also learned that its okay to exist...im not a very productive person most of the time and i often beat myself up for that  but   its okay to just exist. even if im not employed right now...my dad will still love me and wont abandon me. especially since hes spent most of his life fighting custody for me

loneliness,Thoughts of non-existence and suicide within the context of loneliness,"I have realized that  when alone  but when im not fully isolated  such as when i have goone to clasroom or some friend has talked to me that day  I will most of the times end up with the track of thought of ""phisical non-existence would be better""  sometimes with and sometimes without the suicidal tone that is normaly added to that sentence.

Should this fact be contrasted by itself  it may seem like textbook depresion  which it's why these other 2 facts seem so fascinating to me.

The first   that when with those persons  I most of the time feel good  not great by itself  but definitely not suicidal. 

Yet when I have not contacted with anyone for a few days  like it's common with my semiperiodic self isolation phases  I feel okay. Not great  not even good  but I definitely feel better than a few hours after the ""social contact"" itself.

I think that this may be due to that when I'm with someone I realize all I'm missing in a social life  such as friends and people who love me  which  come the time I am finally alone and the ""social feromones"" have gone down  I realize my life is shit.

I've come to say to myself ""I hope it gets better or worse""  in the meaning that having someone to be with as myself and love is good  absolute loneliness does seem bad  but the middle point  when I'm lonely but not lonely enough to be ignorant of my loneliness is hell in my own bedroom.

loneliness,Lonely Depressed,"Hi 

I 26 M have been struggling with connection through out my life and would go years in between some relationships that never last more than 6 months.

My confidence has never been “healthy” and recently has been the lowest that it’s ever been.

I’ve had hinge for a few weeks and have gotten 2 matches. 1 of which messaged me first last week. We hit it off on the app and set a date 2 days later to get a drink after her short work shift. She mostly inniated idea of coffee & card/board game for a first date.  We ended up changing this to a drink cus her shift was in the Am.

I recommended a spot and she did not respond for 24 hours which concerned me considering she was triple texting me and i thought we liked each other. She texted me morning of date and said she had to bail but implied we could reschedule. 

So far  she hasn’t responded but even if she did i don’t think that I should entertain her behavior to me taking day(s) to get back to me. 

This sparked my anxiety and on Sunday i spent day watching football game and My friend (who is crazy popular) introduced me to his friend that’s a girl. 

She was nice to me and we had things to talk about. She came alone only knowing my friend who introduced us in a group of maybe 11-13 people. She was the only single girl but not only girl. So when he was talking to other friends me and her would talk. 

End of night a different guy in the group walked her home. I was very upset/ jealous and already upset from Hinge date ghosting me yesterday.

I long for connection and have resorted to making a wall of pillows in my bed to feel like i am next to someone.",3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1ib6x71/lonely_depressed/,lonely depressed,hi 26 struggling connection life would go year relationship never last 6 month confidence never healthy recently lowest ever ive hinge week gotten 2 match 1 messaged first last week hit app set date 2 day later get drink short work shift mostly inniated idea coffee cardboard game first date ended changing drink cu shift recommended spot respond 24 hour concerned considering triple texting thought liked texted morning date said bail implied could reschedule far hasnt responded even dont think entertain behavior taking day get back sparked anxiety sunday spent day watching football game friend crazy popular introduced friend thats girl nice thing talk came alone knowing friend introduced u group maybe 1113 people single girl girl talking friend would talk end night different guy group walked home upset jealous already upset hinge date ghosting yesterday long connection resorted making wall pillow bed feel like next someone

loneliness,32 m  going through a hard time again in life. Depressed  lonely  feel empty. Just need someone to talk to.,"I’m 32  going through a rough time yet again. Living with my ex but separately in the same house. For the time being at least. We had been together for about 3.5 years. Living together a majority of that.   She was my best friend  but now I don’t have that anymore. We were together almost every day  I have friends  but I guess we have become distant due to the nature of my relationship.. it’s hard to reach out to anyone. Even my family  I hate the feeling of being a burden. Everyone has their own life and problems  lately I just have been so down  depressed  empty. Drinking to forget about shit.

Somehow I always manage to ruin the good things I have… honestly it’s just fucking hard. Sometimes I just sit for hours doing absolutely nothing. Some days I feel good enough to get out and do something. I spiral a lot at night. Because it’s the quietest and when I feel most alone.  I don’t even necessarily need to talk about my problems. Just someone to talk to  it’s hard when you just feel like you need someone but there is no one.

loneliness,Had a breakup while studying abroad and am feeling lonely and depressed since then.,"

Last year  I came to Germany for my masters. I have been pretty independent my whole life and being on my own didn’t bother me much. I was single when I came here and was focusing on my career and getting integrated into the culture. Cut to 3-4 months after that  I was approached by a guy from my uni and we did hit it off. It was clear from the beginning that we were dating for something serious. We had our ups and downs and it seemed he was not that serious into me. Now here  I made a mistake and kept giving this thing a try. I kept trying to put in more efforts but he would always disappoint me by canceling plans  telling me he feels pressure etc. Suddenly  things started getting better after 2-3 months and he changed a lot. But the lying and hiding things still continued. Here is when I became restless and was fighting with him out of frustration. Everything he did made me feel miserable about myself. One fine day  he ended things with me saying I am too emotional and he can’t take it anymore. It all came a day after he said he is lucky to have me. This sudden shock made me feel terrible. This was almost 4 months ago. I went through a lot of panic attacks and anxiety and it affected my studies and part-time job. Now  most of my friends have gone back to our home country and I am all alone here. I can’t help but feel lonely and miserable. A part of me still feels angry that while I am all sad and miserable here  he is enjoying his life to the fullest.

loneliness,How to stop this overwhelming loneliness feeling,"I'm 29F (almost 30) and moved out of my family home just over 3 years ago. I don't regret that because I know it would damage my mental health more if I had stayed. Anyway  since moving out my family rarely bother to visit me. My mum hasn't bothered in almost 2 years despite saying she would visit when I moved out. One of my sister's (28) only really come with our dad on birthdays and Christmasses. My other sister (23) only comes when we've gone to the cinema or a gig together.

They tend to make excuses all year.round when I've tried hinting so I tend not to bother anymore. When it's the summer  it's usually because it's ""too hot""  most of the other time  it's because my building doesn't have a lift (but it's only a small block of 8 flats) and they don't want to walk up the stairs. If they can't get a taxi to the door  they won't do it  despite the fact that I only live on the other side of the town centre.
All I want is for them to spend a few hours with me. To have a cup of tea  watch a film  have lunch or something  but they never even offer to do that outside  let alone come to my flat for it. I've visit them sometimes but I struggle going back to that house because it can still be a comfort for me and I'm struggle with knowing I'm leaving to go back to the flat. They can come here and leave easily  I can't do that as happily.

I spend most days hoping  and wishing that they might give a surprise visit  but they don't and I just want to stop expecting it but I don't know how to take away that small bit of hope. I have hobbies  but I get bored of them easily  I have no friends (in my city anyway) and an inability to make any because I'm rubbish at it.

loneliness,I feel unnecessary and like an idiot,"Hello  it’s my first time posting on this sub and I think I just wanna vent out my feelings or get maybe reassurances  I don’t know

I’m 17  I know a lot of people but none of them are my friends. I have 3 best friends. One  let’s name her Amy  that talks to me but when I try to vent to her  she says ‘stfu’ or ‘damn’ or ‘wow’ or something similar and I feel like she doesn’t appreciate as much as her other friends.
Sometimes I wonder if she’s talking to me just out of boredom and has no one else to talk to

The second bestfriend  Anna   she doesn’t initiate texting. I have to text first and ask and all and I think I know she has the time to text me but chose not to

When their birthday came around  I sent them paragraphs and posted them and stuff as soon as it was 12am but all I get was ‘happy birthday’ in a short text. I know that my first bestie cares about these things bc she does them to other friends  not the paragraphs maybe but the text at 12am and posting

If they could do that to other friends and people  why not me? Do I lack something? Are her friends more fun and interesting than me?

I think I might be the problem because this happened a lot of times. I wonder what’s it like to have someone love you except your parents 

As for my third bestfriend  Lana   she became friends with another person and I became their third wheel. The things that my friend does might not be big and it’s small but noticeable.

They walk without me  change their seat without me  talk and don’t include me and my friend won’t even look at me  let alone talk to me. Their back is turned to me when they talk together always.

And when I try to include myself I feel like I’m forcing myself into them even though I’ve known my friend longer. A while ago  I was at the worst point of my life  and I came to vent to Lana because I was so overwhelmed and asked her questions about some things I told her before and she said ‘this is something I’m not handling from you tbh and my life isn’t Disneyland and I can always hear you talking like that’.

So yeah I can’t vent to all three of them

I can’t hear from one ear and I wear a hearing aid. When they talk and I can’t hear them  they always brush me off or dismiss me or ‘tell me later’ but never do or get frustrated with me when I can’t hear them and I ask them to repeat it and they just visibly show that they’re frustrated and don’t tell me anymore. I feel like a burden  like I know it’s a disability to not hear but they don’t need to make me feel like that and remind me. It’s hurtful  and I mean all three friends in this paragraph

They each have their own friend groups and other close friends that I’m not in and I feel lonely when I see them together and a feeling of something I can’t tell what it is  idk if it’s jealousy or resentment that they treat their other friends better than they treat me.

When I was in middle school  I was in a big friend group and had one bestfriend between them (rose) and I felt really left out so I talked to her and I don’t remember word-for-word but she said something like I have to include myself and things like that  I felt like she blamed me and made me think that I was the one purposely isolating myself out.

But when I tried to include myself and found out they have a group chat without me  I asked to be added to it and I was added to a group chat they don’t even talk in and had another group chat and I kept sending them funny videos and reels like an idiot when no one replied.

And amy  rose and Anna are friends with the person that literally hurt me the most. I see my friend always having fun with that person more than me because they’re funny and cool and I can’t help but think that I lack something  like they’re better than me. Why does the person that hurt me have lots of friends but I have no one?

When I tried talking to them (rose and Amy) in the past about it  they said that I agreed to them befriending that person and when I vented to rose  she said it’s ‘silly’ and it’s been a long time and she made excuses for the person that hurt me instead of at least comforting me. 

When I want to vent now  I think I’d look pathetic and dramatic. I think I look pathetic when other classmates notice me sitting alone and not talking to anyone.

I feel dramatic whenever I vent about something like it shouldn’t be that big. I feel really silly and like an unnecessary thing in their lives and just lonely.

loneliness,how do you make new friends?,"**Hi.**

I have a somewhat long and maybe somewhat boring story  but it leads to what worries me the most right now.

I’m a 23-year-old man  and for as long as I can remember  people have always ""come"" to me; I never really chose my friends (except once  but that ended  and it was mere coincidence). I’ve kept my childhood friends since we started school together. Some joined along the way  but I don’t really remember how it all began. I’ve always felt some kind of noise or disconnect with them: they are nothing like me  we don’t share hobbies  and the conversations we used to have have lost meaning for me (when there are still any left).

It’s been six years since we graduated from school. They started university before me because I took a gap year  and now they’re graduating while I still have a year left. This has greatly affected our conversations and dynamics—it leaves me with a strange feeling  like we’re in completely different stages of life and there’s no real common ground anymore.

Since high school ended  we’ve only met up to drink and talk about life. Their conversations revolve around their relationships or topics that  in my opinion  should remain private. In general  I’m just not interested. The only thing that connects us is memories that don’t really mean anything anymore. I’ve come to the conclusion that they are no longer for me  and I’m no longer for them.

This feeling became even clearer when my partner’s friend started dating what used to be my best friend. He changed for the worse when he started dating her—he became someone completely different  and not in a good way. Now she hangs out with my friends without me. They still invite me  but I no longer want to go. On top of that  she used to be my friend  but our friendship fell apart  and now she has become a bridge between them that I was left out of. I think this was the last piece I needed to realize that I no longer belong there.

As for my university friends  I feel like they all have too many problems. I feel like a drain for their misery  and apparently  ""that’s what friendship is.""

I’ve always been there for the people who have sought me out. I always respond when someone needs help  within my capabilities. But when I go through a rough time  no one is there for me.

I have bipolar disorder type 2  and lately  I feel an overwhelming loneliness. I no longer find meaning in living; I just feel like I exist. My partner is my only friend  and I don’t want to exhaust that resource.

I’ve realized that I need to meet new people—people with common interests  people I can talk to about things I enjoy  do things together  and build synergy toward shared goals. But honestly  I don’t know how to do that.

That’s why I’m writing here. I’ve tried meeting people through games like Valorant or LoL  apps like Bumble BFF or Boo. I’ve also thought about looking for communities related to my hobbies or interests on Discord or Reddit. But deep down  I feel like I don’t know what I’m doing. It doesn’t feel natural. I have no hope that it will work.

Sometimes I feel like I’m asking for too much  but I just don’t know what to do. Has anyone been through something similar? Do you have any advice or suggestions on how to meet people in a more genuine way?

loneliness,Ever feel like social media is quietly making things worse?,"I came across a study that found around **40% of young people in mental health treatment** reported *problematic social media use -* as in  feeling anxious  frustrated  or even angry when not online.

What struck me is that this kind of use shares traits with addiction: cravings  disrupting daily life  and not being able to stop even when it’s hurting you. These individuals also reported worse depression  anxiety  and suicidal thoughts.

It’s not about saying “just quit social media” - for some  it’s a lifeline. But it made me wonder:

loneliness,I don’t have nobody ,"
My name is Anthony Bookman. My wife passed back in may  and ever since everything went down hill we was struggling beforehand but getting by but after her passing it’s 10x worse all we had was each other. She was from the Philippines but moved here with her aunt and her aunts husband which they were practically upper middle class her family over here are doing well. Her side of the family are rich compared to me and my family which I barely have. You see I was born at 6 months 3 months early due to my mother’s crack addiction I was a breach baby I literally stepped into this world ( I came out foot first) she found out she was pregnant with me at 3 months and continued to do what she do. I think she was trying to get me aborted by crack idk lol but I survived. She never told me the truth about my father which I never met because she was ashamed to admit that she was a prostitute. I was the black sheep of the family I’m the middle child and she always treated me differently. My older brother and little brother was never subjected to the beating she gave me. She was so quick to punch me in my face and embarrass me in front of my friends and girls to keep me humble I guess because I don’t look like anyone I’m related to even though we have a very little family members on my mother side. I was always made fun of and told that they found me in front of Taco Bell because I look Hispanic due to my features. I’m black but due to not knowing my father my ethnicity always is questioned and always asked what else I am mixed with and reluctant to say. I was always jealous of my brothers because they have relationships with they father and came around gave them gifts and took them to places but I had to play it off like it didn’t bother me because whenever I asked about my father she would get mad and make it a big thing about it so I had to learn to keep my mouth shut. So naturally to gravitated to the streets looking for acceptance and subconsciously love I never received in the house hold.  When my mother was pregnant with my little brother when I was 15 I got locked up for robbing the pizza man due to it was never no food in the house because my brother was having a baby also at the same time so majority of the time they was eating out and only time they was bringing in food was for themselves so I had to fend for myself which marked me for a lifetime of struggling to find a career because who wanted to hire a convicted? I was charged as an adult btw. I tried to join the military and rejected. I wanted to go to college but didn’t know what I was doing I didn’t know how to fill out the fasfa application so I just gave up and continued down the wrong path. I was given a settlement at 18 due to getting hit by a car when I was 9 and luckily my grandma before she passed when I was 12 set it up for me to get it when I was 18 because my mother is a narcissistic money hungry delusional selfish person who only cares about herself and her house always comes first. When I turned 18 which I was still in high school I moved out and me and my brother got a apartment which I paid for and him and his baby mother moved into and me being so naive and so happy to be on my own I allowed them to take advantage. I gave my nephew his own room and they had a room and I slept in the living room. I helped put me and my brother through driving school and bought my brother a car. My mother was mad because she couldn’t control me since I was out her house even though I have her 2 000 dollars before we even left the bank. I was awarded 20 000 btw which 5 000 had to go to the lawyer that represented me for the robbery case and agreed to wait till I turn 18. One day my mother called me and demanded that I give her 1 000 dollars just cause with a attitude and in reply I said what you trying to pimp me or something and till this day she tells everyone I never gave her anything and say that was my reply when she asked me for money. I was trying to be conservative and didn’t want to run through my money but in 18 months it was gone. I checked my account one day and I only had 1 000 only to find out that my mother was stealing from me it took me 8 years to put it together I must of had a mental block because I didn’t want to believe it but her address was where I was getting checks and my bank information sent to and when I brought it to her attention about my account status and what I should do because I was highly upset and didn’t know at the time about disputing the charges to my account she played dumb and acted like it wasn’t nothing I can do and she didn’t know what to do so it was back to square one. She always allowed my brother and his family to move back in with her but when it came to me I always had to find a way and beg people to sleep on their couch or house which I never was able to get myself together because I always had to find a place to lay my head at which led me back to the street and another conviction of robbery in which I did 2 years prison time of robbing a drug dealer who told on me. I came home sold drugs here and there and at 25 had my first daughter with a girl I barely knew I got her pregnant having a threesome with her homegirl. I was working temp jobs to stay afloat and then two years later I met the love of my life. She was the only person who showed me love and truly cared about me and my wellbeing and I think she had pity on me because of how I would always bend backwards for the people who shitted on me and opened my eyes about the treatment of my family and that isn’t the way i was supposed to be treated. She ended up getting pregnant with our son Aj and it was basically us against the world and at 3 my son was diagnosed with level 2 autism which strengthened our love and relationship even though our relationship was going up and down like anyone else’s. She passed on may 23 2024 and ever since I haven’t been the same. I lost the only person who truly loved me and now it’s just me and him. We currently in a hotel shelter and I haven’t been able to work do to not having no help or be able to afford a babysitter and the time he goes to school it’s hard to find employment in between the time of that. I’m still waiting on ssi for his medical condition and her survival benefits and it’s super hard and stressful. I’m still grieving but I have to stay strong for our son and luckily she has a strong family relationship who loves our son and takes him from time to time and holidays which I’m very grateful because I never had that growing up. Birthdays and Christmas is just another day for me because after my grandma passed that stuff stopped and now I’m basically at my ropes end and don’t know what to do. I donate plasma twice a week so we can eat for the week and our social service benefits which we was barely getting by on was cut in half which is now basically impossible to get through the end of the month on. I’m getting 150 in foodstamps and 300 in cash benefits and my phone bill is 140. I did have a government phone so I didn’t have bill but it was always breaking easy or getting cut off due to the people I sign up with scamming and signing up people with my info causing my phone getting cut off. I went through at least 30 of them phones. My Facebook was recently hacked and it had all of me and my wife memories and the birth of our son so I had to make a new one but hopefully soon I be able to get back into it so I don’t lose it. But long story short if anyone can help that would be greatly help just look up my
Name on facebook I recently made it but my original facebook page is Tone Bookman and you will see I’m not bullshitting or trying to scam people. I’m just trying to get by and don’t know what else to do and got to swallow my pride and reach out hoping someone can help or multiple people so I can get back on my feet and give my son the life he deserves and a better life and love that I never received which I’m doing now. Her family do the best they can they would send me 100 dollars at the end of the month when I ask but I try to not over do it I hit her stepfather around the 15-20 of the month so we can make it until the cash assistance hit on the second but truthfully it’s not enough. If I can get a car I can DoorDash and do much more and be able to keep us afloat. It’s much more I can go into about

loneliness,I feel like giving up ,"I've probably gone through CEN which has completely messed up my life. I'm 16 and from the age of 14 I've been experiencing intense loneliness  on and off depression  porn addiction. I've lost interest in everything  in every hobby of mine  studies and everything. I'm in 12th grade now and I'm not even studying! People say 12th grade is important for your career and college but I just don't the energy to study. I don't even have the energy to get out of my bed  to brush my teeth. 

I crave for love  someone to see me  understand me and appreciate me soooo much. I can't even explain. Sometimes I just spend nights crying just because of this and sleep around 4-5 am  waking up with swollen eyes. I have no friends I can turn to  my relationship with my parents is not good. They don't understand anything that I do  they don't appreciate me for the good things. They always keep talking about themselves  their likes  dislikes and just themselves. They don't even know who I am as a person. They don't know who their son is  his personality and all. 

My low self-esteem and perfectionism makes things even more harder. I don't find joy in my hobbies and interests anymore like playing guitar. Just holding guitar in my hands makes me tear up. Makes me feel heavy in my chest. My social skills are not good at all. I'm like an outcast in my high school with no friends. No one understands me  no one sees me. Why? Because I don't keep scrolling fucking instagram and play games all day like them. My personality is completely different from everyone maybe because of how I was raised. Just being alone in my head. Socializing is so hard for me  the fear of rejection and all  even my friends poke me that I'm an asshole I can't even be confident in front of them and all. I just can't explain how hard it is  spending all these years alone locked inside your home and then you imagine that when you'll get into teenage  everything will be alright but then you realise that everyone is so different from you and you don't have the skills  you've developed so many fears over all these years that it feels impossible. Loneliness is my main problem because it stems from my childhood and it feeds all the other. 

I've tried my best to control myself. Meditated for hours  journaled  tried a bunch of things out but nothing helps. Wish there was magic in this world so I could've felt better instantly. I'm still here and I haven't taken my life because I still believe someone will help me get through this. I don't think this belief is gonna last long. I've tried my best.",5,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1hkjatw/i_feel_like_giving_up/,feel like giving,ive probably gone cen completely messed life im 16 age 14 ive experiencing intense loneliness depression porn addiction ive lost interest everything every hobby mine study everything im 12th grade im even studying people say 12th grade important career college dont energy study dont even energy get bed brush teeth crave love someone see understand appreciate soooo much cant even explain sometimes spend night cry sleep around 45 waking swollen eye friend turn relationship parent good dont understand anything dont appreciate good thing always keep talking like dislike dont even know person dont know son personality low selfesteem perfectionism make thing even harder dont find joy hobby interest anymore like playing guitar holding guitar hand make tear make feel heavy chest social skill good im like outcast high school friend one understands one see dont keep scrolling fucking instagram play game day like personality completely different everyone maybe raised alone head socializing hard fear rejection even friend poke im asshole cant even confident front cant explain hard spending year alone locked inside home imagine youll get teenage everything alright realise everyone different dont skill youve developed many fear year feel impossible loneliness main problem stem childhood feed ive tried best control meditated hour journaled tried bunch thing nothing help wish magic world couldve felt better instantly im still havent taken life still believe someone help get dont think belief gon na last long ive tried best

loneliness,Therapy ,"I’ve tried it many many times  even been on medication for depression and it just doesn’t work for me. I think therapy just helps you accept your situation and doesn’t pretend to give you advice on how to overcome whatever is causing you pain. Accept loneliness  poverty  fatness  misery  death of someone  etc. I think for me what has sort of worked was just doing a lot of hobbies to get my mind off of my loneliness. Or working out a lot until I was too tired to notice how lonely I am. Therapy was just me crying on a couch on how pointless my life was and the therapist just listening or prescribing medication or making me journal (I’m not into writing or literature  sorry; do a lot of it at work  not about to do it on my free time). 
Some people have been judgmental towards me however  because this year  I’ve decided I’m going to voice my feelings and say I don’t believe in therapy and will die on this hill. So it’s all right for people to claim they are atheists for example  (I’m catholic and believe in god) and I’m supposed to be tolerant  but they can’t be tolerant towards me when I say I’m not going to therapy because I don’t believe in it. I’m not an addict  I’m very responsible in my job  I clean myself and maintain my house  I’m active and feed myself properly- I don’t need therapy or medication as I’m a functional adult. I don’t judge those who do believe they need it  but I’ve tried it and it doesn’t work for me; rather get a dopamine hit from sports  the gym  shopping  or getting payed well for my work.

loneliness,I want to die ,i usually don’t ask for help but i’m at my lowest it feels like. my grandma and grandpa both raised me and they both died in 2022. I was only 17 when my grandpa died and just turned 18 when my grandma died. i don’t talk to my younger siblings and my older siblings moved away. I was left with my aunt and she was a slob and it was horrible. I ended up moving out and my job has been cutting my hours and it’s just been hard. I was with a girl but it turned out she was with someone else the whole time and ofc she dropped me.  my whole life i have felt like a nobody. i’m just here because my mom had me. My soul feels so dead. I don’t find enjoyment in anything and I’m always mad and closed off. i want to meet new people but they always end up leaving me or treating me horrible. I’m always being replaced like nothing. i’m so useless in the world. I tried doing things to be gentle with myself and love myself but the pain just always takes over. I even got a cat and i almost still feel lonely. he kinda just adds to my stress. I smoke weed vape and smoke carts and it’s the only thing that gets me through the day. I know im addicted to it but it’s the only thing that can make me feel happy. I’m scared for my health because i do it so much. but no one seems to see how im dying inside. All of my friends left me because of how i am but i can’t help it. i mentally been so depressed and it’s so hard to hide it. i just distance myself so i wont be a burden because i know my sadness ruins everyone’s mood. I just hate myself and i wish i could be better. It just feels like every time i try to change im knocked back down and it hurts. i just need someone to be here it’s so hard being alone at 20. it’s almost like no one cares. i want to die ,8,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1f53vwj/i_want_to_die/,want die,usually dont ask help im lowest feel like grandma grandpa raised died 2022 17 grandpa died turned 18 grandma died dont talk younger sibling older sibling moved away left aunt slob horrible ended moving job cutting hour hard girl turned someone else whole time ofc dropped whole life felt like nobody im mom soul feel dead dont find enjoyment anything im always mad closed want meet new people always end leaving treating horrible im always replaced like nothing im useless world tried thing gentle love pain always take even got cat almost still feel lonely kinda add stress smoke weed vape smoke cart thing get day know im addicted thing make feel happy im scared health much one seems see im dying inside friend left cant help mentally depressed hard hide distance wont burden know sadness ruin everyones mood hate wish could better feel like every time try change im knocked back hurt need someone hard alone 20 almost like one care want die
loneliness,I want to help others like me...,"I've known existential loneliness for most of my life. I know how much pain it brings... Just wanting someone to be there for you. Hug you and tell you ""I'm here now  it will be ok"". So much of my life I wanted it  craved it  needed it.. So many nights crying alone  holding myself as I begged for someone to hold me.

The sadest part is I thought I deserved to be alone. I believed that no one could possibly care for me. So if anybody did try to show me any kind of care  I just pushed them away. I almost never saw it as genuine. This went on for most of my life. I had almost no social skills because of this.... I was so lost and alone. Words cannot describe...

But at some point things turned around... I Found somebody that did care for me. I started to believe that I did matter. I started to develop social skills. I even became that confident in the way I spoke....
In the last seven months  I've made tremendous growth in myself. Remove many addictions  lost a lot of weight  and really began to accept myself.

loneliness,I'm building an app to help address the loneliness epidemic. Would love your honest feedback!,"Hey everyone 

I’m a computer science and design master’s student who wants to make the world a little better. For the past few months  I’ve been working on an app idea  and I’d love to hear your thoughts.

I personally struggle with making friends and have mild social anxiety. It can be really rough some days. I’ve tried a bunch of social and friend-making apps  but I’ve never felt good about any of them.

**The idea is simple:**

Instead of focusing on dating-like profiles  awkward meetups  or curated dinners  this app gives you small social challenges to help you step outside your comfort zone in the real-world.

It meets you at your current social comfort levels and integrates challenges into your daily routine. For example:

* If you regularly go to cafes  take public transport  or go the gym but never actually talk to anyone  it might challenge you to give a genuine compliment  start a small conversation about a suggested topic  or even just say hi.
* The goal is to help you practice social skills in low-pressure situations for those who find it intimidating or challenging to talk to new people.
* It can also track your progress over time and see how different challenges and situations impact your nerves or feelings of loneliness.

My philosophy is this: If I can go about my everyday life being open  curious  and willing to interact with those around me  I can naturally find acquaintances  friends  best friends  opportunities  or partners. I know this because that's how I've generally met every person I've ever met before. Even if you never see them again  spontaneous interactions make daily life much more fun and interesting anyway.

I genuinely want to help  so I’d love to hear your honest thoughts and opinions. Would you find something like this actually useful? What sucks? What’s confusing? What’s missing?

loneliness,Help with loneliness,"Hello. I'm 37 years old and truly feel ready for life to finish. Everyday I experience loneliness and regardless of what I do I can never shake that feeling. For years  I had this belief that one day I would find love but after that delusion started fading away a couple of years ago  I've never been the same and slowly descending. That delusion kept my hopes up my whole life when I got my heart broken each time. I can get dates and even had relationships but I always went with women I truly didn't love in hopes that maybe that feeling would change. In the end  it didn't and both of us ended up feeling worse. It was a learning experience for me. Unfortunately I've never had a girl that I like  like me. I looked into a lot of self improvement and just being myself but no matter what I did  it truly felt like I was cursed. 

I exercise 3-4 days a week  go on frequent walks  tried making friends at work and social events  tried social and dating apps but nothings helped my mental health. I've even moved twice in the last 3 years in hopes that a new town would re-energize my life. When I finish work  I find myself sometimes just staring at my tv screen and walking around my house as I'm starting to lose my desire to enjoy the hobbies I used to enjoy. Most of my friends I still keep in touch with but they are often busy with their families.

loneliness,Dealing with loneliness,"I just recently turned 30 years old. I’ve never had a serious relationship  no matter how hard I tried. I’ve gone through the dating apps   friends of friends  everything  but I just can’t seem to click with anyone. 

Over the last 2 years  I have made some serious changes to my health. There is a post on my profile about it  but basically I went from drinking 40ish beers a week to occasionally 2 a week  if that. I have lost 60 lbs  I go to the gym to keep myself in the best shape I’ve ever been in  and I work construction. 

I did all of these changes for me  for my health  but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want a relationship out of it. I constantly seem to end up in the friend zone. I’m not particularly good at talking to girls  though I think I’m better now than I used to be. 

This all came to a head over the last couple weeks. I met a girl at my climbing gym and hit it off with her. We started climbing together a bunch  hung out for a bite to eat a few times  and I thought the vibes were great. She even told me that she was really looking forward to spending time with me. 

Last weekend  we went out for a chill night out together and again I thought we were hitting things off really well. I dropped her off at her place  said goodnight and made tentative plans to hang out during this past week. When I got home though  I got that dreaded text that I’ve gotten 1000 times before: “I just got out of a really toxic relationship  and as much as I like spending time with you  I’m not ready for that again yet”. 

I immediately felt all of that old self doubt slamming into me like a ton of bricks. I sent her a message saying I understood  and I hoped we could still spend time together as friends  seeing if maybe this could turn into something. She heart reacted that  and responded absolutely. I figured at least that’s a start. However  she has not responded to hardly any messages this week. The plan had been for me to help her move some furniture and other things this week  but each time I asked for a time to help her out  she came up with some reason why she couldn’t(they could be true  probably are  just feels like she’s avoiding me). 

All of this is just sparking all of my old self-doubt and depression. It sucks.

It’s worse because i have made memories with my old friends and my SO’s  but now they’re all gone and i’m grasping to the little that I had which is about years ago now. Its like i got a free trial and I cant access the full package now.

ive been battling depression and loneliness for around five years now  and Ive hit my lowest point now. I dont wanna be here anymore. I cant stand another day. i dont know how much i can say here  but ive been planning.

loneliness, cheating  suicide or kill thoughts,"I have been subjected to a financial as well as a professional cheating by my close relative which is consider myself as a brother. I worked for him and because of his words I spend 3 years with him. He told me I will be rewarded at the end. My salary was pending for 21 months and I haven't asked him because I knew him he was struggling. I wanted to end my job in his company after one year but he told me to stay for bit more and it lasted to e years. But at the end he only paid me salary of 15 months without any increment. Ath the same time till my birth my father ( who died before my birth) took all his money ( my father was soo rich at that time ). They stayed at my house in which the father build it for us. My father died just after 6 months of marriage with my mother. So she went back to her home. So I was taken care off my grandparents. But still my house and an another small property was their and the house. Obtaining area was multi owned owners including me my mom and  my father's parents as per shariah rule. But my father's father was not interested in sharing that property and we went to court but in a cinema style incident our advocate cheated us.
While I was studying in 5th standard my mother married another guy and she gone with him and I was fully taken care of my mother's parents. But I heard they saying their inability to take care of me kid every day ( but they have done their duty well especially my grandmother) . In my childhood I was a pro introvert and I don't have much friends too. My plus 2 life gave me a new charactor. But after that I never had any new friends or others. I never had any girlfriends. Once I had a crush on collage   but all my so called friends where supporting a senior guy who also had crush on her. So I decided to stay away from relationships because I know I won't be having any such things and I know nobody will be loving me. 
Since then most of the time I speak with trees or some non living beings or even myself. After college I started earning and then my relative guy came to my life. 
Also on last month I bought the property ownership of my father's relatives and I wanted to sell my land and start a new career.But still they block the sale of the land and they never wanted me to be a success man. 
I never misbehaved with any of the people or i somehow wanted to be nice with everyone. But no one loves me back or even some people even without any reason wanted me to get hurt. Now I am getting the suicide thoughts or like some one is murnering to kill the guys who cheat me or to commit suicide and escape from the world. Right now I don't have any job  no gf  no home   no money and nothing . 
I donno what to do

like yeah ive had many many factors in my life that led me to where i am today like my long history of being abused by other people  but the person i spoke to told me that my worth isnt defined by how people treat me...and dude. when i read that. i cried. i looked in the mirror and i fucking cried. i needed to hear that so badly its insane. 



i also learned that its okay to exist...im not a very productive person most of the time and i often beat myself up for that  but   its okay to just exist. even if im not employed right now...my dad will still love me and wont abandon me. especially since hes spent most of his life fighting custody for me

loneliness,Thoughts of non-existence and suicide within the context of loneliness,"I have realized that  when alone  but when im not fully isolated  such as when i have goone to clasroom or some friend has talked to me that day  I will most of the times end up with the track of thought of ""phisical non-existence would be better""  sometimes with and sometimes without the suicidal tone that is normaly added to that sentence.

Should this fact be contrasted by itself  it may seem like textbook depresion  which it's why these other 2 facts seem so fascinating to me.

The first   that when with those persons  I most of the time feel good  not great by itself  but definitely not suicidal. 

Yet when I have not contacted with anyone for a few days  like it's common with my semiperiodic self isolation phases  I feel okay. Not great  not even good  but I definitely feel better than a few hours after the ""social contact"" itself.

I think that this may be due to that when I'm with someone I realize all I'm missing in a social life  such as friends and people who love me  which  come the time I am finally alone and the ""social feromones"" have gone down  I realize my life is shit.

I've come to say to myself ""I hope it gets better or worse""  in the meaning that having someone to be with as myself and love is good  absolute loneliness does seem bad  but the middle point  when I'm lonely but not lonely enough to be ignorant of my loneliness is hell in my own bedroom.

loneliness,Can't make it on my own any longer,"My (41 F) life in a nutshell:

I grew up in a dysfunctional family with physical and mental abuse. Was bullied at school. Started drinking and taking drugs as a teenager.

In my mid-twenties  I found a spiritual community that helped me out of that lifestyle and a few years later  I left my home country and moved to a place where this community is more active. Lost contact with all of my old friends.

Have always been struggling to fit into society  dropped out of university and got a job but burnt out in my early 30's. Was diagnosed with autism and adhd around that time. Also ended up homeless  was moving around a lot between 2014 and 2018 with no place to rest while also suffering from major depression and serious fatigue. Got no support from my family  they only carried on with mental abuse so I cut off ties with them.

Got disability pension 2018 at the age of 35. Found a decent place to live but also isolated myself totally since then. Was also in a destructive relationship  ended it in late 2019 since he threatened to beat me up and kill me. Then pandemic happened and I got even more isolated.

Left the spiritual community last year since I found out they're a cult; got no real support from them whatsoever  they just manipulated me into thinking that all negative things happening to me are my own fault and result of my past actions  and there was nothing I could do about it and that I was on my own. Got contact with some cult survivor groups and made close friends with one person online. Soon we developed romantic feelings to each other and since a couple of months or so we've been in a long distance relationship. He's been my everything since then but just like me  he suffers from ptsd and has since 10 days or so behaved very weirdly. Isolated from the rest of the world  hardly responding to my messages and when he does  it takes nearly one day or so.

I think I'm having a mental breakdown  I'm nearly suicidal. What's the point of going on with life? It's only been a series of tragedies and I seem to make terrible mistakes all the time. Have zero friends I can rely on and I'm too broken to make it on my own. Thought that me and my boyfriend (or maybe I should consider myself single at this point?) would have supported each other and start a new life together but it seems he's not on the same page anymore. I just can't cope with him disappearing  not giving me any kind of validation or showing any signs that he wants to communicate with me and sort things out. So on top of all this  my heart's also broken now.

After a life like this  how can I carry on without family or friends or anyone to rely on? I just want to give up",1,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1jmo7da/cant_make_it_on_my_own_any_longer/,cant make longer,41 f life nutshell grew dysfunctional family physical mental abuse bullied school started drinking taking drug teenager midtwenties found spiritual community helped lifestyle year later left home country moved place community active lost contact old friend always struggling fit society dropped university got job burnt early 30 diagnosed autism adhd around time also ended homeless moving around lot 2014 2018 place rest also suffering major depression serious fatigue got support family carried mental abuse cut tie got disability pension 2018 age 35 found decent place live also isolated totally since also destructive relationship ended late 2019 since threatened beat kill pandemic happened got even isolated left spiritual community last year since found theyre cult got real support whatsoever manipulated thinking negative thing happening fault result past action nothing could got contact cult survivor group made close friend one person online soon developed romantic feeling since couple month weve long distance relationship he everything since like suffers ptsd since 10 day behaved weirdly isolated rest world hardly responding message take nearly one day think im mental breakdown im nearly suicidal whats point going life series tragedy seem make terrible mistake time zero friend rely im broken make thought boyfriend maybe consider single point would supported start new life together seems he page anymore cant cope disappearing giving kind validation showing sign want communicate sort thing top heart also broken life like carry without family friend anyone rely want give

loneliness,I hate my life and want to end it,"Idk why I am typing this... just created this account because I am this desperate for help. 

Everything in my life is shit. I just don't know what to do anymore.. I feel like killing myself..
I can't even stick to my workout schedule because I am this suicidal.. I hate eating. It's the same shit everyday and also exhausting. The fact that I am human also disgusts me in a way. I am just ashamed of myself.. I have noone. My dad died last year.. my birthgiver on the other hand who I live with is an abuse piece of ... (not gonna call names although I would want to say so much bad shit about this person.. ugh feel like vomiting)... literally traumatized by her. I believe that she is a narcissist. 

Anyways.. regardless of that I can't find to seem joy in life anymore. Everything is draining me. Feel like a piece of fat shit and am afraid of loosing my muscles that I have built. I have already not been active at all for about 2 weeks I believe and I just hate this feeling of loosing my strenght  rusting and becoming weaker and weaker.. 

I did watch lots of movies the past week being in another depressive episode again  which I am still in..  and watching some funny videos here and there laughing but I am still being tormented in my insides by everything that has happened to me and the pain I am feeling..
I genuinely don't know if I can keep existing anymore. I have no energy to make new friendships.. I am scared of people.. scared of abuse or being threatened and treated like garbage.

The fact that I also crave love and compassion AND on top of all of that am a fuckin human being is so disgusting to me. I just want to vanish and have never existed in the first place. My birthgiver should have just gotten an abortion and that would've been best for me and probably for her too. I hate the fact that I am saying this but man I am hurt.

Noone wants me or needs me. Makes no difference if I am not here anymore. I do have my uncle (my dads brother) and a good friend of mine but man I ultimately don't give a shit if they suffer if I really decide to kill myself.. this is my life and I can do whatever the fuck I want. Why am I even here?! I just want this knife sticking through my chest to be gone. I can't live with it like this anymore. 

On top of that I can't seem to find a job.. been only getting rejections and my money is running out..
Luckily from tomorrow on I'll partially be in a psych ward... hope this will help but I still feel so lost. I don't know if it'll make a difference. After my 1 to 2 month stay there I will have to have a job and man I just don't think I can do it. If I just were financially secure and had a loving home (instead of a sick toxic place) things would be so much better for me.. 

I hate being an adult.. I just feel like a lost small boy.. no matter how old my body is my spirit will always be a small young boy running wild in his dreams..

Idk Idk Idk...

Idk man.. I am really lost here. Whatever.. 
I am just lost.. forever..

Edit: So it seems that it'll take a little longer until I can go to the psych ward. Hopefully no later than a week but it's also not promised so yeah.. this is not good.

loneliness,Asking for help // does anyone relate  can I get better?,"I think I was born without the primal feeling that makes you care about your own survival. Everything I do feels superficial. For years I have isolated myself. I've always said I wanted to run away but I know if I was anywhere by myself i would be self neglectful. If left alone without responsabilities  with all the money in the world and no one to be responsible for other than myself  I wouldn't bother making myself food  getting out of bed or trying to do anything with my money. I have never been able to visualise my future  I've felt like I was meant to die young but it hasn't happened yet or something. I'm not actively suicidal or anything. I feel guilty  I have a home  loving parents  longtime friends  I have a job and an education. I know I am priviledged so why doesn't that matter to me. An old friend of mine passed away recently  two days before he moved to another country. I think about it everyday with guilt  he had a plan and potential and worth. He truly deserved to get a fresh start. Why am I the one that lives. I am grateful for what I have but It feels unappreciated. I know there is people I can talk to but I feel alone. For the last few years even at my happiest I've always felt it in the back of my mind. I don't feel worthy of life. Nothing extremely traumatic has happened to me  I have no reason for this. I like my appearance  I have hobbies but it's all superficial. I don't hate myself either it's about my instincts why don't I put myself first.
If I was given the chance I'd let myself rot to death. I look around and everyone has moved on  I've felt like this for years  I don't understand why I don't care for myself  why I don't have that survival instinct. I can't even say I gave up on myself cos I don't think I was ever there. If someone tried to kill me  adrenaline aside  I don't think id run  truly I feel like I deserve it. I know I'm wasting my life why don't I care to fix it. I'm constantly asking for a sign that I'm worthy or that there is a plan for me but I know that at the end it's not real and the only person that can fix this is me. I feel like a curse on those around me and I realise I am the problem but I don't know how to ask for help. I know this is stupid but do you believe in cursed souls like genuinely is there something wrong with me.

loneliness,What can I do,"I’m a 21-year-old female  the youngest of eight siblings  but I genuinely believe I’m the most unlovable  loneliest person who has ever lived. Appearance-wise  I’m below average—I’ve been made aware of this since elementary school. When my brother and I would play house with friends or cousins  the only person who wanted to be paired with me was my brother  which led to other issues I don’t need to get into.
As the youngest  my siblings were all too grown and independent to be close to our extended family  so it was just my siblings and me. Most of them have had issues with each other and aren’t on speaking terms  so I mainly grew up with my sister  who is six years older than me. You could say she raised me.
Although I really enjoyed people’s company  they didn’t feel the same way. I had very few friends  and I always felt like I was forcing myself on them or that they secretly hated me. I spent most of my school breaks walking around alone  in the bathroom  or sitting in the classroom with my head on the table  just waiting for the day to be over.
I had one friendship during middle school that keeps me together. Even though she preferred to hang out with her other friends during breaks  she was kind enough to love me for the rest of the day and chose to stay in classes with me instead of going with them.
When my sister—the one who raised me due to my incompetent mother—graduated  she went into a depressive episode and wouldn’t leave her room. Although I deeply sympathized with her  I couldn’t help but think she was selfish for leaving me alone when she knew she was all I had. Then  she found something silly I had said on the internet that she believed was “disrespectful to God” and told me not to speak to her because of it. Her reaction was extreme  but I still stopped talking to her for the entire two years she stayed in her room. Even after she came out  we never returned to the way we were.
During those two years  I went through one of the most transitional periods of my life—I got into university. I didn’t make friends  always felt awkward and out of place  and no one spoke to me  but it was still miles better than school.
My brothers have children  and I was happy because I thought  Finally  someone who isn’t years older than me that I can befriend. But that didn’t happen. Sometimes they were nice  and I felt extremely happy and full of love because I have so much to give. But then  other times  they weren’t  and I could feel how uncomfortable they were around me. They would say some of the meanest things I’ve ever heard.
Once  I was chatting with one of my sisters  and she kept talking about how “ugly” one of our cousins was—while describing me. Another time  she came into my room and accused me of being jealous of her. When I had bangs  she laughed at me for “attempting to be pretty.” Over time  I realized she just hated me  so I stopped speaking to her completely.
My mom also hates me  but she has always been a horrible mother to all my siblings. She constantly compares me to my father  saying I’m evil. She blames me for everything bad that happens. She calls me greedy. She pushed me when I refused to lie to my father like she wanted me to. She starts problems and then plays the victim.
My dad and I were never really close—he’s just there.
I’m still in university  and I’ve made some friends  but the relationships feel purely transactional. They only text when they need something. Most of the time  everyone is just trying to get rid of me so they can be with their real friends. I feel forgettable. I’ll participate in something with an instructor  and they’ll name everyone who was involved—except me.
In every classroom  I’m at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Even with the group of “friends” I have  I’m always the ugliest one  the one left out. When I’m around people  they constantly get complimented while I just stand there  unnoticed. Everyone I interact with seems to have something negative to say about me—to my face.
My family hates me. I have no real friends. Every comment I’ve ever received about my appearance in 21 years has been negative. No one has ever complimented me. No guy has ever looked at me. No one has ever wanted to befriend me.
I’m not very smart. I’ve struggled with my body for as long as I can remember.
I don’t see myself killing myself  but I also don’t understand what’s keeping me going. I spend most  if not all  of my days in my room—not because I enjoy it  but because there’s nowhere else for me to be.
Does anyone know what is going on or what can I do LOL?",3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1ivssrt/what_can_i_do/,,im 21yearold female youngest eight sibling genuinely believe im unlovable loneliest person ever lived appearancewise im averageive made aware since elementary school brother would play house friend cousin person wanted paired brother led issue dont need get youngest sibling grown independent close extended family sibling issue arent speaking term mainly grew sister six year older could say raised although really enjoyed people company didnt feel way friend always felt like forcing secretly hated spent school break walking around alone bathroom sitting classroom head table waiting day one friendship middle school keep together even though preferred hang friend break kind enough love rest day chose stay class instead going sisterthe one raised due incompetent mothergraduated went depressive episode wouldnt leave room although deeply sympathized couldnt help think selfish leaving alone knew found something silly said internet believed disrespectful god told speak reaction extreme still stopped talking entire two year stayed room even came never returned way two year went one transitional period lifei got university didnt make friend always felt awkward place one spoke still mile better school brother child happy thought finally someone isnt year older befriend didnt happen sometimes nice felt extremely happy full love much give time werent could feel uncomfortable around would say meanest thing ive ever heard chatting one sister kept talking ugly one cousin waswhile describing another time came room accused jealous bang laughed attempting pretty time realized hated stopped speaking completely mom also hate always horrible mother sibling constantly compare father saying im evil blame everything bad happens call greedy pushed refused lie father like wanted start problem play victim dad never really closehes im still university ive made friend relationship feel purely transactional text need something time everyone trying get rid real friend feel forgettable ill participate something instructor theyll name everyone involvedexcept every classroom im bottom social hierarchy even group friend im always ugliest one one left im around people constantly get complimented stand unnoticed everyone interact seems something negative say meto face family hate real friend every comment ive ever received appearance 21 year negative one ever complimented guy ever looked one ever wanted befriend im smart ive struggled body long remember dont see killing also dont understand whats keeping going spend day roomnot enjoy there nowhere else anyone know going lol
loneliness,39M I’ve never felt more alone ,"
I'm 39  and  I am in exact same situation -- never had a girlfriend  had sex  never even kissing a girl. I'd be happy to give some insight straight from the horse's mouth. from time to time  and if you're in the know and can identify with a certain lived experience  it's easy to observe when someone is on the spectrum. I've always gleaned that from peoples mannerisms  my obsessive interests (video games and classic rock)  and my way of speaking (tone of voice  tendency to overenunciate words) that i have an autism spectrum disorder -- possibly diagnosed. Having autism is more than enough to render yourself as women-repellant just by sheer virtue of existing  without the upbringings that most autistic men have to suffer from. And even though a lot of what Bo is saying here are conjectures  his predictions on a lot of points I would say are pretty spot on. I could talk forever about the upbringing that got me here  but I'll try to distill it into a few essential cliff points: I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome when I was 13 years old when my grandparents noticed I couldn't make eye contact with people and had sensory processing issues that kept me from eating  as I would throw virtually everything I was fed right back up. My mother was the dominant parent in my household -- my dad wasn't around  but always seemed more interested in doing drugs. He was in and out of prison my whole childhood and then finally 3 years ago broke into my apartment and stole from me. than spending any quality time with me or the rest of my family. He was a negligent parent and bordered on abusive at times.He messed up the chance when I was 14 to have a stepmom yet again because of his drug problems. I had no other key male figures in my life except my grandfather  and had no brothers or male cousins (at least ones that were my age and lived close to me) -- I am an only child and all of my close cousins were female. I found sports boring as a kid  which made it hard to relate to my father and other boys at school. This plus the autism led to me being bullied pretty much my entire life going through school. I was also precocious as a child  known for being more developed in the intellectual/cognitive side of things than other kids my age. I always read/wrote several grades higher than my grade level. This caused teachers (and older people in general) to take bigger notice of me than the other kids  which meant I was watched like a hawk constantly and couldn't take the risks and missteps that other boys my age could get away with. I would be punished  called out  and reprimanded for doing way less than other boys  and this was a pattern that continued well into adulthood. This doesn't even begin to go into my history with girls. I never even had to ask out girls in school to become aware of my low value -- it was always something that other kids would bring up on their own accord and situations that I would be pulled into by them that reinforced that fact. I never started trying to date until university and even then  it was only a few half-hearted attempts here and there. Nowadays  I can give off a positive impression and seem to do ""okay"". I've haven't wanted to go to the gym because i don't want to see all the happy couples with their normie happiness shoved in my face because i have seen this pain in my face for 6 years working in retail let me tell you it hurt so bad everyday i would get up for work i would feel so drained to have to endure that pain daily to have to interact with the general public seeing something i will never have again is like dying a thousand deaths. I am bald now i miss my hair but it is what it is. I grow a beard or goatee even now that I'm almost 40. I am currently working a job in security making decent money and living on my own with totally alone -- though I am at a kind of crossroads point in my career where I will have to to betterr myself and work my way up in my current company which i have never been given the chance in my entire life up until now.if I want to stay healthy. It is a data centerr security job that is very easy and when i worked in retail was very taxing on my mental and physical health  so I probably won't stay ""attractive"" for long if I continue to work this job. So I'm now finally at a point where I could date and have some success if I was willing to put myself out there.... And I don't. Why? Because I just don't care enough to. My upbringing has completely killed my spirit  and I am finding myself at a point where I'm just finding it so hard to want to try. Throughout the entirety of my life  I've been made to feel as if the realm of sex  and dating  and relationships was a parallel society that I was never allowed to be a part of. It's almost a universal experience where the periods of middle school and high school and college are permitted as this period of discovery where people have their first experiences really gauging their worth in that arena  being attractive and being sexy and being charismatic and getting to share themselves with the opposite sex in an environment and consciousness that's carefree with little strings of attached. I never got to have that throughout that point in my life. That affirmation only came afterwards  as I got into my 20s i had made a mistake by meeting all the wrong women and even had a child with the wrong woman which i was never ready to be a father my daughter which is now 13 i haven't seen her in 7 years since by grandmother passed away and my last relationship was about to be on the rocks because my ex blamed me for not working even though she set the trap of telling me to not to work for 3 summers in a row and as a love sick fool i fell for it and it ultimately was my own down fall and fault being so emotional invested into someone who didn't return the feelings i had for them. and all of my peers had already built their confidence and success in that area. It makes me feel like I'm living a lie  where the lessons that I have had to learn from my upbringing were never real. And to me  that isn't fair. I feel so ashamed for not being able to develop in that way at a normal timeframe  at the same time that most people get to discover themselves and flourish. It wouldn't feel right for me to start now; it would all just feel like a big cope. Especially given that most days  it's hard to even just get up in the morning. I am so dead inside. After all  back in high school  the prospect of me even being seen with a girl was so ridiculous and offensive to people that even asking a girl out was out of the question. I don't deserve it. I'm not entitled to it. I was never owed it like all my peers were. I was disgusted. I was a creep. And when I'm made to feel that way without doing anything to anybody  I don't tend to take it lightly. I have a very hard time letting things go  and ultimately that is what has to change if I want to stop rotting in this situation. No amount of money  or gym  or confidence will fix that. I need serious help.

loneliness, cheating  suicide or kill thoughts,"I have been subjected to a financial as well as a professional cheating by my close relative which is consider myself as a brother. I worked for him and because of his words I spend 3 years with him. He told me I will be rewarded at the end. My salary was pending for 21 months and I haven't asked him because I knew him he was struggling. I wanted to end my job in his company after one year but he told me to stay for bit more and it lasted to e years. But at the end he only paid me salary of 15 months without any increment. Ath the same time till my birth my father ( who died before my birth) took all his money ( my father was soo rich at that time ). They stayed at my house in which the father build it for us. My father died just after 6 months of marriage with my mother. So she went back to her home. So I was taken care off my grandparents. But still my house and an another small property was their and the house. Obtaining area was multi owned owners including me my mom and  my father's parents as per shariah rule. But my father's father was not interested in sharing that property and we went to court but in a cinema style incident our advocate cheated us.
While I was studying in 5th standard my mother married another guy and she gone with him and I was fully taken care of my mother's parents. But I heard they saying their inability to take care of me kid every day ( but they have done their duty well especially my grandmother) . In my childhood I was a pro introvert and I don't have much friends too. My plus 2 life gave me a new charactor. But after that I never had any new friends or others. I never had any girlfriends. Once I had a crush on collage   but all my so called friends where supporting a senior guy who also had crush on her. So I decided to stay away from relationships because I know I won't be having any such things and I know nobody will be loving me. 
Since then most of the time I speak with trees or some non living beings or even myself. After college I started earning and then my relative guy came to my life. 
Also on last month I bought the property ownership of my father's relatives and I wanted to sell my land and start a new career.But still they block the sale of the land and they never wanted me to be a success man. 
I never misbehaved with any of the people or i somehow wanted to be nice with everyone. But no one loves me back or even some people even without any reason wanted me to get hurt. Now I am getting the suicide thoughts or like some one is murnering to kill the guys who cheat me or to commit suicide and escape from the world. Right now I don't have any job  no gf  no home   no money and nothing . 
I donno what to do
