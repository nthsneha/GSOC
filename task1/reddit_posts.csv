depression,I don't get how other people aren't suicidal,I'm in therapy  I'm taking medications and I still think almost daily about suicide. Nothing makes me feel happy and my life feels meaningless.I made friends because I thought beign lonely made me suicidal  I made plans for the future so I can have something to look forward to  I clean my room and go outside because it's good for me but nothing is ever enough. I asked my therapist why he wants to be alive  but nothing he told me seemed so fulfilling that it makes sense to keep going. I don't understand why most people don't want to die when life objectively sucks so much,944,174,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1g48c9t/i_dont_get_how_other_people_arent_suicidal/

depression,Not suicidal but I wouldn’t mind not waking up tomorrow,I’m not suicidal. I have a good life  by the standards of what a good life is I suppose. Good family  good friends  good country  good future ahead of me. It makes me feel worse about the feelings I’ve been having lately. I’ve been thinking about death  about the many  many more years I might continue living and growing on this planet  the good and the bad I will experience and wonder if any of it’s actually worth it. I look at the world and the more I do so the more it all becomes so intensely insane and draining to me. I mean what is any of this anyway? What am I? I’ve tried finding meaning through various philosophical perspectives but ultimately cant find an acceptable solution to this maddening reality  it’s all just anyone’s best guess as to what it’s all about. Most nights I consider the possibility that I might not wake up the next morning  and a strange feeling of comfort comes over me  I think I would welcome death in a way like that. To finally be free in sweet oblivion. To let go. Again  I am not suicidal I don’t want to kill myself  but if something beyond my control came to take me  I think I’d be happy to go. ,577,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1j9j2ky/not_suicidal_but_i_wouldnt_mind_not_waking_up/
depression,"My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. My family is saying I will ""ruin Christmas"" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do?","A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support  she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened  it left me deeply depressed  particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate  I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them  but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. 

I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone  I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother  even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However  their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any ""normal"" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice  I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down  or even by coming down just for dinner  that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments  implying I would be at fault for them. 

Here's the breakdown:  with my family  I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However  I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family  while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact  they've dismissed it as me ""not having enough social activity""  as ""not having enough will""  and have called my therapy ""a waste of time."" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do  I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's  but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition. 

Any and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you.",2389,376,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eczhm3/my_friend_attempted_suicide_a_couple_days_ago_my/

depression,Everyone says if you're depressed  don't be afraid to reach out and ask for support...,Well  we try to. And guess what? No one cares. Everyone is busy with their own lives and problems. They don't want to hear about how you're severely depressed and think about killing yourself every day. It makes them uncomfortable. So in your hopes to receive some sort of support or connection  you just end up pushing people away  which makes you even more isolated and depressed.

My coworkers like me  and some look up to me. No one would think I have any problems at all. However  I feel like I am hidden behind a veil  and when I come home from work and when I am in the privacy of my home  I am in such crippling depression. I have such terrible episodes of sadness. I hate myself. I over-analyze everything stupid I do or say throughout the day and I replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself. I don't feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely don't know why anyone even likes me. And yet I still get up every day  live this routine  and put on a facade like I am okay.

I know that my parents will just say that depression and suicidal thoughts are just common and focus on my grade and GPA. I feel hopeless. I want to know where to take my  life from. No comfort or support will help me much. I feel like I’m better off gone than having to work more and study and prepare for school and the SAT. To me that is all there is to life.

Thank you for all the memories and support you have me for the past seventeen years of my life. The times when you scolded me that if I didn’t get a good SAT score  then I would be sent to academies and my dog would be sent back to its previous home.

depression,my pain (25F) is overwhelming: i've been quarantining in an abusive household for the last year and am in need of some kind words,"i've been struggling a lot this week. my mental health has always been shit but lately  it's just gotten worse. i recently fired my therapist because my insurance changed and she wasn't accepting the new provider (she wasn't a good fit for me either  but something is better than nothing). so aside from my boyfriend and a few friends  i don't have anyone i can rely on. i feel bad venting to the people around me because they're all going through tough times too and it just doesn't feel fair for me to unload on them. so i hope that opening up to this sub is the right idea  even though i still feel guilty expressing my pain.

the heart of it all is that i have C-PTSD (along with other psych disorders) and these past few weeks I've been drifting in and out of disassociation  flashbacks  and episodes of crying fits. i can't stop reliving my trauma and am having a tough time with positive self-talk. right now i'd say my self-worth and self-esteem are at a 0. it doesn't help that i live in an abusive household but unfortunately i don't have anywhere else to go  and this is something I've dealt with my whole life. my mother is neglectful and my father is emotionally  verbally  and sometimes physically abusive. he picked a fight with me this morning for no reason and it set me over the edge. so between the flashbacks  disassociation  and deeply painful depression  i just feel so unsafe in my house. if my parents see me crying  they'll either gaslight or bully me. i just wish things were different. i don't really know where i'm going with this post other than it would be nice to be reminded that not everyone is mean and nasty. that i am a good person and i deserve a good life. i just want to stop crying.

It's something that's been happening to me since I was little. I remember wanting to kill myself and even preparing to do it when I was caught skipping school when I was 13. I was ready to do it. Only reason I didn't get to go ahead with it was because I was seen walking on the streets by someone I knew and they took me home. 

Fast forward to today. My mental state was quite stable and i was okay until I had a triggering conversation with my dad where he called me stupid and that set me off. Now I'm consumed by suicidal thoughts just from that one conversation. I know it will pass eventually but this seems to be quite a common reaction for my mind to have after an upsetting event.

She’s also gained a considerable amount of weight and she lost her job.  She is highly educated and accomplished.

She has been saying that she wishes she would go to sleep and not wake up. Earlier this year if she had suicidal ideation. 

Everyday my parents worry about her and call me. I don’t know what to do. It’s like she’s stuck in her mind and she doesn’t focus on her mental wellness at all. I’m lost.

depression,HELP ME 😭 depression  drug addiction  toxic relationship and being evicted 😭,my boyfriend and I are being evicted and can't deal with it it's like we are in denial  we need to  be out in a few days and we haven't even started packing. we are both drug addicts and hoarders so the place looks worse than usual. we have barricaded ourself in one small section of our place that is clean and habitable and can't deal with what we see and what this place looks like outside our barricade. everyone thinks and expects us to be packed and ready to move when in reality you  can hardly move around in here and all we are doing is sleeping  doing drugs and being depressed and crying. I'm so scared. it's so overwhelming and we don't know how to deal with it. on top of that my boyfriend and I have major issues and fight A LOT to the point where it gets physical. we are so toxic but still love each other to death. and hate each other to death. he just wants sex all the time to feel close to me and wanted and to get rid of frustration (that's all that helps him) but I'm too depressed and down most of the time to even want to talk nevermind have sex... so I get put in this fucked up situation where I end up having sex with him regardless of how I feel - and then end up feeling worse - just for him to fight with me about something else a few minutes after..... i don't know what to do anymore or even where to look... im sure being dead would be easier than this  but I would feel to bad leaving my family who loves me behind  incase they blame themselves or think they did something wrong when  raising me which is not the case - they are and have been perfect. I need help with the guilt  the being afraid of what's to come.... i just need a way OUT 😭 I don't want to feel like this anymore or be  so CRIPPLED by depression unable to do ANYTHING 😭,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ezk703/help_me_depression_drug_addiction_toxic/
depression,Guys I need HELP. Addicted to sadness?,"Please help. I have sought many psychotherapists  been on depression meds  mixtures  combos. DOne counselling  therapy  psychiatrist visits  medical trials. affirmations  rebirthing ( helped the most). 

Please read carefully. I do need help  I want some great insight or a word or a line to shake me out of this. 

I am constantly depressed and seem to have a ""go-to"" of misery and fear and sadness. It's almost like a comfort zone. Yet it is soo uncomfortable. It is not comforting at all. It is so exhausting  so brought and bitter and angry. I just feel angry. 

I say affirmations and I MEAN them. I do not victimize myself. No-one but me is the creator of my thoughts and I know this. It's nobody else doing ""bad"" things  or ""his/her fault"". It's me and I'm not a victim. 

It's as if I am afraid to be happy. I wrote ""Dare to be Happy"" on my mantras list  and it's usually the one that sets me off crying. I've been crying for 18 months now. I've had periods of huge black depression. Which is situation depression. 

I am not a depressive type. THis mood I think  is due to being unemployed. 

But the thing is  I am PERFECTLY qualified for the job I know I'm good at. I know I'm good at it. I'm truly not delusional. I'm talented enough  good enough and likeable and humble and helpful to the team enough. 

The times I've had that job  I'm super happy  and people love me. I like people and they like me. 

Yet each time  when the job is a contract ( my work always is)  I have this inside feeling that  once the contract is over  I'll have to hide and get under the blankets and escape the black cloud on the horizon. It's a weird feeling that I've talked to  and addressed and see the silliness of. = ""THat's silly now  you end the contract  have a few days off  the sun is shining  take a break  have some friends around  then you'll get another job!"".

And I truly KNOW this and mean it  and here I am. Unemplooyed  again  and I had a contract job for 2 months   then another one before that 5 years ago for 8 months. Etc. Each time  I LOVE the job  I wish it to continue  maybe they'll ask me to stay! Maybe it'll get extended. Etc.



Other people IN THIS TOWN  have a house  a car  a job - the job I wish for  and friends to fill the in between. They understand that sometimes in between contracts you have a week or two off. THey go visit friends  they have a hobby  etc. They're OK. 

It's as if I'm secretly afraid to just be happy  and this has led me to being constantly unemployed in a place where there is SO MUCH WORK  and I'm genuinely applying for 2-3 jobs a week. These applications get a ""no"" response. I don't expect all of the Yes's  of course. 

But my point is - I believe my inner voice is saying ""Don't be happy  it's not safe to be happy  what if you get that most amazing thing and then it'll get taken away and you'll die"". 

I now this is STUPID. I know childhood trauma can set a pattern. I do step work  talk myself out of things  give myself rationalizing on each of these ""monster in the cupboard"" type thoughts. I do believe it comes from a terrible and utterly shocking childhood trauma  which I won't go into. But I have addressed this each and every time. I understand the initial childhood shock that could lead me to be permanently stuck in this repurcussion. And I've done so much work on that part   in case THIS is the reason why. 

I am ALIVE  I am HAPY  I deserve to be HAPPY  just for today. ANd tonight. I can be happy tomorrow  that's great too!



But nothing shifts it. Even when I sing these affirmations and dance to them. Nothing so far. To make me into a normal grown up person-with-a-normal-job. A person with a house and a car. I am just so fucking sad. 

I believe this filter in me  is making the entire life I am experiencing and i just want so so much  to have a happy filter that sticks. Because right now  I shout  sing  scream  and push myself  laugh myself into a a happy zone  and as soon as I fall aslepp that day  it shifts into misery and sadness again. 

  
Please please help. I am so sad and I want to hear a line  or a word  or have something SHOCK me into having a change of perspective. I deserve the whole life of good things that I see in my vision and feel in my heart. I deserve and am worth ALL the good. 

SO why am I sitting her screaming into a pillow?

  
The job isn't that hard to get. Without this work that I enjoy  I have no life. 

I enjoy life. I like being happy. 

  
Please please help. ",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1dbiljy/guys_i_need_help_addicted_to_sadness/

depression,Help with depression/addiction,3 years ago I went willingly to rehab. I lost my home  husband  career but when I got out my son chose me. I was so happy I didn’t care I lost everything because I had him. I live with my parents and am on disability. The past several months my son graduated and has his own life. I stay up all night  sleep all day  have no motivation  watch TV  have no energy to do anything and no friends to do it with. Before now I was happy being single  friendless  career less  living with my parents because I had my son and all his activities and my life revolved around him. I didn’t need anything else. Now I am so depressed. I want to have friends  go back to work and have a life. I’m afraid to go back to work  can’t work and lose my disability. I got my doctor to put me back on Adderall. I began drugs with Adderall and went to meth. I was diagnosed with skitzophrenia  depression  anxiety about 5 years ago. So four months ago I thought if I got my Adderall I can take it correctly and maybe it will help with my motivation which I got dishonestly years back but now have symptoms of ADD. Script lasts a week and I’m productive person I want to be then I’m back in the bed for 3 weeks. I am not taking it correctly and I know I’m heading back into addiction. I need help with learning how to get motivated  not be a loser and BE HAPPY!! I feel worthless but I am productive and happy when I take Adderall (abuse it) but I don’t want that life. I need help being happy and productive again. I can’t afford therapy and I know I need to stop the Adderall. Each month I say I’m going to try and take it right this time and I don’t. Is there something out there that is anything like Adderall for motivation  focus  depression  memory that isn’t going to temp me to abuse it that works.

depression,"My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. My family is saying I will ""ruin Christmas"" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do?","A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support  she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened  it left me deeply depressed  particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate  I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them  but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. 

I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone  I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother  even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However  their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any ""normal"" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice  I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down  or even by coming down just for dinner  that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments  implying I would be at fault for them. 

Here's the breakdown:  with my family  I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However  I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family  while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact  they've dismissed it as me ""not having enough social activity""  as ""not having enough will""  and have called my therapy ""a waste of time."" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do  I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's  but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition.

25F

I am so sick of this life. Like literal life. I am a Christian so I believe in God and positive thinking but I'm literally giving all this shit up. 

I wanted to kill myself at 18 but somehow ended up at college. I graduated in 2020 so that tells you everything you need to know. I didn’t think I would make it past 18 so being here now is like what the fuck.

God isn't doing anything in my life. My positive thoughts aren't materializing. I don't even feel connection to the shit I believe in and am wishing for. My mind is literally turned off. I made muliple vision boards  read affirmations everyday  and do all the shit you're suppose to do. I can't do it anymore. 

I've been praying for a job that I can start and get into and that will pay me all the money I need and more. I've been battling unemployment and under paying jobs for damn a year and some change. I am beyond that. 

I am suppose to be a rich ass artist and had to take jobs at a gym wearing business casual making $15 an hour. $500 A WEEK. I FUCKING HATE IT. Haven't had a job all year. My heat is off now because I'm literally not making any money. 

I HATE GOD AND ALL OF THIS POSITIVE THINKING SHIT  BECAUSE WHY IS IT NOT WORKING. 

WHAT THE HELL.

I'm late on my rent this month  my parents have been supporting me but I'm tired of it. I want my own money. I want a life I love. I hate where I live even though it was my dream at one point. I might have to move back into my parents tiny disgusting home. I HATE THIS SHIT. I'm behind on so many bills. 

I got a call for a job making $17-$19 but I had to pay $140 for a background check and license in a field that is not the one I set out to pursue. I DON'T HAVE $140 TO GIVE TO A JOB BEFORE I START WORKING IT. On top of that  it could take up to a month to get the license. So I'm out $140 and have to wait a month to even start working. BULLSHIT

I literally don't know what to do. What's the point of all that believing and shit if it don't work. I apply to so many jobs every day. I even made multiple resumes and shit. I literally don't know what to do.

I need money RIGHT NOW and a whole lot of it. Money that's sustainable so I can actually live and enjoy my life  go on vacations and shit. I grew up lower middle class and I hate that's it's following me in my adult life. 

I HAVE NO MORE TIME TO WAIT ON ALL THE POSITIVE SHIT I WANT. I NEED IT TODAY. 

I would rather kill myself then go through all these downs. I've been more down than up and I'm sick of this shit. FUCK THE WORLD. I RATHER NOT BE ON IT IF IT'S GOING TO BE THIS DEPRESSING. 

I've only had one dream my whole life  be a wealthy and succesful tv and film writer  director  and producer. My whole life I've never dreamed of anything else. I started my career as a production assistant and don't even know what else to do with my life after that. I got out that role because iI hated the politics and dynamics of it and was getting severly underpaid  and since I'm a PA  nobody gives a fuck. 

I've had one dream and one dream only. I don't even know what to do with my life. Even if I did move back in  I would just lay down and mope. I feel dead inside. I hate life. I'd rather it be over than feel this way.",317,129,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1antxdq/im_ready_to_kill_myself_i_cant_take_this_anymore/

  I have loved and will miss everyone that I have ever had in my life  but I am not sorry that I did this. I hope you will understand  but no one has really understood me in the first place  so it wouldn't be the first time.

  The funniest part of it all- is that I deserve this. I wish things would have ended up differently  but there's got to be a reason why I failed. I'm tired of distracting myself with video games  music  or some other thing. I'm tired of having to talk myself off the edge every time I feel like killing myself. I am a terrible person. Don't feel sad for me  because it's either live a long life of feeling like shit or cutting it short. 

  My therapist told me that I should be nicer to myself and be curious about life  but I can't do it it anymore. I deserve suicide. My mental health has already caused pain for the ones that left  but mostly for the ones that stayed to see me slowing die. And don't even get me started on all of the hospital bills- and I don't even feel any better. 

The fact is I'm sick of watching everyone have fun with their friends  spending weekends having fun  complaining about stupid shit like guys that don't love them or tests being hard. I used to be like that  and the pain of losing it all it too much to bare. I don't want to live a life as the ghost of the person I used to be. I'm terrified of spending my 21st birthday alone. I would rather be dead.

Don't say you didn't see this coming  because if you didn't  then you truly didn't know me at all. Donate my body to science. Peace out.

With love

Edit: It's been a few days since I posted this. I'm thankful for all of the comments and DMs. To give an answer to a few questions  I am in therapy  did reaching out (as I hinted   reaching out made me lose a lot of people and one person told me I was over sharing)  and I am on meds. Nothing in life seems worth it or interesting to me. I sometimes feel okay  but it is overweighted by emptiness  loneliness  and depression. Today was my stepdad's birthday  and I didn't want to ruin his birthday with my death  but it has passed. I still think I'm going to do it. I picked the building  and now it's just a waiting game. Or maybe I will buy a gun.

Edit: 2 months have passed. I am doing a lot better. My birthday passed and it was a great amount of fun. I'm not perfectly mentally healthy  but we are starting to want to live again.

Edit: 3 months have passed. I graduated college!! I also started Prozac in addition to my other meds  and that was really helpful. I reconnected with one of my best friends from high school  and it has been really nice to talk to her. I also tried animal crossing  so that's been my hyperfixation. Overall  I am doing a lot better  but there are still some rough spots.

Edit: 4 months have passed. I guess I might do this as kind of a journal. It's been helping me out- coming back to it and reading it. It's crazy because I read what I wrote 4 months ago  and I feel like I don't know that person anymore. I understand who she is and how much pain she was in  but I feel so far removed from that and it's amazing. I don't want this to sound like a success story because I still have really hard days and nobody's success story is going to help. But I digress. I still struggle with self-harm but I don't feel suicidal everyday like I used to. I am really doing well because it's the summer but also I have plans with new friends that I made. We plan on going on a camping trip in a couple of weeks so I'm super excited about that. I was hyperfixated on Animal Crossing for a little bit but I found two horror games that I really really like. I'm applying to jobs. I still haven't found one  but I hope that I'll find one eventually. I also met this guy right after I posted my last update. He is really cool  and he lives far away  but I'm going to meet him at the end of this month. I'm super excited! I don't want to rush into anything though obviously because I still have a long way to go with my health. I have been doing better in therapy and it's been helping me a lot more than it has been in a couple of years. Anyways that's all I have for today.

Edit: 5 months have passed. Hey guys  it is time to give another update. Thank you everyone for the continued kind messages. And for those who commented cruel things  I hope the best fot you as well. I found a good job that I am going to start in a few weeks; I am going to be working with children with special needs. I am nervous  but I am also excited! I never saw myself working with kids  but this is not what I want to do long term. I really want to get my PhD; it is my dream. I lost that dream before all this... I want to make it a reality. I am still struggling with self harm and big emotions  but I am doing good. You know that guy I talked about? Well... he is going to be here today! I am so excited to meet him in person! Welp.. anyways... I hope you guys are doing well... Much love <3",354,164,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ao0o5m/im_committing_suicide_my_suicide_post_that_im/

depression,I can't go on like this.,"Tw: suicide

Heyy

First of all  sorry if I make mistakes while writing  English is not my native language. 

F (29  almost 30). I am here because I don't know where else to go. I'm desperate. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety since my teen years. I took antidepressants for almost four years  alongside some private therapy sessions  although these were not enough because I could not afford more. However  the medication did not help at all  so I gradually stopped taking it months ago (gradually).

Everything got worse when I started feeling pain almost everyday and got diagnosed with fybromialgia  for which they prescribed me opioids. Again  they do not seem to work well for me  since the pain won't go away. I had to stop working and studying because of this. Last September  I enrolled again on uni in order to try to finish my undergraduate degree. I did my best to attend most lessons  mostly because attendance was compulsory. I was not in that much pain  but since beginning of December  I have been feeling worse and worse.  

I am in dark place right now. I barely can keep with hygiene  cannot cook (if it wasn't for my sister  I would have starved)  cannot concentrate to study  don't see my friends (if I can call them that...)  etc. Honestly  I feel like a burden and a complete failure. Even if my chronic illness is not a degenerative one  it affects me tremendously in all aspects of my life. If I am not able to work and the state won't give me financial aids  how am I supposed to pay for the most basic things? My parents won't be always there to help me. My father is almost 70 and my mother is ill too  she has a stage 4 lynfoma cancer and is currently receiving radiotherapy (she is stable tho and has overcome it for seven years now). Also  besides these circumstances  I hate being so dependant on them and our relationship has been problematic since my teen years too. 

I just don't see the point of living and I have not tried to end my life because of two things: I am afraid of failing and of the consequences it would have and because of how my death would affect my family and the people around me in general. 

Thank you for reading this. I appreciate any kind of support or/and help 🙏🏻💙.

depression,After spending a year preparing myself to go on vacation and see the only person I have ever really loved  after keeping up a long distance relationship for a year she stopped responding. And a few days ago I learned that she had died a horrible death and I can't even go to her funeral.,"I'm in a very weird position right now  and I really need to vent. Because I haven't been able to get out of bed for the past few days. You don't have to read this story (its long)  but I really just need to let this out.

So  to preface this  I am in college right now  and every year since I was young I have been going to the middle east  and spending time with my family over the summer. Last summer I met a girl  who I connected with more than anybody I had ever met. As an anti-social  frankly ugly person I had never been great with women  never had a girlfriend  or a friend who is a girl. 

But this girl was beautiful and funny  not that smart but amazing. Really amazing. I spent the entire rest of my vacation with her. She was my very first girlfriend  my first kiss  my first lover. But  I had school so I had to leave  I spent one last night with her and promised to keep in touch. And I did. 

Everyday after classes I'd send her a message on WhatsApp and ask her how she was. She meant so much to me  and I felt like I wasn't worthy  so I started working out  tried to improve my Arabic  and took care of myself for once. She pushed me the entire way  talking with me on Skype and really making me better. I believed she was an angel sent to save my life  and in many ways she was. 

But a week ago  she stopped responding to my messages. I thought she had gotten bored of me  I thought the worst. And then the worst happened.

I offhandedly asked my relative in Lebanon what had happened to her. She sighed and sadly told me that she had moved away. I knew she was lying from the tone of her voice and pressed it. Which now I regret... a whole lot. 

She told me that this girl  my first motivation and first love had been murdered. She had been raped and killed  and found dead in an alley. I was so horrified I closed the phone and began to cry. I went to bed  crying. slept for 3 hours and woke up soaked in my own tears. Then I stayed in bed and haven't gone to my classes since. I've laid in bed not talking to anyone and I feel like I'm dying slowly. 

Even now I'm crying  feeling empty inside. Feeling like my heart is shuddering with every breath. I have a constant sense of despair in my stomach. And I keep sending her messages hoping that this is some sort of cruel joke on my relatives part. My parents have come by and tried to comfort me but have given up. My best friend has tried to console me but he isn't the touchy feely type to  begin with. I don't know why I wrote this  but I really need to vent  to get this out of my head before I go back to school tommorow. 

I'm sorry for the novel  thanks for reading if you got this far. 

 Edit: I really am overwhelmed by everything everyone is saying. I'm reading every comment and I hear everything everyone is saying  even if I don't reply thank you. ",330,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/34o906/after_spending_a_year_preparing_myself_to_go_on/

depression,Decided to end my life today. Take care,"hi  i’ve (23f) decided that after typing out this post  i’m going to kill myself. I’m tired of being alone  i’m tired of being anxious/depressed  i’m tired of doing absolutely nothing with my life. I fell out with every single friend that I use to be close with and last year was one of the most loneliest years for me. I finally confessed to my parents that i need help and have been on medication ever since. I graduated from college last year as well and have been so excited to start my career. It’s been 6 months and i can’t find a job. Every job opportunity i get  falls through every. single. time. and i don’t understand why  i don’t understand why everything is so hard. Rejection after rejection after rejection. and if im not searching for damn jobs  i’m in my room all day. I sometimes try to leave the house to get some air but always end up coming back home. I only ever talk to my parents or sister (and most of the time it’s awkward because they don’t really want to conversate with me sometimes).

depression,I'm so tired.. everything is breaking apart in front of my eyes  and I'd reach out to grab duct tape  if I didn't feel duct taped to my bed.,"I'm just so tired of everything. You know that fear that you imagined some time back which felt so far away? I'm headed right for it right now  and it's visible on the horizon. 

Damn all these distractions. I don't even know why I can't control myself. Here's the thing: I like imagining that I'm doing the things that I have to do. I know for a fact that I somewhat like doing it. 

But when it comes to actually doing it  I just..don't ever start doing it. Please  I know it's my own responsibility to put my life on track  but I just need help. I need someone to help put me back on *some* track. 

I'm sad  angry  frustrated  disappointed. I have all these people I can reach out to  but my own goddamned ego won't let me. I don't even know if they'd still want to know me at this point. I wouldn't be surprised if they think I'm distancing myself away from them. I'm not  please believe me. 

I'm just too afraid you'll ask me ""how are you doing?"" And I have to reply with ""Great! How're you?"" and hear you're onto something else that's new and adventurous. I do care for you  and I want to be happy for you. I know I might seem alright and doing great on the outside  but please  help me out. 

I used to be adventurous like everyone else  until I took an arrow(metaphorically) somewhere that caused me to completely not function anymore(ha). Okay  but seriously though  I don't know what the fuck happened. COVID times are still affecting me after all this time I guess  haha  fuck you  COVID. 

Stop seeing that I'm happy  the cheerful one  and happy-go-lucky  and know that I'm at that point where I'd give anything just to get an hour of true peace again. 

""Take a break""? Ha  I'm pretty sure I've been on a ""break"" these past few months(or years). ""Get your head down""? Ha  I need a fucking break. ""Then get a break?"" Ha  what do you think I've been doing? 

Fuck. 

Shit. 

Is there a stronger word than ""fuck"" to scream into a pillow?

To all reading: I'm sorry for the profanities  and possibly a little bit of humor sprinkling here and there  as well as being super fucking dramatic. It's one of the things I have left. I hope that anyone reading could at least read it as a bit entertaining.

Haha  and so. Many. Opportunities. I'm about to waste it all. I'm afraid of what's coming up. I'm sorry all these opportunities had to be spent on me. ",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jtacyo/im_so_tired_everything_is_breaking_apart_in_front/
depression,I'm just tired of everything,"Just like the title says.

I have been fighting with depression since when I was 14 years old basically  now I'm 29  school was a b\*tch and of course bullying was there.

My ""world of glass"" was broken pretty early due to the fact that my best friend came to tell me how her uncle was abusing her  and since then it was pretty easy to see the magical world of dreams and stuff burning around me.

I even tried to kill myself 3 times  and today I still ask myself why I stopped the knife from my throath those times. There was no one around to stop me  no one would have known  and yet for some reason I still don't understand why I stopped. Worst thing? My family never noticed the cuts on my arms  no one ever noticed anything about it. I told my mother years after  like when I was 19/20  and she is the only one that knows.

I can't even have a basic human relationship with my father since he is one of those ""tough love"" guys from the previous generations  doesn't understand at all emotions and everytime he is stressed because of work then it's a good enough reason for him to start screaming at those around him and say the worst things possible. (He still tries his best to ""help"" when it's normal and everything  but I really can't anymore get past this after our whole life of getting shouted at or treated like shit verbally speaking because he is stressed because of work).

And it doesn't matter I live alone now in another country  even when it happens by phone I feel everything coming back to me  all those years  all those things that happened in the past coming back at once in my mind and my mood immediately drops to the floor.

Tonight it happened again even thou I'm 29 now but it doesn't seem to make a difference  I wish so bad that I could just go to sleep and that's it  no tomorrow morning. I honestly believe that my life is not worth it  that even if I disappear no one will miss me  maybe my parents for a few days but then everything will go back to normal.

I don't know anymore what to think or to do  I just wish everything could stop.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1j4crjw/im_just_tired_of_everything/

Which defines my life im a failure who loves disappointing people. I started feeling better thinking about the new life i could have but no   god doesnt want that to happen. Maybe is was just here to tortured to face shit. But now im done i cant take this anymore if life keeps treating me like shit then i dont want it. Im better dead.

depression,I'm so tired of everything,"About 5 years ago my ex got raped I did my absolute best to make her feel better I slept only about ten hours in two weeks I was exhausted and severely depressed about what happened once I made her feel better she dumped me that destroyed me she then got with some random guy which then broke her heart she then ran back to me and my stupid ass accepted her back and once again after about a month she broke up with me to get with another guy after I made her feel better she then accused me of raping her which got me death threats and probably almost arrested she then waited three days after I told her to tell them the truth to tell them I didn't do it and she never apologized after all these years

I decided to give her one last chance at the beginning of November because I truly loved her and on the the 8th of this month after she had been spending 5 days video calling some other guy from a different state and ignoring me she told me that she couldn't do long distance relationships anymore and needed me to be in her state by next year which is a ridiculously impossible request I'm still in school I still have my belongings here and no proof that she'll actually stay with me longer than two months I told her how ridiculous that was and we broke up.

Even though I realize how ridiculous this is  my mind still convinces me I am a terrible person  worthless and undeserving of happiness and that I don't deserve to take care of myself. 
This has begun to affect my concentration and I've been losing sleep.

I was just wondering if anybody else is experiencing this? Is this a symptom of depression? Is it my low self-worth? I don't know why I feel this way. Does anyone have advice?

Thank you in advance. I'd be appreciative of any advice I can get ;-;

Edit: Guys  ty  ty  thank you for the support ;-; ❤️!! I just want to quickly say that reading the comments made me feel less alone in my struggle. It breaks my heart knowing others are going through the same thing. I took you guys' advice and spoke to someone I can trust about my stupid past actions and well  they thought I was worrying over nothing. This really made me feel relieved as I thought they'd be ashamed of me or something. It's crazy what your mind can convince you of. That being said  starting tomorrow I'll be working on my sleep schedule and treating myself better. If that fails  I will seek therapy. Good night guys  I can't thank you enough and I wish you all the best. I appreciate you all so much you lovely human beings

Edit: I'm so glad to hear that some of you are also reading the comments on here and feel a sense of relief that this is more common than you thought  honestly I had no idea either!

One day I'm going to die in this goddamned apartment and nobody will know until they smell something bad and realize they haven't seen me for awhile. Then they will all act so sad. 

I remember at my father's funeral  some man was there talking about what a good friend my father was. I looked at him and said ""Who are you?"" and then I asked him ""If he was such a good friend  why don't I know you? I'm his daughter and I've never seen you in my life.""

When I die  nobody will come to my funeral. Nobody will give a rat's ass that I am dead. That's why I'm donating my body to science.

It really did lift my spirits  though  so you did what you intended to do. This is one reason I love Reddit and why I love young people.

depression,I feel so alone (yes yet another post),"I cant talk to anyone  I can't tell anyone about how I'm feeling and I can't even put it into words. I'm so alone. Almost everyone I know is also struggling mentally so I can't talk to them about anything  it's just.. it's so fucking isolating.

Nobody even know or can see the ""hints"" or anything but I'm not even leaving ""hints"" or giving ""hints"" or at least that I can see.

I don't want to lose my best friend but I also feel like it'd be easier without them and that's horrible to say  I know it is. I love them so much and I dont want anything to happen to them but I just can't deal with any of this anymore.

depression,i feel so alone,"my boyfriend isn’t there for me

i don’t know how to keep doing this. 

my bf (25m) & i (23f) have been together on & off for 2 years. we both REALLY struggle with mental health problems & are both medicated. 

he’s currently going through a lot because he’s in the process of taking over his family business. he’s under a lot of stress & really struggles with confidence due to his dads verbal abuse 24/7. 

i moved to our city 3 years ago & am away from all family/friends. i am fully financially independent & live in a studio apartment with my cat. 

last may we broke up due to him being unable to show up for me when i was struggling. we were broken up the whole summer then got back together in august. since this ive REALLY struggled to communicate & confide with him. 

when we got back together i lost my grandma & i’ve been struggling since. 

i’m currently mentally at my lowest. today he tried to talk to me about it all  because ive shut off the entire world except work & my home. i’ve been smoking everyday & have just lost all motivation. 

tonight i think i hit rock bottom. 

after this conversation about how my mental health is effecting him  we were supposed to go to a friends sleepover birthday party & when it came time to leave i started crying. 

i told him to go without me & he did. the moment he left i had a panic attack. i didn’t reach out to him  i eventually calmed myself down & laid in bed. 

an hour later he called me  he just was double checking that i didn’t want to come & even though i did  i told him i didn’t & began to cry again. i had another panic attack & ended up throwing & breaking my phone. 

i texted him & told him i broke my phone & apologized for hanging up so abruptly. i told him to not worry about me & go have fun. 

i texted him asking if he could spend the night at 10pm & he didn’t respond until 12. when he did respond  he didn’t acknowledge  what i said & just apologized & said he’s drunk.  i just apologized for him for tonight & said goodnight. 

tonight was the first time ive ever self harmed. 

i feel so stupid & dramatic & embarrassed. i cut up my fking leg  just about broke my hand & slammed my head until i went dizzy. i feel like im insane. 

all i wanted during that was someone to come help me. i texted him  but i guess i can’t communicate it in a clear enough way. 

now i dont even know if i want to see him. i feel so abandoned & alone. i dont know what to do. as much as i want him to be here for me  i just feel so hurt. 

i wish i could just disappear. ",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jcgxs9/i_feel_so_alone/

I took a walk to get out of the funk or the lack for the better term. I might be getting into kickboxing. Been getting that suggestion from the people in my life and it’s something physical with a healthier outlet. It’s still not easy but I now know that I’m not alone.

These past couple of years have been traumatic emotionally  and I haven't found ways to cope in a healthy manner. I was sent to a psychiatric hospital last year  and it helped me only for a moment. I've been feeling very depressed again because I feel like the direction of my love life  job  and social life have not been very fulfilling in any way. I was drinking and crying at the same time  and the only thing that gave me some relief at the time was cutting myself. I believed things would be better off without me  and I didn't want to have to worry about losing anything else. I began to cut myself to feel some sense of power and control many times before my little sister walked into the room unexpectedly. She just stared at me and asked me why I was crying and I didn't have any words to say  and she just kept asking if I was okay. The thing is sometimes I don't even feel like people around my age or my parents even notice the things I go through or the things that make me feel super upset  but once my little sister asked me that question  I tried to be as passive but honest as possible. I told her I was having a hard time and needed to cry  and she just gave me a hug and asked if she helped me feel better. And something like that  I feel like is all I need from others.

I just want to have a warm hug  and someone to tell me things get better  even if that is a lie. 

I am 14 going on 15 and I have already planned a full date for my death  as it creeps closer things seem to be getting worse  as if life is preparing me for that time. Exactly at 12am  May 6th  when I am turning 25  I will finally end my life. 
I have struggled with mental health for what feels like forever  and have tried multiple ways to feel better. I have gone to therapists and have come back empty handed and with alot of money wasted  I am also currently on medication  that I often forget to take  and that helps  but will eventually not help anymore. 
I only have 2 friends I actively speak to  but even then we don't do much. I don't have anyone to call with  I don't have anyone to play games with. It feels so awful to come home from school and lay in my bed all day till I eventually fall asleep because I don't have enough motivation to finish projects or get up to do anything. 

I really need some support and validation  as I live and breathe off stupid things like that. I have been staying alive for this long due to people in my life complimenting little things I do  and I'm aware it's an issue. I hate myself for it. I am disgusted when I look at myself  and think about how I'm purely living off what other people tell me or say to me.

I take paracetamol for the headache shortly before she comes home from work but I think I'm starting to build up tolerance. I switched to ibuprofen since I was advised it would also help with masking the swollen eyes but it doesn't really help as much  and it's supposed to be taken with food but my appetite is all over the place so that doesn't always work.

I even tried not drinking as much water but that doesn't help too much  somehow my body just keeps generating all this liquid I guess.

depression,Why does everything hurt? Why can't I just die?,"Honestly this is more of a rant then anything else.

First of all  to anyone worried I'm not (immediately) contemplating suicide. 

Idk what's wrong with me sometimes  I don't want to get out of bed or even get up  I'm pissed when I wake up in the first place. When I have to go to school I feel really shitty  I'm not bullied  grades are average  not bad but not amazing  all my teachers are nice and yet I dread going so much I've considered suicide  it just feels like it's wasting my life. 

My home life is ok  nothing to complain about. But I rarely feel happy anymore  sometimes I'll watch some shows or play a video game or read a book  but the instant I remember none of it is real the empty hollowness that just makes me feel like I want to die.

I have no clue why I feel like this. My will to live is basically non-existent and I'm pretty damn tired of my pathetically short and bland life",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ef4g4o/why_does_everything_hurt_why_cant_i_just_die/
depression,I’m 50 years old and I just want to give up.,"I’m tired  I don’t have anything that brings me joy any more.  I used to work on home projects  cars  all sorts of things.  Now I just get frustrated and angry.  I used to read all the time  now I get ten pages in and just feel like fuck this.  Work is just going through the paces  I feel like I’m not even there even when I am.  I really want to die  I would kill myself if not for my wife and kids.  I won’t kill myself until they’re out of college and my wife is passed (she will probably outlive me though  so I have to keep getting up every damn day).  My wife doesn’t want sex anymore  I don’t know.  I have guns  I can easily kill myself  a .40 caliber round through the brain stem.  I just can’t do it because I have all these people to support.

I’m looking for new jobs.  I don’t seem to be in demand as a senior hardware engineer  or at least I don’t get calls back.  I’m taking drugs to make me feel happy.  They kill the anxiety but not the perpetual sadness.  That’s another thing I can’t fucking control  I cry all the damn time.  I try to stop  shove push pins in my thighs  nothing works.  Not very manly for damn sure.  I can usually control it in public but my kids see it sometimes and that just makes me feel worse.

Counselors are too damn expensive  though I am taking prescription drugs that help.  Sorry  this is too long  you get the picture.  Ahhh I just wish I would die quickly from something.

EDIT:  Thank you everyone for your support  it means a lot.  I have no friends so it’s good to know that other people at least have some empathy for what I’m feeling.  I’m trying  and I’ll keep getting up and working for my family.  Deep down  though  I’m hoping a bus hits me or someone randomly decides to kill me.

depression,Decided to end my life today. Take care,"hi  i’ve (23f) decided that after typing out this post  i’m going to kill myself. I’m tired of being alone  i’m tired of being anxious/depressed  i’m tired of doing absolutely nothing with my life. I fell out with every single friend that I use to be close with and last year was one of the most loneliest years for me. I finally confessed to my parents that i need help and have been on medication ever since. I graduated from college last year as well and have been so excited to start my career. It’s been 6 months and i can’t find a job. Every job opportunity i get  falls through every. single. time. and i don’t understand why  i don’t understand why everything is so hard. Rejection after rejection after rejection. and if im not searching for damn jobs  i’m in my room all day. I sometimes try to leave the house to get some air but always end up coming back home. I only ever talk to my parents or sister (and most of the time it’s awkward because they don’t really want to conversate with me sometimes). And i force myself to hang out with boys who don’t give af about me and only want sex (just because i want someone to talk to). I always try to have hope for myself but it’s running out. I told myself that this year would be different and i don’t want to feel how i felt last year but i slowly feel myself falling back in the dark hole again and i can’t take it. I feel like im going crazy and i hate everything. I feel like im fucking suffocating and i’m so close to climbing out of the black hole  but keep getting pushed further in. I’m tired of people telling me i need to be grateful  and that i have family and a college degree and there’s no reason for me to be depressed. I’m tired of having hope for myself  just for things to go back horrible again. I hate everything and i don’t want to be here anymore. I don’t want to kill myself but i have to. I’m tired of feeling this anger  sadness  anxiousness  etc and no psychiatrist or therapist can help me anymore. I’m sorry. If you took the time to read this  well i’m sorry to you too…i don’t know. goodbye. 


hi everyone. my attempt was unsuccessful and i unfortunately woke up this morning and don’t know what to do. i feel awkward and embarrassed🧍🏽‍♀️ and im sorry for worrying you all  i did not expect for this many people to see or reach out. i’m just so sorry  i was on my last straw yesterday and gave up on myself and everybody in this thread by actually going through with it. my intention was never to worry anyone at all  i just felt suffocated and needed to write out my last thoughts. I woke up this morning with hesitation in my heart and idk if that’s a good thing. i’m sorry  im sorry  im sorry💗 (um  i guess ill put this message in the post too)

Told my bf I’m sorry for fucking things up and don’t think in ANY SENSE OF THE WORD anyone will try help. I’ve been in counselling for 16 months. I’ve tried anti depressants  I’ve tried coping mechanisms and absolutely anything to get thru it and not feel like the whole fucking world is against me.

And I’m done. I give up. I can’t do this. I don’t know what I’ve done to deserve this  but it is what it is. I wish I was never born. 

My family can’t make time to come to my graduation meal I was paying for. My friends are embarrassed to be seen with me. My bf was the only thing keeping me afloat and I’ve ruined things. And my whole fucking brain is screaming at me to be taken out.

depression,Is it worth even attempting to try anymore? Should I just give up and be a bum the rest of my life?,"As you all may or may not know about me  my dream is to get noticed in the Media field as either an editor or voice-actor. Editing videos and trying voice-acting are 2 things I love to do. However  I've tried since I was a teenager to get represented or noticed  but have had no luck whatsoever. I've taken college classes for editing and have also taken acting and voice-acting classes from professionals  but have pretty much come to realize that it's impossibly competitive to get into the business at all.

In fact  it's so impossibly competitive that I've pretty much given up on even trying to get myself noticed. I can't market myself  because I don't have the skills to do so. I even have a website and demo reels on it  but not the skills to sell myself. Not to mention I don't live where all the jobs and agencies are and can't afford to. And both my depression and anxiety  massive factors in this  will only ever get worse and worse even with the meds I take.

The other thing is that I believe that even if someone wanted to represent me to help me get noticed  it still wouldn't happen because I'm neurodivergent. Autism to be exact  which I believe is a mental illness. Which is why I have to ask the question. Is it even worth attempting to try anymore? Not just to get noticed  but doing so in a way that will make me happy? Or at 37 years old  should I just give up and be a bum the rest of my life?

Maybe it's because I don't think I can fully engage with stuff  I do things for something to do and whilst it's fun when I'm there  my mind is elsewhere waiting for the thing to be over. The only time I feel fully there is when I'm alone and crying from how much everything hurts.

I don't know how to carry on like this. Two years ago when I was in the aftermath of something traumatic I had more energy than I do now  I had more motivation to 'get better' but now it's gone. Everything I once had that made me feel better no longer does. I quit drinking (again) but have relapsed with self harm  the only thing stopping me from getting worse with that is the fact it's coming up to summer and it doesn't really help anyway. I just want the pain to stop and though I won't realistically do anything drastic  I don't see any other way out  I just want it all to be over.

I don't want to go on medication  my mom has been on increasingly strong antidepressants for 30 years and I don't want to become like her. But the fact both she and my nan had severe depression (my nan's was so bad she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for a while) and now I have my own trauma to deal with makes me worried I'm doomed to be in pain like this forever.

depression,I’m giving up on myself and fighting for positive changes,"All my life so far (24 f) has been this never ending back and forth of emotions. The constant feeling has been exhaustion and lack of will to do anything. I was diagnosed with bipolar depression in 2019 and have since been going through the works of trying out different concoctions of medications and meeting with my therapist. College was a wreck and lead to my dropping out. I’ve been sitting at home with my parents for the last 2 years  unable to get myself into looking for a job  and slowly succumbing to where I am now: struggling to do personal hygiene  refusing to go outside  gets anxiety and the minimalist of things  and absolutely cannot get myself to go see my horse. 

I am not suicidal  but I’m just so tired of yelling at myself to just do it (it being whatever task) and having it fall into this chasm of emptiness that separates my wants and my actions. I’m eating  taking my meds regularly  and sleeping a lot. I have a small social life online  I read  I talk to my parents everyday.

depression,I'm just lost and broken.,"I have no idea where to go from here. Long story short  I am losing everything. I am a single mom of multiple kids and suffer from severe Crohn's Disease  PTSD  and Bipolar Depression. 

I lost my well paying job due to last minute call outs to participate in the active investigation involving one of my children (since the case still hasn't gone to court  I will not give anymore details). The final straw was when I had to admit my child to a behavioral center for hurting themselves. As a single mom  I needed the severance pay so I signed the severance agreement which included no lawsuits.

I now have a job (and I'm still job searching) that's harsh on my disease and very low paying. I simply can't pay my bills. I'm expecting an eviction notice any day now and can't afford anywhere else.

I also just had to readmit same child for hurting themselves due to the bullying they're receiving at school. We've tried multiple therapists and psychiatrists for my child and I just feel so lost. 

My Crohn's Disease is rampant due to not being able to get treated. I'm in constant pain  exhausted  and my weight has withered away even more  leaving my weight in the 2 digits (I'll make an example of 90lbs).

I just feel like a failure as a mother and as a woman. I've been trying everything I can and everything is falling apart. Everything feels so hopeless. My children look to me for strength and I try to show them this  but I'm at my weakest point and I don't even want to function anymore.

depression,I hope someone reads this. I'm completely broken and I don't understand. Is there ANY way even possible to stop or reduce the pain besides sleeping  drugs/alcohol  or suicide?,"I've tried everything. I continue to try anything. There's nothing that works to make me feel any better besides sleeping or using substances to make my brain totally stop.


People who say you can't kill yourself don't understand that that means *actively choosing* to feel so so horrible. And nobody ever offers any way to make the pain feel any better.


Yes there are (very few but some) people I care about but I have to weigh if it's worth it to feel like this and I don't think it is.


Is there ANY way to make this less of a hell for me? Or when people tell me not to kill myself are they just expecting me to suffer forever in a life I hate?


That's honestly what I think people are saying with that  whether they realize it or not. They're just giving me an impossible expectation of feeling this way forever and not doing anything about it 


""You say you feel unimaginably terrible  and I know you only have one way out  but uhhh don't take it. Just keep suffering instead.""


I don't think there's any way to make this hurt less. I've already tried everything. 


When people tell me not to do it they can finish the conversation and go about their day without thinking about it  but they don't understand that I'm stuck in this reality no matter what. When they stop talking to me they can leave the topic but the topic is just my reality.


Nobody actually understands because if they did they wouldn't think it's so crazy for me to consider suicide so heavily. They don't know how bad this pain is and that it's *always* there. I don't get a break from it unless I'm sleeping or sloppy drunk. Those are literally the only two things that can numb it and they're both only temporary.

depression,I'm afraid I'm broken forever,"I think I'm cursed to be broken forever. It's probably just overdramatics and crazy horomones since I struggle with both PTSD responses and PCOS (a hormonal/metabolic reproductive based disorder) but I feel like the pit in my stomach and the aching in my head will never go away. Only in moments of total bliss and full distraction do I forget the feeling in my gut until I realize its gone and that reminder brings it back. I have to find a new therapist all over again after technical/billing issues with the apps of both services my work covers so now I will probably have to pay copays I already cannot afford. 

My life has been an uphill battle between a borderline psycho  disfunctional family I became the caretaker of consequently going through parentification and an extreme stressor from my nightmare grandmother screaming and dictating my parents house because she owned the apartment building we grew up in. Even the adults I felt loved me the most reminded me in small ways I wasnt good enough by either ignoring me and walking away or commenting on my weight or strange interests. I've been so sensitive since I was young even feeling bad for the adults that screamed at me because I knew they were in pain. I can't even look in a mirror most days without hating what I see. I absorbed all their anger and idk what to do with it. I never wanted to be angry. I want to change and be free. 

I'm trying to quit smoking weed to get a better job but I'm scared about what will happen to my mental state without a proper therapist to guide me but my living situation and misery at my job demands I make a change or I will keep sinking in a pit. Sometimes I think of just leaving and never looking back  but I have made a life with someone that I don't feel like I deserve anymore. I have messed up so much in our relationship because of my issues but when I wanted to split he found a way to get through to me having his own issues wanting us to work through them together despite both our shortcomings that led up to the potential split. I don't know what I would have done without his beautiful love. It makes me even sicker with myself for the times I was mean to him even if he had made crude comments or remarks himself. 

I have struggled with rapidly decending motivation since I was 16 and I'm now 26 not wanting to leave my house as much as possible  hating being in the house I'm in wishing I had the energy and vigor to take on the world like I really want to but finding myself at home with my dog preferably  isolating myself in waves. I feel pathetic even though deep down I know I'm just tired of runnning on the hamster wheel I've pushed myself to run on for fear pf ultimate failure and rejection from the world. Somehow my mind always finds the reason the world doesn't need or want me.. staying positive only helps so much when you still feel like you're sinking in quicksand every step you take. 

Has anyone had a similar experience at life and had the same trauma issues with physical pain and overcome them? Found success and self-love with at least enough energy to live a whole life? Will I drag my past with me  desperately trying to find the missing piece of the puzzle and only feeling more lost? Any advice/personal experinces would be amazing.. I'm so tired of feeling hopeless.

depression,I'm broken.,"Hello. First time posting here. I am a 22 year old male  never been on meds or have an official diagnosis. 

I felt depressed since I was 15  mainly because of my autistic-like behaviour and extreme naiveness  and bad social behaviour. I can't even ask a girl out for a coffee because I develop scenarios in my head where if I ask her out  she will reject me and publicly shame me or smth...it really brings me down  and seeing my friends and people my age have 3 4 girlfriends under their belt and even active relationships just sends my mood down. There were times when I was out with my friends and barely said 3 words in the whole day...

Now I need to say that I've been severely bullied in elementary school and high school  ranging from name calling to taking my stuff (bag  books  phone  etc) and shoving them in a toilet. My mind never really fully coped with that  like I am a 6 year old child mentally and can't mature...I am 22 years old  I should live my life to the fullest  and yet I have a 6 year old mentallity...Why?

depression,I'm a 13 year old boy who is abused and need help,"I'm 13 years old and I live with my dad. I'm shared custody from my mom to my dad. My dad is very abusive towards me. I've been diagnosed with depression and PTSD and I've gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time I'm with my dad I want to kill myself. He pushes me to the limit and I'm afraid that. 

Ever since I was  little  my dad has always beaten me with a belt. Even before I was old enough for school. My dad has beaten me for not doing what I was told to do. He yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be. And that makes me feel sad because I miss my mom. Recently  my grades dropped. I've been having problems at school. I have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what I'm being taught. My dad was pissed. One moment he’s screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me I won't achieve anything in life. And telling me I'm going to regret it when he’s done with me.

My 11 year old brother also made a bad grade  so he walked into my brothers room and I heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt. Then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand. I held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt. I screamed and held my hand  but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again.

Then he told both of us to come in the kitchen. He started yelling at us saying he was in an ""ass whooping mood"" and that he'd beat us whenever we felt like it. That if we didn't care about our grades he wouldn't care either. That he'd make us feel his pain. He hit me extremely hard. My hand was red and swollen. I had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch. He told me to hurry and wash the dishes before he'd do it again. And he did. But my hand hurt too badly. He threatened to hold me down.

I'm going to kill myself if I have to continue to live with him. I cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it  I decided that when I go back to my mom's on Sunday I am refusing to go back to my dad's. This is what it's come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom doesn't have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long. So I am not going. I know my dad will call the police if I don't go. When they come  I will talk to them and tell them my situation.

Can they force me to go? What will they do? Because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me. I am in fear of my life and I don't want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so I just can't be around him. I don't know how many times I've tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this.

He doesn't care  he simply denies treating me the way he does saying he's never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass  idiot  son of a b\*\*\*  and he even calls my brother those things and denies it. Then when we're in public or around other people he acts like a totally sweet person  and his girlfriend thinks that I'm the problem because he constantly complains about me when really it's just a big show.

What will the cops do about it when they come?",1885,177,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fmfemk/im_a_13_year_old_boy_who_is_abused_and_need_help/
depression,My “psychiatrist” told my mom behind my back that she never believed anything I ever told her and she doesn’t think I actually need or deserve help  and I heard it all,"This will be a little long so bear with me  but I just feel really fucked over and idk what to think about this :/

So I had this terrible excuse for a psychiatrist for almost a year that acted like my MOM was her patient instead of me. She’s been really shitty to me from the beginning and would never listen to any of my concerns. For context  she is not my first psychiatrist. I’ve been on meds for over two years and needed a new psychiatrist after coming back from residential and she was the only one available. 

At my consultation with her she talked to my mom for an hour and talked to me for five minutes. Every appointment after that was the same  shed listen to my mom on everything and never listen to any of my concerns and had the audacity to constantly tell my mom how to “parent” me. She’s booked other patients over me and forgotten my appointments multiple times too. She never listened to my concerns and I always felt like she didn’t believe me.

Lately I’ve been getting more depressed again after a bad breakup. So she was talking to my mom yesterday for 90% of my appointment time as usual and she starts telling my mom how I’m lying to her  my suicide attempt was just to manipulate her  how I’m just seeking attention and using depression as an excuse to do badly in school and not get out of bed  how she thinks everything I tell her is bullshit and my mom should stop listening to me  and that I don’t actually need meds and she doesn’t think I have depression  how I need more chores and shouldn’t be allowed to go out with my friends… when I first started seeing her I felt really uncomfortable talking to her because of the way she would take my moms word over mine and eventually I got over myself and actually started telling her my concerns. She took me starting to warm up to her as me not actually having depression and took me not talking to her at first as me FAKING depression… there’s just no winning there?? No matter what I did she still believed I was attention seeking  not talking to her is faking depression and actually talking to her means I’m perfectly fine I guess?

Like I said she is NOT my first psychiatrist   I’ve been diagnosed for years  been to php  iop  residential  have a 504  have self harm issues and attempts in the past) and when my mom told her Ive been more depressed after my really nasty breakup last week she says “no teenager should be that sad over a breakup  I’d be more concerned over what she was doing with her boyfriend” and at this point I was like what the fuck… since I realized she’d actually been lying to me the entire time and she wouldn’t listen to my concerns about my meds because she never believed I had depression in the first place? 

When my mom brings the laptop upstairs for me to talk to her for the last 30 seconds of my appointment I just say “how can you help me if you never believe anything I say and you take my moms word over mine?” She gets mad and tells me to give it back to my mom. Then she starts yelling at me and says “this is a total breach of confidentiality and it’s unacceptable  I refuse to treat you anymore” and then I said “how can you even treat me if you don’t listen to your own patient and act like my MOM is your patient instead of me” and she’s like “yeah you’re so right! I can’t be your doctor if I never believe anything you say😊” then she hangs up. Now I have no psychiatrist and my mom won’t speak to me.

depression,Decided to end my life today. Take care,"hi  i’ve (23f) decided that after typing out this post  i’m going to kill myself. I’m tired of being alone  i’m tired of being anxious/depressed  i’m tired of doing absolutely nothing with my life. I fell out with every single friend that I use to be close with and last year was one of the most loneliest years for me. I finally confessed to my parents that i need help and have been on medication ever since. I graduated from college last year as well and have been so excited to start my career. It’s been 6 months and i can’t find a job. Every job opportunity i get  falls through every. single. time. and i don’t understand why  i don’t understand why everything is so hard. Rejection after rejection after rejection. and if im not searching for damn jobs  i’m in my room all day. I sometimes try to leave the house to get some air but always end up coming back home. I only ever talk to my parents or sister (and most of the time it’s awkward because they don’t really want to conversate with me sometimes). And i force myself to hang out with boys who don’t give af about me and only want sex (just because i want someone to talk to). I always try to have hope for myself but it’s running out. I told myself that this year would be different and i don’t want to feel how i felt last year but i slowly feel myself falling back in the dark hole again and i can’t take it. I feel like im going crazy and i hate everything. I feel like im fucking suffocating and i’m so close to climbing out of the black hole  but keep getting pushed further in. I’m tired of people telling me i need to be grateful  and that i have family and a college degree and there’s no reason for me to be depressed. I’m tired of having hope for myself  just for things to go back horrible again. I hate everything and i don’t want to be here anymore. I don’t want to kill myself but i have to.

depression,I've Been Crying every Night Since I Was 8 and I badly Need Help.,Hello  I'm Andria Mhea and I am 13 years old. I rarely express my feelings or sharing things online so sharing this feels incredibly awkward  and I'm scared of being bullied online. I’m not exactly dealing with depression  but I have struggled with uncontrollable crying at night since I was 8 years old. At first  I thought it was normal and didn’t want to acknowledge it. But as I’ve grown older  it’s only gotten worse. Now  every night  I find myself crying non-stop even writing this brings tears to my eyes. My sleep schedule is completely out of control. I sleep during the day and stay awake all night  which only intensifies the cycle of crying. This constant sadness is starting to affect my daily life  my energy  and how I see myself. I feel trapped in this pattern  and sometimes I worry that these feelings might take over and just end my life right here. I’m really embarrassed and ashamed to share this  but I’m desperate for help or even just some advice. If anyone has experienced something similar or knows of ways to break this cycle  please just please share your thoughts or resources that might help me get back to a healthier routine. I truly need someone to guide me through this. Thank you for taking the time to read my post. I hope that by opening up  I can find some comfort and support to help me overcome this struggle.,4,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jnhvdz/ive_been_crying_every_night_since_i_was_8_and_i/

i hate myself when i see my parents with that disappointed look on their faces while talking to me  it's like i feel bad for myself thru them lol but then i remember that i basically have no more friends left  idk if having a childhood friend that is also a junkie who i smoke weed with twice a month when he has no one else to call counts as friend  no job except working a part time job once a year  i worked a 2nd one in construction until just recently  but was fired after 10 days because i was ""not needed anymore""  no girlfriend  that makes my mom so sad sometimes because she wants grandchildren so badly

where i'm from if you're in your 20s and still living with your parents and you're not having a decent explanation for it you are instantly a failure and ppl look at you weird because roughly 90% of ppl i know are either in college  or having a job and a decent social life or all 3 at once  i have NONE

for the last 3 years of being a depressed shut-in i didn't grow as a person at all i still have the same ambitions  when i ran into an old friend couple weeks ago he told me how the fuck am i still stuck in being a teenager  because i always tell the same jokes  do the same inappropriate things  talk the same...

my god it absolutely fucking hurts seeing my old friends being so normal  so happy  taking pic after pic from vacation  having beautiful girls  some getting married even  having decent jobs  a place of their own while i spend 80% of my time on reddit  youtube  facebook  watch tv shows  listen to music and play games sometimes

i can't see my life getting better because i've already tried some things and it didn't help  and good luck for me having a girlfriend because who the fuck wants a guy who is 22 and still living with his parents and basically never goes out  plus i gained like 20 pounds in the last 2 months  so not only i'm socially anxious and depressed as hell now i'm also chubby on top of all that  the only thing i do outside of the house is drive around with my bike every other day  visiting places i spent happiest and the most careless days of my life with my friends  i visit places where we'd get drunk and go to night clubs during 2011- 2013  then go out of town to see the beautiful landscape that makes me feel alive and then back to home

i had a decent life back in high school  it's like i peaked and my lfie is only going down the spiral  i never thought life could become this hopeless and hard",884,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6wym9h/i_fucking_hate_when_that_wtf_am_i_doing_with_my/
depression,I’m becoming severely depressed and hate my life !,To start. I just turned 30. I’ve been saying to my partner how I want a huge deal for my birthday because it’s a huge milestone to me. He did nothing. Literally nothing. Not even flowers or balloons. I woke up literally crying that morning and he never even asked me why.. he never even said happy birthday. It’s not just that.. anytime I address anything. It’s brushed off. I’m not allowed to feel that way or “why are you dwelling on it”. I’m not allowed to have feelings. And it if I say anything I’m crazy and ridiculous. I’m just so tired of living this life. I want to be heard and appreciated for everything I put out. I’m putting out so much and I’m not receiving anything in return. I just feel so dead inside. What’s even the point of this life if you can’t enjoy it  you know?,28,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1hyq48c/im_becoming_severely_depressed_and_hate_my_life/
depression,I hate myself  hate my life. I’m tired of being that friend that consistently needs a shoulder to cry on.,Hi everyone  been going through this community all morning and it’s hard to say it but it came as a relief to see others feeling the way I do. Lonely burdened with life   seeing no self worth once again  more suicidal than ever. I’m writing this with so much tears in my eyes because for the longest of time I have felt myself slipping  running out of time. Have fought suicidal thoughts since 2019 and now I feel I am not stronger than that urge. I have a daughter  she is a toddler. Her father is horrible to me and to her and it isn’t in our lives  so if I kill myself my daughter will have nothing and no one. But I’m alive  I can’t even give her anything. She doesn’t even stay with me. I lost my job mid year  I’ve just been drinking myself silly  I turn 27 in 3 weeks and I have nothing to show for it. It’s probably my last month in this apartment I’m at because I can no longer afford it. All my family are at other provinces . I’m going to be homeless  I don’t know what my next move is. I keep trying and I keep losing and nothing seems to work out. This is so painful 😖 my heart is literally shredding now. I’m also paraplegic  it happened 7 years ago. It’s like something I battle with everyday ☹️always feel like peoples affection for me comes from a POV that they feel sorry for me. I can’t even talk to my friends because it feels like I’m always that friend that needs to be spoken off the ledge. I’m tired. I hope one day I will pluck up the courage to finally get it over or done with. Or just be run 🏃 over by a truck or something.

I have been having these anxiety-like attacks every morning where I wake up feeling like something is lodged in my throat and have trouble breathing. I also feel alot of discomfort and end up groaning while trying to find a position which is comfortable for me. I have no idea how long these episodes last  but they happen between 6-8am every single day. I cant get up at all  as my body forces me to stay put. I end up knocking out in a very deep sleep for a few more hours and end up getting out of bed by 12-1pm. my day life is spoiled and Im hours behind in my work. what can I do to get myself up?

depression,I've been diagnosed with severe depression and moderate social anxiety. I've been dealing with the occasional panic attacks as well. I'm tired. I just want to be normal. I don't want to fight tooth and nail just to exist anymore.,"I'm surrounded by people yet I feel so fucking alone. I'm surrounded by hope and love and happiness and all I can think about is blowing my brains out. All I can see are my flaws. Being fat. Being lazy. Being a failure. Being a disappointment. Being alone. Being me. But what I hate the most is my tendency to self sabotage. Like eating junk when on a diet. Or staying up late or procrastinating. Or for example when I attempted to avoid a test by breaking my own arm.

I'm 19  and I've never even had a girlfriend. I've never held hands with a girl or had such a private  intimate relationship with someone that I could not hide behind anything. I know it's all my fault. Knowing this kills me. It frustrates me. I fucking hate it. What's worse is while I'm at work and I'm interacting with people  I've learned to adapt a mask. It helps me to manage to interact with people. I just imagine they aren't talking to me  but a normal functioning person.

It doesn't help when I later have a panic attack and I can't figure out why I can't just adopt this mask and be normal. Why I can't just... Stop being sad. Stop being alone. Stop being desperate. 

I hate myself. I hate what I need to do in order to function everyday. I hope I can one day just be free of it all. I know that it is likely to not happen.

depression,Chronic depression and anxiety attack over the nature of my GFs work as a film producer. What kind of therapist shall I contact for help?,"I've been single for a decade (40m) and have just found a wonderful woman but ironically her field of work is a huge trigger for me that I have been working on avoiding.

I find so many forms of film and TV triggering but one of the most difficult things for me is extreme sexual violence and gratuitous sexual content.

It has olahueome my whole adult life and I live in a state of constant anxiety.

My new GF works in film as a film producer and I've ironically been avoiding film. I genuinely break down and cry with some of the things I see and I think TV is largely toxic and brainwashing (to me personally).

There are things I've seen that I can't escape from my thoughts and I saw the other day she was watching something that included these things (genitals being cut off and shoved in their mouth. Awful stuff).

I broke down and was too embarrassed to talk to her. Eventually I told her how much it bothered me and she admitted she had seen all of the things that had plagued my mind and worse. 

I don't blame her of course but I've been in a constant anxiety attack since. I feel ill as anything. Can't think  can't sleep  heart pounding  chest hurting  feel dizzy  don't feel real and don't know where I am etc.

She keeps saying she can't help what she's seen and what she does for work and says she will see more of that due to the nature of her job even if she doesn't want to.

My brain is so much worse knowing she's seen these things and will continue to do so. I have a constant flick book of thoughts and images of these awful films and themes and how they must be damaging society  my GFs brain and my own.

I keep telling myself not to worry and that it doesn't change her but I'm in constant suffering and agony over it.

She's otherwise great so it seems crazy to leave her for this but I can't cope. I can't escape it. The feelings won't go if I leave but I can continue to hide from TV and even society as best as possible.

But is there a way out of this?

Do you think I likely have a specific kind of mental health issue and if so who is best to see and what kind of therapy?

Thanks so much in advance ",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1hm0zia/chronic_depression_and_anxiety_attack_over_the/
depression,I (34f veteran) Just got evaluated for depression and anxiety  after only getting 40 hours of sleep in two weeks and feeling lightheaded for hours during the day and having so many darn panic attacks. This is hell but I want to move forward and move past it. ,I thought I had cancer  addisons disease  an infection amongst a thousand other things. My anxiety manifested into health anxiety  death anxiety  anxiety of flying  until it got the point I was afraid of sleeping because I would feel like fainting in my sleep and I’d wake up in a panic. I was not fainting of course it’s just I’m hyper aware of myself and how I feel and the feeling of going into deep sleep shocks me. This turned into insomnia because of fear of sleep. Lack of appetite  stomach issues  nausea  lightheadedness  presyncope feelings. I was in fucking hell for 2-3 weeks. I lost 12 pounds. I felt like I was dying my body was giving out on me. Until I spoke to my aunt and father who went through the same thing. He took me to a psychiatrist and I got meds. However  with my anxiety meds just are not for me they make me feel worse they cause me not to sleep. If anyone has dealt with anxiety and depression the natural way and want to share their experience I’d love to listen. I am willing to try anything and everything natural. My mind is still pushing through and I want to get out of this and return to my old self. I know I can and I will. Any shared are appreciated.

depression,I just quit my job 5 hours ago and I already had 2 anxiety attacks,"I (30F) was working as an interpreter through the phone. In this job you get calls from a lot of different areas which include psychiatric. 

To give a little more details I've had depression since I was 16 which has developed different ways which included an ED  choosing partners out of pure loneliness/sadness among others. I've tried to unsubscribe from planet earth at least 9 times being last time around 3 months ago. After that  my supervisor and current bf urged me to go to therapy so I went to a psychiatrist  who diagnosed me with major depression  anxiety and a borderline personality disorder  and a psychologist at the same time  I've been to therapy around 2 times with the psychiatrist and 3 with the psychologist.

I was  since I got the job back in April  having an anxiety attack weekly leading to my last attempt to log out of life. I have to add that I don't like talking on the phone even with my family but I thought that maybe this job would help me cause... I was gonna get paid for it lol (good pay for my country's standards).

My mental health has declined rapidly as I can't sleep even when taking pills and I keep overthinking the entire day  this has affected my physical health as I've been in and out of the ER room for high blood pressure  high glucose  ear and throat infections and a bunch of things.

Please note that I worked 9:30am to 6:30pm but  I barely sleep  I have 2 dogs and live with an elderly mother who can barely do things around the house  so I will describe a regular work day as the fact of me not having a moment for me really stresses me out. I wake up  make breakfast for me and my mother  have to clean around the house and feed a puppy I have  cook lunch then work  finish work  feed the dogs  make dinner  eat and MAYBE I get like 1 hour before I'm falling asleep to then wake up a million times during the night and not be able to go back to sleep because I am overthinking my life. Also  my mother is the main reason of my depression among other things yet I can't leave her cause I'm an only child  she has no family and can't defend herself as she used/should be able to.

  
This morning  after my last medical leave ended I was supposed to get back to work and I got a huge anxiety attack and migraine which lead me to quit my job  after this my bf told me ""I am so disappointed in you  I never thought that you would let your feelings control what you know you need to do"" and this made me feel even worse.

  
I'm sorry I can't get my ideas in a more coherent or less rambling way. Is there any way you suggest I could cope with work stress? This besides of what my therapist told me of ""go out for walks with the dogs"" or ""do something you like"". I would really appreciate everything you can tell me.

I have a partner and we have 3 dogs and a cat  but yet  it just doesn't fill that emptiness and I feel guilty about it. I tried to commit suicide when I was about 18 and I'm really upset I didn't die  most times I think about all the ways I could try again and focus on building up that ""courage"" to go through with something. I hate my life  I hate who I am  I hate how I am. I feel hopeless.",7,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jt00c7/i_just_feel_empty/
depression,I feel empty,I’m a 26 almost 27 year old woman and I feel empty. Every time I feel like I’m meeting someone halfway interested in me they disappear. I don’t have anyone to talk to. Men don’t stay interested in me. I’m a bigger girl and I used to think maybe that was a reason. But I truly am starting to think I might just have a bad personality. I feel empty inside. I don’t think I need a man to be fulfilled but good lord even another friend would be nice at this point. ,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1juds9a/i_feel_empty/
depression,I feel so empty inside,Lately I’ve never felt so alone  I have loved ones and a blessed life but I feel hollow inside. I think about leaving this earth atleast twice a day on a good day. I can’t make connections with people I try to but I’m just not like everyone else and no one gets me. I have such a kind heart and so much love to give but people are just so shitty these days. I don’t feel like I have control over my life anymore  and it seems  like everyone’s just trying to make my life more difficult instead of wanting to help. I will probably delete this eventually but I just need to air it out. This pain in my chest doesn’t go away I always feel it just like I always feel the hole in the pit of my stomach. I’m not alone in life but I feel alone. I have so much to live for but I’m tired. I’m lonely. And I feel worthless.,22,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jk4duo/i_feel_so_empty_inside/
depression,Why do I always feel empty after achieving something?,"For as long as I can remember  I’ve chased goals—grades  fitness  work promotions—thinking they’d make me happy. But every time I reach a milestone  I feel nothing. No excitement  no satisfaction  just an empty ""what’s next?"" feeling. I thought achieving things would fill the void  but it never does.

depression,Too tired and disappointed to have any will to try - What I really want is the end,"Decades of therapy and drugs. I know I didn't put as much effort as I could. I know I didn't fight myself and my bad habits as much as I should. My therapist always says that just trying is a reason to celebrate - but I'm just too tired of this  to the point that I'm willingly not trying anything anymore.

I decided long ago the only path I have is going away. Since I didn't do anything yet  it's clear that a part of me wants to live and get better - but I've been feeding way more the part that already gave up. They're always fighting  but I've been focusing my mind in the >!""suicidal"" !<part  listening to its arguments  and encouraging myself to brood over it.

As many here  I don't dream of getting better  I just dream of finding courage to just >!take my life.!<What I'm trying to find is resolve.

To me  nothing in this world is worth the effort of living. I never experienced the satisfaction of winning over challenges  or found happiness in little details or whatever. Everything in this life demands effort and sacrifice. Some learn how to enjoy the fight  but I didn't. I dislike pain  and I like the easy. Coward  lazy  hypocritical  poor-minded  call me whatever you want. I am all of those things and I know  and I blame myself for it  I'm ashamed of it  but I still embrace it  and will always intend to.

My biggest obstacle  the final boss  are my family and my pets. Just thinking about the toll this would take on them... Sometimes I conclude I'll never>! take my life !<because I'll never be able to overcome this concern. So while I don't find the resolve  I can't help but comply with the ""at least I'm trying""  so I'm still doing therapy and taking my medicines.

On the other hand  this is what I'm trying to detach myself from. When I learn to truly follow my own values and listen to my own voice rather than giving so much space to the others in my life  when I learn to just do things instead of worrying so much about the others' expectations  that's when I'll finally move on with my life  either in the best of ways or in the worst of them.

Every night I go to sleep hoping I won't get up anymore  but I know I will. I know I built a prison and that I'm keeping myself in it  never getting better  never actually doing what I want. I know I'm just being dumb and stubborn  I know I'm dooming myself. But the best I can do is  every time something negative happens  to deceive myself I'm getting closer to the end I want to give myself. I don't have the energy  the courage  nor the wisdom to change. The leisure and the inertia are easier and tempting  the emptiness is comfortable.

Peace everyone  I honestly hope that none of these thoughts will ever cross the mind of anyone. If they do  I hope you're strong enough to overcome without giving them any attention. And if you're just too tired to argue with them... I hope you're able to do something with them  anything that makes things better. 

TBH  this is more r/venting than depression  but I hope the messages here at least inspire other people.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ewcgrk/too_tired_and_disappointed_to_have_any_will_to/
depression,I want the problems to end. I want to give up.,"Lately  all I feel like doing is sleeping. Sleeping is the only time I can't feel physical or emotional pain.

I never feel like doing anything. I've struggled with depression for so many years now. I honestly don't see a way out. I don't see a life after depression for me. I feel like I'll just be alone and depressed until I die. In my worst moments  I feel like it'd be merciful if something happened to me. I don't want to go through any more suffering. I want it all to end.

I think I've went through so many problems that it's caused me to feel like I've been damaged by life. I don't know how to cope. How are you supposed to win in life when every card you've ever been dealt has worked against you and not in your favor?

I feel like no one will ever understand me. I feel like I will never be liked  let alone loved. Due to what I have going on with my body  I will probably end up being alone forever  and I think that prospect in and of itself has started to depress me.

I've never functioned well. I had depression at a young age (even before I was a teenager). I feel like I've experienced so many problems that I've become so worn down. People say that your twenties are supposed to be the best years of youe life or your prime. If this is my prime  I don't want to be around to experience it getting worse/declining because it's so bad already.

What should someone do if they're having a depressive episode?

I just want to sleep and not deal with anymore problems.

I feel like I'm unlovable due to all of the problems  like I have no worth. I feel like crying everyday lately. I'm just so depressed.

Also  I'm starting to wonder if I have no sense of self. Because I've had depression so long  is it possible that I don't even know who I am without depression?",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e92q4x/i_want_the_problems_to_end_i_want_to_give_up/

depression,I've spent 90% of my freetime in bed since I was 12,"As the title says I've been bedrotting since I was 12. I spend most of my time laying in my bed. I can't sit upright in chairs because my posture is only used to laying in bed. I enjoy eating in my bed. I feel safe in my bed.

When I was younger I didn't spend all my time in bed because I had friends and activities to do. I could sit upright in chairs without being in pain. I don't know how to live like that anymore. It's been almost a decade since  I'm not familiar with it.

For fun I crochet in bed. I draw in bed. I watch videos in bed. I get a dopamine rush when I think about all the fun things I could do with my life. I fantasize about how good I would have it if I had friends and didn't rot away in bed everyday.

I don't know if this is hope or delusion. I make an effort not to lay in bed all day sometimes. But usually it's just so comforting to lay in bed because every other alternative is so strange and unfamiliar.

People tell me to just get out of bed  but I'm split between wanting to and not wanting to. I don't know what I'm supposed to do when not in bed. I could do what I do in bed while sitting in a chair instead. But then my neck and back hurts.

I could go for walks but I'm so tired  and nobody wants to walk with me. I could go alone but then I might as well just be in bed. I don't feel like I exist when no one sees me. My life is on standby. I can just rot because no one will judge me.

Don't get me wrong though. I don't want to have it like this. I want to be normal and be able to make friends and enjoy life outside of bed. I just don't understand how I'm supposed to. And everytime I try I end up feeling worse. I want to turn back and out of this lifestyle but I don't know how to.

No one helped me in the start. Now it's so much harder. But I don't feel like I can reach out for help. Everyone has it so much worse than me. I have it easy compared to most. I have reached out for some help  but I don't think they understand.

When I have to get out of bed I get ready in the bathroom. I look very presentable. I don't look like someone who can't get out of bed for mundane tasks. Because I show up to my appointments on time  clean and groomed.

I can get out of bed for the tasks I understand. I understand taking a shower and going to the bathroom. I understand ""hanging out"" the few times it happens. I understand having to be somewhere at a certain time. I understand eating when I feel hungry.

But I don't understand preparing a meal for mealtime or brushing my teeth in the morning and evening. Most of the time I forget  and other times I tell myself I'll do it the next time I get out of bed  only to forget. I don't understand self respect and getting out of bed for my own good. I only get out of bed for others. Now when I don't have others I don't know what to do

Maybe I just stay in bed because I really really hate myself.

depression,I'm committing suicide (my suicide post that I'm posting in a few days),"By the time you read this  I will be dead. I don't think anyone will be surprised that I finally did it. Maybe that's the worst part of it all. I have made people so worried  but they won't have be worried that it will happen- because it with certainty did. I'm tired of being in pain all of the time  and I'm tired of being so lonely. People tell me that I am not alone  but I have been alone for a long time. 

  I have loved and will miss everyone that I have ever had in my life  but I am not sorry that I did this. I hope you will understand  but no one has really understood me in the first place  so it wouldn't be the first time.

  The funniest part of it all- is that I deserve this. I wish things would have ended up differently  but there's got to be a reason why I failed. I'm tired of distracting myself with video games  music  or some other thing. I'm tired of having to talk myself off the edge every time I feel like killing myself. I am a terrible person. Don't feel sad for me  because it's either live a long life of feeling like shit or cutting it short. 

  My therapist told me that I should be nicer to myself and be curious about life  but I can't do it it anymore. I deserve suicide. My mental health has already caused pain for the ones that left  but mostly for the ones that stayed to see me slowing die. And don't even get me started on all of the hospital bills- and I don't even feel any better. 

The fact is I'm sick of watching everyone have fun with their friends  spending weekends having fun  complaining about stupid shit like guys that don't love them or tests being hard. I used to be like that  and the pain of losing it all it too much to bare. I don't want to live a life as the ghost of the person I used to be. I'm terrified of spending my 21st birthday alone. I would rather be dead.

Don't say you didn't see this coming  because if you didn't  then you truly didn't know me at all. Donate my body to science. Peace out.

With love

Edit: It's been a few days since I posted this. I'm thankful for all of the comments and DMs. To give an answer to a few questions  I am in therapy  did reaching out (as I hinted   reaching out made me lose a lot of people and one person told me I was over sharing)  and I am on meds. Nothing in life seems worth it or interesting to me. I sometimes feel okay  but it is overweighted by emptiness  loneliness  and depression. Today was my stepdad's birthday  and I didn't want to ruin his birthday with my death  but it has passed. I still think I'm going to do it. I picked the building  and now it's just a waiting game. Or maybe I will buy a gun.

Edit: 2 months have passed. I am doing a lot better. My birthday passed and it was a great amount of fun. I'm not perfectly mentally healthy  but we are starting to want to live again.

Edit: 3 months have passed. I graduated college!! I also started Prozac in addition to my other meds  and that was really helpful. I reconnected with one of my best friends from high school  and it has been really nice to talk to her. I also tried animal crossing  so that's been my hyperfixation. Overall  I am doing a lot better  but there are still some rough spots.

Edit: 4 months have passed. I guess I might do this as kind of a journal. It's been helping me out- coming back to it and reading it. It's crazy because I read what I wrote 4 months ago  and I feel like I don't know that person anymore. I understand who she is and how much pain she was in  but I feel so far removed from that and it's amazing. I don't want this to sound like a success story because I still have really hard days and nobody's success story is going to help. But I digress. I still struggle with self-harm but I don't feel suicidal everyday like I used to. I am really doing well because it's the summer but also I have plans with new friends that I made. We plan on going on a camping trip in a couple of weeks so I'm super excited about that. I was hyperfixated on Animal Crossing for a little bit but I found two horror games that I really really like. I'm applying to jobs. I still haven't found one  but I hope that I'll find one eventually. I also met this guy right after I posted my last update. He is really cool  and he lives far away  but I'm going to meet him at the end of this month. I'm super excited! I don't want to rush into anything though obviously because I still have a long way to go with my health. I have been doing better in therapy and it's been helping me a lot more than it has been in a couple of years. Anyways that's all I have for today.

Edit: 5 months have passed. Hey guys  it is time to give another update. Thank you everyone for the continued kind messages. And for those who commented cruel things  I hope the best fot you as well. I found a good job that I am going to start in a few weeks; I am going to be working with children with special needs. I am nervous  but I am also excited! I never saw myself working with kids  but this is not what I want to do long term. I really want to get my PhD; it is my dream. I lost that dream before all this... I want to make it a reality. I am still struggling with self harm and big emotions  but I am doing good. You know that guy I talked about? Well... he is going to be here today! I am so excited to meet him in person! Welp.. anyways... I hope you guys are doing well... Much love <3",351,164,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ao0o5m/im_committing_suicide_my_suicide_post_that_im/
depression,Im begging somebody to read this I desperately need to feel like I have a friend there for me right now.,"Posting this on a few subs because I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve reached my breaking point. 


Im so tired. I’m so tired of existing. I’m so tired of being mad. I’m so tired of being tired. It’s pathetic. I’m a 25 year old adult who’s stuck living at home with my family. I can feel myself falling apart and I’m reaching the point where I’m finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life  or I’m going to end up cutting ties all together with my family  which is where I’ll probably sink. If it’s sink or swim out in the big world. 


I am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can’t cope with in a healthy way. My heart hurts so much but I’m such a glutton for punishment that I can’t bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate. And it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive. I’ll try and use brackets to section off my thoughts since I doubt anybody cares enough to actually read this all the way through. 



 {My thoughts on my father}

{{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C’s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework  not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall  and I remember my mother saying “well Don’t choke him (insert name)” and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying “I’m not choking him” I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up  he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. 

But you know. Now that I’m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I’m going to get my ass beat I’m going to get my ass beat. I’m just not living in fear anymore. }}}}


 {my thoughts on my brother}

{{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April  and as far as I’m concerned we probably won’t ever speak again. Let’s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work  because it was my job to “wake him up after rugrats” when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you’re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn’t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it  and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don’t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it  and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off  a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there’s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. 
When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he’s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend  because he was literally hitting either her  or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse “isn’t this okay because it’s what dad used to do to us. “ of course having a criminal record he couldn’t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour  gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year  finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she’s gone it’ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it’s not full time and “at your age your brother worked full time” at my age y’all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It’s just never going to be good enough. 


Let me talk about our most recent altercation  because it’s a fantastic transition into my mother  as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak  and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I’m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it.  I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn’t want to help which wasn’t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded “forget it” and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother’s defense I’m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty  meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don’t want to do something. 

Get to the warehouse work the shift  I leave at five  which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5:30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn’t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother.

Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn’t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn’t want to be around any of them. 


The next day comes and I don’t show up because not only did I not want to be there  but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said “we don’t know if we’ll need you tomorrow or not yet” so I just didn’t bother to show up because if y’all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn’t going to show up.  My brother comes home through the door doesn’t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up “why should I have to explain to my boss why you didn’t come” “why do you get to sleep all day while we work I’m sick of it” turning to my mother “I’m sick of him aren’t y’all sick of him” (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down  but I won’t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I’m running my mouth back in return  which is when he decided to put his hands on me  shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I’m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don’t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset.

(A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn’t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean  he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn’t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift  she said “well he wasn’t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.” I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I’m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system  and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She’s talking some I can’t I don’t have that kind of money  which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money  but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn’t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan.  So obviously I’m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it  only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don’t know what it was for  possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me  made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn’t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) 

Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of “you’re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation” to which he responds (talking out of his ass) “well you didn’t pay for it mom did!” Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there’s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}}

This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. 

 {my thoughts on my mother}

{{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I’m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own  spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I’m literally holding onto grudges that I don’t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I’m positive she’s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. 

A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I’m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes “are you ready now I’m not in a rush or anything” I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I’ll admit  like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I’m ready to go lol. Otherwise I’d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she’s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I’m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It’s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I’m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of “you’re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me” my response being “oh what I’m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???” which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don’t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don’t care if they’re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I’m not mad and you tell me “yes you are mad that’s why you’re being shitty” that’s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you’re just going to decide I’m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I’m in a bad fucking mood then. 

So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying “I hope something happens to your car  and when it does DONT call me”. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car  I’m inside of it  I hope it’s something fatal  and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won’t be screamed at in a car that I bought you  you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn’t kick me out when I was 16  and 18  and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don’t care about context with my car history

(Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him  one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn’t at fault for but still it’s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day.  I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn’t want a new car which I will explain why later. )

And then now just today  we are in another arguement because I think last night  my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he’s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn’t literally crying “mommy bail me out” when he’s in there. As he’s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me “your ashtray is knocked over “ as if i wasn’t outside and heard him kick it over like I’m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of “if he needs an ashtray he’ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.” Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. “Well it is your ashtray...” okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that’s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. 

In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she’s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I’ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is  I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn’t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there  and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. 

My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is  that because I don’t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don’t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more  which in turn causes me to always just feel like I’m chasing my mother’s approval or some shit. }}}}



 {thoughts on my own disgusting self}

It’s only been recently that I’m starting to come around to my father and that’s only because I think I’m starting to hate my mother. 


I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I’ve been and all that I’ve been given. But I don’t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. 


And that’s not to say I’m perfect either. I’ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. 

When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that’s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends  and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. 

But as an adult I can see that’s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay  because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it’s just who you are and can’t be changed  but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn’t sucking dick at five years old  would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing “doctor” with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That’s fucking gross we were all kids. 


Fast forward to me being in I think middle school  and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there  but I also wasn’t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly  but I also distinctly remember I wasn’t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don’t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me  but I know that I shouldn’t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that’s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why  but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. 

That’s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn’t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. 

But here’s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I’m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends  friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I’ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn’t me  despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension  and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we’re so sorry don’t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) 

It wasn’t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him  we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn’t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That’s another one that’s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. 

But since the recent heart break I’ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with  and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I’m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. 

I’m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me.

I’m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives  me personally  I don’t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don’t turn them into jokes. I’ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don’t want to be one anymore. 


I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did  then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. 



TLDR; I’m a scumbag. I’m starting to think my family is scumbags  and I’m genuinely losing my will to live. I’ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach.

depression,Nobody understands how difficult it is for me to simply get out of bed,"Everyone I know either blames me for 'choosing' to be depressed or cracks jokes about the fact that I sleep so much.

I wish people understood that depression isn't just 'feeling sad' but so much more. It deprives you of your passions  makes it difficult to concentrate  wears you out  makes you feel angry all the time for no reason  drains you of hope  etc. What's even worse though  is that I also struggle with a fuckton of anxiety. Panic attacks are almost a daily occurrence  along with intrusive thoughts and feelings of depersonalization.

I ask those questions because I'm looking for hope. I try not to make them sound negative but they'll always get downvoted. That makes me feel like I'm not allowed to hear something wholesome. It's like I'm being denied hope.

On this sub  it is normal for a post to have 2K upvotes  and stays 99% upvoted  if not 100%. Posts that don't take of  and only have 1 default upvote will usually stay 100% upvoted.

But anyway  I currently want to break up with her and then wait two years before killing myself so she doesn’t think it’s her fault :D but I can’t do it cause I’m such a coward  so I’m kinda always hoping she’ll do it for me. 

Should I just do it? It would be so shitty for her in the short term but I think better in the long term.

depression,Feeling like a burden,I live far away from my home and I have only one friend that I talk to  and my boyfriend. Whenever I feel extremely low and I have these panic episodes  I need to talk to someone. I call my boyfriend first  who I think does not help much. He is very busy and has his own issues. I love him a lot but long distance is so tough. He means well but it doesn’t help. The other friend talks to me  but there is a guilt when I talk to him. I think he is in love with me but I am not. And I feel like I am using him but I have no one else. He tries to help but gets overwhelmed himself. I also think he does not take what I feel seriously. None of these two get me.

depression,I feel like I’m in a death spiral,"
Good morning. Long rant here  so buckle up  if you’re interested.


Life has never dealt me the best hand. It’s always felt like one step forward  two steps back. There are still good days when the weight lifts a bit  and I can find some enjoyment. Im Glad I’m privileged enough to have parents who allow me to  stay at their house  even though I contribute to the rent (it’s only fair). and for my family members  like my sister who understands me better (even though I don’t tell her everything)  but unfortunately my parents don’t understand mental health. 

But many days if not most  I feel myself losing grip on reality  I lack the motivation to fight for or better myself. Many times  I have no motivation to even do the things I enjoy like playing a stupid video game. I'm amazed that I manage to get out of bed and go to work each morning  especially with the constant lack of sleep. It's almost a miracle. 

I often feel worthless and question if things will ever get better. It only seems to be getting worse. I feel like I've accomplished nothing in life  and all I've done is be a burden. I'm lost.

I struggle to see any good in myself. I dislike who I am and what I look like. My body  my teeth  and my condition including NF1 are constant reminders of my flaws. I’m a mess.

I still live with my parents  stuck in dead-end jobs  without a car or license. I have no real hobbies  just video games  doomscrolling  and too much pornography. I feel pathetic and believe I have no redeeming qualities. I'm insecure  unworthy of love and friendship  and struggled academically.

Loneliness exacerbates my feelings. While I have family  I haven't had face-to-face friends for over a decade  only one online friend whom I cherish and I’ve never experienced romantic love.

Although I'm not officially diagnosed  it sure feels like I'm battling depression and anxiety. I have episodes of panic  worthlessness  and hopelessness that leave me wanting to hide away from the world. I question if I’m overreacting or if my feelings are even valid.

I’m not suicidal  I don’t want to die and death is probably my greatest fear. But the intrusive thoughts of just “not existing” are there  always looming over me. I'm terrified that one day I’ll crash  and it's not a matter of if  but when.

I’m just really tired of it all. Why couldn’t I have been somebody else? Fuck me  man…

A part of me didn’t want to post this but another just needed to throw out to get something off my chest. 

I just don’t  know what to do  it’s all so overwhelming.

I have always tried to be successful or do the things that successful students/people do  but no matter the awards or accolade  no one has ever been there to tell me 'good job'. 

I know I have a low self-esteem. I know that I shouldn't feel this way. I know I should be nice to myself or be a friend to myself but I don't know how to do those things. I can't even given myself a compliment in my head  let alone out loud to myself.

mentalhealth,My words drove my girlfriend to a suicide attempt,"I (20f) had an argument with my (21f) gf yesterday and I ended up saying some very mean things to her out of anger  I told her i was sick of her and basically implied i would leave her. I realized what I had done and went to apologize 20minutes after i said these things. However it seemed like she had been drinking heavily during the argument and when I texted her again she wasn't spelling anything correctly   I pretty much couldnt make out anything she was saying   but i was able to make out the words ""arm"" and ""ambulance"" so i called her immediately. she was crying out loud begging me to go see her saying she couldnt move or breathe and that she was bleeding. she lives a 1hr walk away from me so i was panicking because it would take me too long to get to her house and it was late at night. i hung up on her to tell her friend what was going on but when i called back again after like 2min her phone was off. 



after this i just immediately left the house to go see her. i couldnt call an ambulance because i didnt know what her exact home address was  she lives in a huge neighborhood with lots of houses that look the same and we've always went there together so i got lost for a bit trying to find it myself   my plan was to call an ambulance once i found her house but when i got there there were cops and they told me they had already taken her to the hospital and that she was alright. i wasnt in my right mind so i didnt even ask which hospital and refused to answer any question the cops asked  once i heard she was ok i left to go back home before it could get way too late. 



the next day it fucking hit me that i have no idea where she is   i have no idea who called the ambulance bc it wasnt me or the only other person who knew   her phone is still dead   she doesnt talk much to her family members so i dont have their numbers and i have no one to ask about her but thankfully a woman from the hospital she was in contacted me to tell me they were sending her to what is basically a mental asylum. i live in an extremely shitty country so the room they had put her in was a fucked up small room with just a bed in it  nothing else. it broke my heart to see her alone and scared in that hellhole covered in dried blood stains and lots of bandages wrapped around her arm. she's basically imprisoned  she's being treated in such an inhumane way that i dont even want to talk about and they said they would keep her in there for a while. 



i cant wrap my head around the fact that if i had never said those words this would've never happened. i cant believe that i could've lost the person i love the most over the fact i chose to be a mean bitch despite knowing how much her entire mental state depends on me and how scared she is of losing me. she tried to end her own life because she thought i was going to leave her. i have no idea how im supposed to live with this guilt   this has probably been the worst 24 hours of my life and i cant believe everything was normal just a day ago and now she's gonna lose her job and be treated like a psycho for the rest of her life just because of this. im in so much pain that i dont even have the words to describe it bc ive never been in this situation before. tomorrow i have to get in her house to get her phone and clothes and i dont know how ill react when i see her blood on the floor. i dont know how to deal with this and i have no one to rely on  please help me.",52,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1j614cs/my_words_drove_my_girlfriend_to_a_suicide_attempt/

mentalhealth,Overwhelming emotion. I'm new. I don't need this to explode.,"I have an increasingly serious... THING that's been developing since my early 20's. I hear or see things and they fill me with the emotion I believe they were intending  but it's too much.
LORE: I'm a 27yo M. I've been diagnosed with OCD  but with a caveat I don't remember or know if relevant. Im afraid to go see a doctor and i dont know why. Ive taken autism tests and have come back ""definitely on the spectrum"" despite me not ""feeling"" ""un-normal"" (I'm not trying to degrade mental illness and say it's 'lesser than'. I'm just scared and trying to put it in as plain of English as I can)
SCENARIO: Things have been affecting me too much more  by my standards  recently. For this I'll give a couple examples. I'm a fan of Sleater-Kinney  and a few days ago I listened to their song ""Little babies"" again for the first time in couple years. It sent me on an existential crisis of second wave feminism and the controversial and dichotomy ""role of 'the mother'"" I was constantly on the verge of tears and I don't know why. I cry  I feel  often enough  but some many things are pushing me towards that extreme of emotion regularly. The  other example is; I delivered something to a Walmart that was an employee appreciation BBQ out back near the delivery area. They had a company doing it and a bunch of Walmart employees were out there  getting their food. I asked an older ladies (maybe in her late 50's  early 60's) what was going on and they said ""it's because our accident calendar went past 100 days."" That's nothing! I should have just said ""Cool!"" Which I did. But I was overcome with a sense of dread. The same feeling I got after my 2nd and last trip of any hallucinogenic  where I'm sad and way to overly empathetic for this older person that I don't know  or know her circumstance  but I'm scribing a ""wasted life"" onto her for no reason  and it fills me with so much emotion that I need to disassociate  lest risk a panic attack. 
Am I just an asshole? Is this just was ""normal"" people go through and I'm just realizing it for the first time. It's ok if it is  I'm always trying to be a better person  but I'm so confused and scared.

Thanks to any person that replies to this. Know that it's only a little crisis and your word won't completely dictate my future actions.

But my father-in-law passed away in December  and my mother-in-law’s health has been declining ever since. We even moved to a new city just to be closer to her.

Today  my wife had an emotional breakdown  and I feel guilty. I feel like I should be able to support her more  but no matter what I do  it never seems enough. At the same time  I feel like I’m drowning in work. I feel stuck  like I’m not growing as a person  and I don’t even know what I should do or feel at this point.

I’m angry  sad  and alone. I don’t have any friends here either  so I have no one to talk to. I feel like I should just deal with it on my own  but I also know I’m reaching my limit.

At my job  I have access to a psychologist  but only one person can see them. My first thought was to let my wife have the sessions—after all  if I don’t put her first  what kind of husband would I be? But at the same time  I don’t know how much longer I can carry everything without breaking down myself.",8,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1j3uwwc/am_i_failing_as_a_husband_i_feel_overwhelmed_lost/
mentalhealth,Overwhelming my husband,I am diagnosed with PTSD among a few other things. My husband has known and I have been very straightforward about my mental health from the beginning of our relationship. He is the kindest man and handles it very well as far as I could tell  but after living together for almost a year I can tell it’s wearing him down. He started to see a therapist on his own  and keeps trying to reassure me that it’s not my fault  even though he only started seeking therapy after I had a particularly bad breakdown two weeks ago. It’s gotten to the point where he is afraid to go on deployment leaving me home alone for 6-9 months. I try to reassure him that I’ll be okay but he’s convinced that it wouldn’t be safe. I’m tired of bleeding my problems out all over him  he always tells me that that’s what he’s here for  and he loves me all the same. Now that it’s becoming painfully obvious that my mental health is affecting him I’m not sure what to do. Should I start masking and keeping my feelings from him to protect him? He’s sinking into a pit of depression that I led him into  and I feel so guilty.,101,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/178elbk/overwhelming_my_husband/

mentalhealth,How do I keep the voices from overwhelming her?,"This is all new to me and my gf  it's been about 2 months. 2 horrible  sad  terrifying  hopless months with the voices. Recently my gf found out she has bipolar II and that it's what's causing her to auditory hallucinations. For the most part she's able to keep the voice to the back of her mind during the day  but at night  night is when it can get down right scary for her. 95% of the time the voices take on the sound of the parents. The voices could sound muffled like it's happening from the other room  other times the voices are moving in all directions circling her like pray  and in bad times they are screaming (the volume amplifies when she tries to ignore them with head phones.). 

Most nights she's in the fetal position shaking even if and when she does fall asleep her body will still be shaking. I'm seeing this all unfold before me every day and every night  there's nothing worse then seeing the person u love most going through such agony that she wishes for death  and m knowing there's nothing I can do to take it way. I do the best I can I really do. I'm trying to learn what I can about bipolar  I listen to her  reasure her that what she is hearing isn't happening  I hold her till she stops crying  I try to make her smile  keep her distracted  I wake up at the drop of the hate if she needs anything  when I can tell she's having nightmares I kiss her and whisper it's okay I'm here. I don't sleep that well anymore cause I'm waking up cause I hear her crying or she wakes me up cause she's scared.

 Majority of the time she doesn't want me to sleep she feels better hearing that I'm awake playing fortnite lol. Luckily I'm not going about this all alone  her wonderful cat Cheeto a literal angel and one of the best souls on this planet has been helping me and sometimes it's a tag team effort. When I'm not home for whatever reason he handles her very well sometimes with better success than me at times. When she's dissociating and just completely gone from her body he will walk up to her reach out and tap her on the shoulder  press his head into her arm. When she's in bed he will lay on her chest and apply pressure  if she's hitting herself he's comes and gets her to pet him instead. 

He was never taught this behavior but just new instinctually that she needed him. Sometimes when it's at its worst I'm holding her and cheetoes rubbing up on her and/or sitting on her she will eventually feel safe and calm down. I seriously fear the day he dies  It will completely destroy her and I feel I might lose her. She's seeing Drs but she's trying to find others cause they are not a good fit  the medication she's been trying isn't working they don't listen or try other medication. She often says she feels she running out of time and I'm just fucking scared for her  I just want her happy and to have whatever normalcy she can possibly have. This is just a summary  there's been a lot more and worse things that have happened because of this.So all that to ask what tips or tricks does anyone have to help manage the voices or distract from them?",1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1j6x35b/how_do_i_keep_the_voices_from_overwhelming_her/
mentalhealth,Mental paralysis/overwhelm from too many interests - what to do?,"Hey all. This post is mental health related from the standpoint of stress/anxiety/overwhelm and impulsivity. I have bipolar and cPTSD  also diagnosed w GAD. I have a lot of different interests and want to pursue them all. The problem is  is that I have so many that I get overwhelmed/paralyzed and shut down completely… And then I either don’t do any of them. Or I will start many many things and will not fully follow through with any of them. In the process of starting those many many things I will sometimes spend a LOT of money on them bc I’m feeling so inspired…And then I get distracted by another interest and don’t actually use what I bought for the previous interest etc. And then I feel really badly about myself and ashamed.

I don’t really know how to manage this behavior. I really do want to pursue all of my interests and I know that it is not possible… but how do I keep my focus and actually finish what I start? Like really commit even though my brain is in a million other places  wanting to do a million things simultaneously sometimes? And control the impulse to spend hundreds of dollars I don’t have on things I don’t follow through with?

mentalhealth,Phone addiction it's been really killing me and i need help...,"( |TW:depression| I know for these kinds of things you would hire a psychiatrist or something  but sadly that isn't an option for me for reasons i cannot really share.I just want to find alike experienced people and what was their way out.)

Phone addiction it's been really killing me for EXTREMELY long time  and i feel like i mentally just can't keep up with myself and neither with this.It started when i was young and it developed as more time passed throughout my life and since i was pretty lonely kid my phone it's been the only thing that was there to keep me company and as someone might guess that slowly grew into addiction which just turned into depression.And now im stuck in a life i don't want for myself that i cannot just leave because it grew too much into my being and core and besides that it's the only thing i have really.

Now yeah i know that most people would currently suggest just blocking all apps and use phone for what phones are usually meant to and maybe do some hobby i always wanted or get some work done.But the thing is i really don't have anything outside of it no friends whom i can hang out with no hobbies besides writing my mind out on a pice of paper and certainty no sports where i do something.Yes my whole day just revolves around laying around besides when i have to go to school but i never wanted that and on several occasions i've tried to change but i just can't.I watched every motivational video and ones about how to leave the phone read everything online yet my mind just refuses to do what i want it to do and i truly feel hopeless.

Funny thing about this is that i want to become a video editor but i easily just drift out on tik tok meanwhile trying to find content and inspiration as well as material to work with and my phone addiction with that hobby clearly doesn't align at all which is just cherry on top.If anyone had this problem i would like to hear what you did against all odds that im currently facing and i would be so grateful if it works because my attention span along with rot i received with this stupid device is just too strong for me tho i am willing to cooperate.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1j8dfw3/phone_addiction_its_been_really_killing_me_and_i/

Initially it happened randomly but then it's started happening regularly because I really wanted it to happen and the scenarios are nothing nsfw and are mostly in my control. 
But now I am starting to face problems in achieving this so I started to check what was my situation and did some research about it and found out that if I relax myself and listen to some static in a dark place I'll get the scenarios playing. But then I stumbled upon a post which were about hallucinations  and upon some research i realised  that I was indeed hallucinating. And as a fact I know that hallucinations are bad and I don't want any mental illness. But I can't resist without these.

His dad left early in his life and it affected him badly. He turned to drugs and got in with the wrong crowd  which left him in a really tough place. He randomly messaged me after around 8 years of no contact.

I've had my challenges too  but he reached out to ask me if I could help him and give him some advice on 'how to be happy again'.

I told him getting help for his drug addiction was the first step  but he said he already had that arranged. Then he asked me to just give him as many tips as I could think of that have made me happy. What decisions have I made to help me live a fairly happy life (most days).

I struggled with this at first  but then I decided to treat it like making a Youtube video (the think I like doing most) which made is a lot easier.

[You can check the video out here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p0X0lfnWHM) if you want  but here is the list below which may be easier.

1. Declutter  clean and systemise your personal space
2. Use an online diary to free up your mind and memory
3. Take more risks as happiness is often on the other side of risk
4. Try and do work that you love
5. Give yourself the grace to fail and fall forward
6. Wear stupid clothing to train yourself to not care what people think
7. Simplify making better decisions. And harder to make bad decisions.
8. Only buy things that bring you joy.
9. Make time to love yourself and treat yourself like someone you care about.

Hopefully these tips help someone else too :)",3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1hgdd82/i_helped_my_drugaddicted_friend_turn_his_life/
mentalhealth,WE ARE IN A OPIOID CRISIS the day that we start treating addiction like the mental disorder is will be the day millions of people will get help in their battle,First of all if you’ve never been addicted to opioids you could never understand. After a certain amount of time it changes your brain chemistry and you no longer think the same. Your brain significantly loses dopamine and serotonin adding even more so to the mental disorder . Would you say “just be normal” to a person with autism? Then don’t say “just stop using” to an addicted person. It is a disorder a physical and mental disorder. Unless you’ve ever experienced it you will never understand just like I would never understand what it’s like to have autism! Most people in the US have used opioids whether it was prescribed from a doctor for a c section or for dental reasons. After using opioids for a certain period of time your body and brain WILL become reliant on it and you will have a new addiction disorder especially in the majority cases where people where prescribed it by doctors and that is guaranteed!   So just like you would never shame an autistic person for having a mental disorder bc you would never understand don’t shame an addicted person they have a mental disorder too!,7,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ufv62z/we_are_in_a_opioid_crisis_the_day_that_we_start/

Hi everyone I’m a 22F and I don’t even know why I’m posting this  but I guess I just need to put it somewhere. I’ve never felt this alone in my life.

I struggle with my mental health already  and I don’t want to keep leaning on the few people I have—I feel like I’m just exhausting them.

But the truth is  I really  really just want friends. I want people to talk to  to laugh with  to feel like I exist in the world outside these four walls. Instead  every day feels the same  and I’m just here  invisible  while life moves on without me.

I’ve had a bad childhood and teenage years. I was sexually assaulted and abused multiple times by a cousin (lives in the same house) around age 7. I’ve been diagnosed with CPTSD and bipolar disorder. My friends in school abandoned me all of a sudden one day and told me that nobody wants me around in a very rude manner. They wouldn’t even walk next to me  as if I was an invalid. My parents have emotionally neglected me all my life. They still do it.

I now crave connection so bad yet I feel as if I am all alone and nobody sees me. As if I’m invisible. Everyone looks at me but they don’t see me. I’m always so alone  even with people around me. I do have friends now but I don’t feel that they truly want to be there. It feels like a forced engagement on their part. Even the person I like romantically doesn’t want me.

My family doesn’t see me  nor my friends  nor the person I like. Why am I so alone? I shouldn’t be when I’ve got people around! I always come back to this void no matter how much I try to work on it.

mentalhealth,Intellectual Loneliness Is The Saddest Form Of Isolation,"Have you ever felt like no one truly understands the way you think? Not just in a ""no one gets me"" kind of way  but in a deep  fundamental sense—like your thoughts operate on a completely different wavelength from those around you?

It’s not about being smarter than others; it’s about craving conversations that go beyond the surface level—discussing philosophy  abstract concepts  or life’s deeper questions—only to find that most people either don’t care or don’t understand. You ended up being alienated. You try to explain your thoughts  but they either get dismissed or met with blank stares. Over time  you stop sharing  realizing it’s easier to keep your mind to yourself than to constantly feel misunderstood.

It’s an isolating experience. You can be surrounded by people  yet feel completely alone. Small talk feels exhausting  and the rare moments of connection—when you finally meet someone who resonates with your ideas—feel fleeting. You wonder if it’s even possible to find true intellectual companionship.

People like Nietzsche  Albert Einstein  Nikola Tesla  Allan Turing  Isaac Newton; almost all of the people who have intellectual trait suffered isolation due to their odd thinking and beliefs.

Society doesn’t acknowledge loneliness especially this kind of loneliness. If you lack social connections  people sympathize. But if you’re intellectually alone  they assume you’re just weird or overly complicated. They don’t see that this kind of isolation eats away at you  making the world feel smaller and more disconnected. This type of loneliness feels like you're drowning.

However it seemed like she had been drinking heavily during the argument and when I texted her again she wasn't spelling anything correctly   I pretty much couldnt make out anything she was saying   but i was able to make out the words ""arm"" and ""ambulance"" so i called her immediately. she was crying out loud begging me to go see her saying she couldnt move or breathe and that she was bleeding. she lives a 1hr walk away from me so i was panicking because it would take me too long to get to her house and it was late at night. i hung up on her to tell her friend what was going on but when i called back again after like 2min her phone was off. 



after this i just immediately left the house to go see her. i couldnt call an ambulance because i didnt know what her exact home address was  she lives in a huge neighborhood with lots of houses that look the same and we've always went there together so i got lost for a bit trying to find it myself   my plan was to call an ambulance once i found her house but when i got there there were cops and they told me they had already taken her to the hospital and that she was alright. i wasnt in my right mind so i didnt even ask which hospital and refused to answer any question the cops asked  once i heard she was ok i left to go back home before it could get way too late. 



the next day it fucking hit me that i have no idea where she is   i have no idea who called the ambulance bc it wasnt me or the only other person who knew   her phone is still dead   she doesnt talk much to her family members so i dont have their numbers and i have no one to ask about her but thankfully a woman from the hospital she was in contacted me to tell me they were sending her to what is basically a mental asylum. i live in an extremely shitty country so the room they had put her in was a fucked up small room with just a bed in it  nothing else. it broke my heart to see her alone and scared in that hellhole covered in dried blood stains and lots of bandages wrapped around her arm. she's basically imprisoned  she's being treated in such an inhumane way that i dont even want to talk about and they said they would keep her in there for a while. 



i cant wrap my head around the fact that if i had never said those words this would've never happened. i cant believe that i could've lost the person i love the most over the fact i chose to be a mean bitch despite knowing how much her entire mental state depends on me and how scared she is of losing me. she tried to end her own life because she thought i was going to leave her. i have no idea how im supposed to live with this guilt   this has probably been the worst 24 hours of my life and i cant believe everything was normal just a day ago and now she's gonna lose her job and be treated like a psycho for the rest of her life just because of this. im in so much pain that i dont even have the words to describe it bc ive never been in this situation before. tomorrow i have to get in her house to get her phone and clothes and i dont know how ill react when i see her blood on the floor. i dont know how to deal with this and i have no one to rely on  please help me.",49,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1j614cs/my_words_drove_my_girlfriend_to_a_suicide_attempt/
mentalhealth,instead of being put into a mental health ward and restrained for being suicidal  people who are at risk of suicide should be allowed to go to a place where they can eat free ice cream while talking to social workers,and then depending on how they feel they can sleep there and eat more ice cream the next day. can go back home anytime after that.,603,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/xpqjlj/instead_of_being_put_into_a_mental_health_ward/

mentalhealth,I want to kill myself,I am now unemployed. I am now single. I am extremely ugly and get blocked when women ask me what I look like. I am no longer able to produce songs (my life time dream)  I am struggling to afford my monthly payments  and I feel like all I do is disappoint every single person around me. All I want to do is go to the store tomorrow and buy helium and consume so much of it that I pass away. I have battled suicide for most of my life and every time I start to get better  stuff comes back but even worse than before. The only thing thats pushes me away from commiting suicide is the thought of going to hell because of the action. I don't mean to bring religion into this but I have mixed feelings about Christianity. I want to kill myself so I can stop suffering on this planet. But I know if the chance of it all being real  hell would be much worse. but if i knew that it wasn't. I would much rather move forward with my thoughts.

mentalhealth,I've been super withdrawn  depressed & spaced out my whole life? I can't find my passion & feel socially separate from everyone (social anxiety) yet when I can connect I LOVE being around people. Help? What's going on?,"Please read...



eg. I went to film school because I thought I was passionate about cinematography but when I got there I felt so lazy and wouldn't turn up most days and I just felt really passive like I was letting the world happen to me & not assertive at all. 

I couldn't connect & most of all I find it hard to connect & relate to others. I just feel really socially distant and spaced out all the time.

  
But I'm confused because does this mean that cinematography wasn't my passion after all or is it just because of mental illness (I've had this my whole life.. does this mean I have to find introverted quiet things to do rather than chasing passions? eg. i felt myself drawn to video editing because I didn't have to interact... but thing is when I can connect & feel present (rarely).. more than anything I LOVE being around people.. I adore it.. infact it's my favourite thing in the world - contradiction).

  
I tried acting but couldn't express myself & was frozen up due to anxiety.. people said it just seemed like I wasn't trying. I don't understand why I'm this way.



This feels really unfair if it's all just a part of me. I've tried antidepressants over 6 years. The thing is I don't seem to have any major trauma but this all started from 2 years old? I went selectively mute for a few years infact.



 I'm majorly emotional  and setbacks can knock me back for years.. I'm really weak and sensitive.



(I'm having a bit of an identity crisis at 27 :( )



I do have social anxiety and have done my whole life. I just HATE that I'm so separate from others.. when when I can make myself feel ok which is rare I LOVE being around people & making conenctions.. it brings me so much energy and joy.. I have no connections anymore or friends and I just stay at home all day.

  
Please help bring me some guidance. I feel like no one understands me. I just want to be able to feel passion  and connect and be happy being around people consistently without being spaced out or getting burnt out from the depression & anxiety and whatever else is going on.",4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1f35u8i/ive_been_super_withdrawn_depressed_spaced_out_my/
mentalhealth,it feels like my brain is going haywire. constant stream of agitated nonsensical thoughts  can't concentrate on anything  thinking about the fact that I'm thinking.,"this started a few days ago. I'm constantly thinking about the fact that I'm thinking and constantly have random thoughts and images and sounds going through my head   it feels like I'm in a room with a bunch of stereos and tvs blasting different things at the same time.
im barely able to function and I'm constantly thinking of a way to stop the thinking  which makes the thinking worse. im not able to concentrate on any conversation or task  if I try my brain start going like ""you are doing this task. you are doing this task. you are doing this task. don't think about other things *intrusive thought* do the task. *random song lyric* it truly feels like I'm going crazy  this is happening all at once.
I'm anorexic and have started recovery this past week so maybe that's why? I've been trying to do a lot of thinking on the way that I think about food and how to stop thinking about it in a certain way and trying to hyper analyze every bodily sensation and thought I have  and I think I might have broken my brain somehow? like by trying to perform surgery on it and forcing my thoughts to change. but now idk what to do. it feels like my brain is a tightly wound knot and the more I think about how to unravel it the more it tightens. ive been told I should try to distract myself. I can't. I try listening to music and my brain start thinking about the fact that I'm listening to music and spewing a bunch of random thoughts and images that make 0 sense  or intrusive thoughts about food  or panicked thoughts about this situation  trying to think of ways to stop it  things I could do to stop it  ways I could bend my thoughts to make them stop  it's like a state of being both hyperconcious and zombie-like at the same time. I don't know what to do  I feel like I need a lobotomy it's getting worse every day  and the more research I do about it the worse it gets. but I can't stop because it's the only thing I can focus on. this feels like hell and I feel like I'm reinforcing it somehow. like I'm making it worse by thinking that it's getting worse and it's a constant spiral. it feels like something broke inside my brain.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d0h9b8/it_feels_like_my_brain_is_going_haywire_constant/
mentalhealth,Sometimes I say things I can't control  what's going on?,"Sometimes I say the phrase ""I'm going to kill myself"" involuntarily. I'm unable to stop myself from saying it  and even I'm not aware I'm going to say it. I'm usually not even thinking anything NEAR wanting to kill myself in that moment  and yet- it's like my voice and mouth are moving completely disconnected from my brain. This is usually followed up with a ""What? No!"" Or ""what do you mean?"" These are also generally involuntarily  but they tend to vary a little. It's ALWAYS ""I'm going to kill myself"" in the same tone and same wording. Occasionally I'll involuntarily speak about other subjects  usually how (I guess) I expect a conversation to go with someone  but I still don't have control over it. Normally though  it sticks to short sentences like ""God!"" Or ""God damn it"" or ""WHAT!"" or ""I don't think so."" Again  these are NEVER reactions to what I'm thinking  feeling  or doing at the time- unless it's a coincidence. I'm not especially worried about this  as I'm lucky I have friends who understand  but it DOES get annoying  so I'm trying to figure our what's going on and how to stop it- I'm working in sales now and I absolutely CANNOT be having an outburst like that around customers 😭",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cy1b97/sometimes_i_say_things_i_cant_control_whats_going/

mentalhealth,Symptoms of stress and depression  mental block on getting older  can't imagine myself in the future with children  feeling like an empty shell and emotionally disconnected from myself  watching life go by on the side line  feeling like I don't care if I wake up tomorrow or not,"TLDR: 

I felt anger and resentment with my old job through a long time  got a new one that should be the solution. It turned out to be worse. Simultaneously my (M30) GF (F28) brought having children up which is a life altering decision. I have now switched job again for the better  but the consequences are here. I have symptoms of stress and depression and feel like an empty shell. I feel like my brain is melting when trying to process thoughts about the future  what having children will be like  getting older and generally see myself in the future. I have no motivation and do not feel a drive. 

I am aware of my existence but I feel like I am watching my own life from the side line. I am aware of my actions when doing something but feel like I am watching myself do it on the sideline  like the outside of myself is a shell walking around on auto pilot with the real me stuck inside  not knowing what to do. I feel sad and empty. All memories feel like they were in a different life and with a different me  and I don't feel like I am getting older and haven't done for a long time. My brain feels like it is melting down when I try to process thoughts of the future. 

The most relatable is to really really trying hard to imagine that the Universe is infinite. It simply isn't possible to comprehend that thought. Sometimes I feel like I just don't care if I wake up tomorrow  and not being scared of that thought scares me. 

Post:

I hope that some of you might have the time to provide some input. I moved away from my family to a different city to study when I was 19. Initially I wanted to move back as soon as possible  but I kept pushing the moving date because I started liking the new city. Got a lot of friends and generally enjoyed it there. I eventually told myself I would move back when I graduated. 

During my time at University  I met my now GF. We moved in together a year later and every was fine. When I graduated  she was a few years behind me graduation-wise  and even though I initially wanted to move back  and after many long and not very fun discussions with her  I ultimately decided to stay in the new city to be with her and to be close to the many friends I gained  figuring I could visit family over the weekends while being close to friends at daily basis. This has turned out great. 

Fast forward a few years and I joined a company that I thought equalled my dream job. It was perfect for a long time  until I started being overworked with 50-60 hour weeks on an ongoing basis. For almost a year I tried raising a flag  saying I had too much to do  but nothing happened. I started resenting the job so much that I refused to work more than I absolutely had to and ultimately resigning to start a new job. The new job should be the solution  however this turned out worse on the other end of the scale. 

I had absolutely nothing to do  they did now own up to agreements agreed upon during interviews  the department wasn't very welcoming and thus I was left to myself quite quickly. This is where symptoms of depression started with being much quieter  generally sad and miserable and not enjoying my time at all. Eventually I was a state where I would break down crying several times a week  and realizing something was seriously wrong  I went to a doctor (my tests showed stress symptoms and a symptoms of a moderate depression  which is between a light and severe) and afterwards a therapist. 

However  this has done nothing. Nothing at all. I feel empty inside and as if I have no emotions. I don't really feel any joy or happiness. My body is facade and I am trapped inside on autopilot. It is almost like I have a separate brain that is aware of everything my initial brain thinks  but the second one is not really a part of the initial one. I am aware of my actions  my thoughts  plans and so on  but I do not really feel a part of them. I feel like it is a parallel me doing those things  and the real me is stuck inside. 

When I talk to the therapist  I am aware of that  but I feel like I am watching myself talking to the therapist and not talking myself. Having an entirely different background  I feel like therapy could just as easily be witchcraft in a way where the therapist can tell me what he wants  how am I to judge or asses that. But using the input on myself and relating to my world  I just can't. I can't see how on earth talking to him will make the rest go away. 

I can't comprehend thoughts of the future. My brain just stops working. Thinking back  I don't feel like I have aged at all either. I don't feel my age or that I am getting older and my brain melts down when trying to accept the fact that I will be 40 and 50 and 60 etc. someday. I simply can't imagining it. 

I can't imagine what a life with children will be like  because it is such a life altering event. Having a baby is one thing  but to think ahead and imagining myself with 15 year old children. My brain simply can't process those thoughts. I think I do want children. I am quite sure. I think I would be pretty sure if I didn't want children  i.e. It's not so much the children as it is the fact that I can't seem to think or process the thoughts of having them. My GF brings them up once in a while  asking about my thoughts on having them but by no means want to pressure me. We are in a healthy financial state  so that is not an issue. Actually  by all objective criteria  we are ready.

I just have no motivation and feel so detached from myself that I can't really describe how. It's frustrating and saddening. I know that you only get one life  but I am not enjoying mine. I am in no way suicidal  but from time to time I do think that if I wouldn't wake up tomorrow  I wouldn't really care  because why should I. The fact that the thought of not waking up doesn't scare me  scares me. 

I do talk to my GF about it and she is really supportive  however there is only so much she can do. I still get sad and cries from time to time without being able to say exactly why. It is not a fun state to be in and I can't see how it can change  and im not really sure when it started  only that it is a somewhat foggy mental state I'm in.

mentalhealth,I feel like it's too late for me. My life is over. I can't go on like this. I have no will to live anymore.,"Just now  some old friends called me after a long long time and I decided to socialise because my therapist suggested it and we met up.


 I was silent most of the time because I genuinely had nothing to share while I was bamboozled by the things they are experiencing and living. The relationships  travel  friends  partying drinking  stories.... It's like a whole Commotion is going on outside and I spent most of my adult life living my life without any of these experiences and making connections and dealing with my mental health and my situation.

 I knew that things like this are happening and it did bothered me seeing them on social media but I dealt with it and I avoided them for a while too. But hearing firsthand was a different kind of heartbreak. I'm 22 M and I'm supposed to be living my life except I lived a miserable life and I can already see that I will be living a miserable life for the rest of my life. 

I began socially isolating myself a lot back when I felt I don't belong anywhere and no one can understand me. I have always wanted to go to Europe and I thought it will end all my problems. 
But now I know that it won't and also I know that I won't be able to make it because of the stupid major I took and my mental health. 


Everyone liked me in college. They would talk to me. I was the one who refused to make a deep connection.

I have to do a PG in biology but I can't even bring myself to study it and even if I studied it  job prospects doesn't look good. I just want to die. 


Now  the fact that how alone I'm really hit me. 


I never felt belonged in this world. It's either one issue or another. Now  it's like I was left behind. I have nothing going on in my life and I have nothing to look forward to. All I see is a miserable existence. My teenage years went past by without any special memories but it was okay but now my youth too. 

I'll never be comfortable with life. I'll be miserable my whole life. I wish my family hated me because then I can finally go through with it without worrying about them. 

I'm surrounded by people but I feel lonely. I'm invisible. I wish I can just disappear. 

I don't see anything good happening in foreseeable future.

I am virtuous and genuine and want to help everyone solve all their problems but I'm also devious and deceitful and will play on things to get my way. Doing good things make me genuinely happy but the only reason I'm not more of a Villian is because jail terrifies me.

mentalhealth,Feel like my life is meaningless and I have zero motivation,"I'm a 27-year-old man who just earned my bachelor's degree after three years of hard work. However  now that I've completed my studies  I find myself feeling stuck in a repetitive  dull  and unmotivated routine. Life feels pointless and meaningless—not in a depressive or harmful way  but simply lacking excitement or purpose. Some friends have suggested that getting a girlfriend might help give me motivation  but I just can't find the drive to pursue a relationship. After being alone for 27 years  I've grown accustomed to this lifestyle.

Is there anyone who can help me or provide recommendations on things I can do to get my life back on track. Thank you ",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1j8i5ft/feel_like_my_life_is_meaningless_and_i_have_zero/
mentalhealth,I feel like life is meaningless and I am considering ending my life,"I am 25 years old old guy (| dont even consider myself a guy  just a little boy inside this shell of a body. am autistic and very bad with people and forming and maintaining relationships  never had a girlfriend who could love me  used to love a girl  we were together and she had a crush on me but once told her that love her she said that she doesn't love me and wants to stay friends.
Now am working a job in an office and i just stay inside computer rooms all day 24/7. feel life is meaningless and one day we all are going to die. am also going to die one way or another so why should wait for the natural death when can end it right now because do not get joy from life  people are shit and back bitters.

mentalhealth,My life is meaningless to me,"Essentially the title. I don't see any purpose in my life anymore.
Many years ago  when I had some ""bad moment""  I used to think that I didn't want to die before having accomplished something meaningful; I wanted to die with the awareness that I had done more good than bad in my life  I didn't want to leave before having this certainty. So I tried my best for years. I tried to connect more with people  I tried to be always very kind and supportive with anyone and I really gave all myself to the people I loved... And I am alone now.
Sometimes people tell me I am a good person  but still they don't want my presence in their life. I think that if I would die today  no-one would miss me. My parents and sister surely would cry  but  honestly  that's not enough for me; I don't think I've really done anything to deserve their love. I mean  parents often love their children even if they are asshole  so...
And at this point I don't know what else to do  and I start to feel tired of trying my best for nothing. I am 27  almost 28  and I haven't make even the smallest difference for the world  and I cannot see the point to live this life.",2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ymrabp/my_life_is_meaningless_to_me/

mentalhealth,life is starting to feel meaningless,i have no close family except my dad who’s very absent and negative to me. i rarely get signs of affection from him. one of my siblings are in jail and the other moved out. and my mom is a fraud addict schizophrenic and she’s never been consistent in my life. i also struggle with serious motivational issues and some days i don’t even leave bed and sometimes it gets to the point where i pee myself. i was also supposed to graduate soon but i never went to school enough to do it and their was a point where i loved school but even though i was doing the work unlike my siblings they still got treated better and it just made everything feel so worthless. i also had friends but i overall felt left out and none of them were ver there for me when i needed it yet when they were struggling with mental health i didn’t hesitate to be there and give advice or to defend them yet i never got the same treatment. and i really only consider myself to have 1 friend since i cut contact with my old friend group since realizing a lot of things. and even in high school i was never able to do extra curricular activities because my dad couldn’t afford it and i had no transportation since my dad had to work all day. and i’ve tried to get therapy but either they didn’t understand or they were overly optimistic saying things will get better and trying to provide solutions like i haven’t been fucken dealing with it since sixth grade it just feels invalidating and it makes me feel like my life isn’t going to get better since i’ve never in my life been consistently happy. and i used to cope by thinking about the future and how i’ll never have to deal with this anymore after i’m on my own and i can make new friends and start a new life but how am i supposed to live when i can’t even get up to go pee and when literally nothing in this world is keeping me from wanting to be here anymore. plus having to work all my life to carry the middle and rich class like that’s so fucken depressing. i relapsed on self harm today and ending my life has been as tempting as ever. i honestly feel like my lie is set for failure and it’s a joke to see how long i can last in this horrible world. and it’s working apparently since the only thing i have to vent to is this reddit channel. i’m only 17 and i don’t feel like if i’ll make it to 18.,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/uqmiff/life_is_starting_to_feel_meaningless/

mentalhealth,My life is meaningless. I have no direction.,"I’m 29. I make 20k a year. I live with my parents  who have never charged me rent. I pay for all my stuff except the actual place to live. 

My brother is severely mentally handicapped. He is 40  but mentally he is no older than 2. Even if I could move out  my parents would be left with a huge burden since everything we do has to be scheduled around someone being at the house with him. 

This is why me living at home feels so natural for us I guess  and also why they don’t charge me rent of any sort. 

Forming relationships is hard due to my social anxiety  and people just not understanding the situation. I have to ask before I do anything  but people interpret that as me asking permission from my parents the way a child does  when in fact I’m just making sure I’m in the clear  and not needed for that time. Otherwise  my parents know I’m an adult and don’t care how I spend my time. Our normal isn’t everyone else’s normal. 

I recently spoke with a woman. I understood her. She understood me. But I ended things before they picked up because I knew it wouldn’t work. She was on a trajectory for big things in life while I was going to hold her back. I can’t have anything good it seems. Especially when it comes to other people. I’be gotten to where I feel complete and while when I’m alone. 

I love my brother. Don’t think I’m treating him as some tumor on my life. I’d do anything for my parents and for him  and have gladly stayed at home with him so they can take care of what they need to. I’ve dressed him  fed him  bathed him  helped him in the bathroom  given him his medicine  put him to bed and woken him up  I’ve done everything. And I’ll do more. And as unpleasant as it seems I thought maybe I could embrace it. I’d ache and pine for a better life  but at least I can say “this is my purpose”. And no one could tell me I didn’t have things figured out. 

But I’m not allowed that. I’m not allowed to settle for less. Every Christmas and Thanksgiving I have to hear from my boomer uncle  *Why aren’t you married? Why don’t you buy a house? Why don’t you start a business? What’s wrong with you?* you’d think family of all people would understand. But they don’t. 

I’m tired. I’m very tired. I want. I don’t want. I need. I don’t need. I don’t know what I’m supposed to think of my own life.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/t9kc8l/my_life_is_meaningless_i_have_no_direction/
mentalhealth,Is it possible i have lost all interest in life because i have been in a meaningless situationship for too long?,"I (29f) feel like i have lost all interest for life. I feel emotionally burnout and having no interest in anything. I always feel like my energy is drained and i feel lonely  but i feel like isolating all the time as well.

This has caused trouble to all aspects on my life. I have almost lost my M.Sc. as i don't feel like communicating with professors because all i have this anxiety i will be judged. I hardly communicate with my supervisors at job because i feel i might do something wrong too. I also have lack of motivation sometimes and do the bare minimum. I used to be a star student and excellent at communicating at my job and doing a stellar job  until my ex of 6 years broke up with me  but didn't pause the communication.

Said ex in last months of relationship would (not only he but also his parents who were extremely toxic to me  and didn't like that the relationship was getting serious due to my humble upbringing) judge every aspect of me. I know these judgements weren't his words  and his parents poisoned him  as whenever he distances himself from them he is the sweet caring guy i met 8 years ago. From small things in my behaviour that they didn't agree with  to the simple and practical way i dress  to my weight.

Ex won't leave me alone though. For last two years he insists on being friends  going out and micromanaging every single aspect of my life. I feel like i am in a relationship but only with the bad things (like the control  not having freedom to decide on your own what to do  the ""constructive"" judgement)  and lacking the good stuff (words of affirmation  feeling special to someone  the intimacy)

Ex will also throw in phrases like ""fine  go find someone else  don't care if it hurts me"" and ""after all i have done for you  is that the way you thank me  by wanting to go and find someone else that easily?"". He won't budge any way to try to solve problems from his part and be with me as he claims "" he still loves me  he even wants to marry me  but we have problems""

I feel like all this drains my energy and my confidence. Having worst of both worlds (in relationship and single) makes me feel invalidated as a human. Like i only deserve the bad things in life and that my life is just work  and pleasing others  without any feeling of joy for me. I feel like nothing has meaning anymore. I can't go plan my day as i please  but i don't get any affirmation or intimacy from that situation either.

I also feel like time passes  i am not getting any younger  and staying in this situation will only result in me being forever alone  while he goes his merry way one day... 

I asked for some distance for at least some time to erase the feelings and then try to be friends again  but he doesn't agree on that.

mentalhealth,I'm tired of pretending like everything is okay,"(This is a burner account)

I (25f) feel so overwhelmed all the time. I don't know what to do with my life. I'm currently pursuing my 2nd bachelor's degree just because my first one didn't amount to anything. I don't know what career path to take because they all suck. Living in a capitalist society sucks. 

My whole childhood was spent trying to survive a physically and emotionally abusive narcissistic father while my mom was living paycheck to paycheck while also being abused so she was unable to care for our emotional needs. I come from a family that fakes appearances  so from the outside I look perfectly fine. But on the inside I'm falling apart.

I am unemployed because no one wants to hire a student  so I can't afford a therapist.

I have no friends because it is extremely difficult for me to connect with people who are priviledged. (Meaning who didn't have to grow up in survival mode). Because of my upbringing  I get misunderstood a lot and people assume things about me because I don't look like what I've been through.

I'm honestly debating on whether I should just crash out. I'm tired of pretending. I tired of acting as if I'm like everybody else. Im tired of acting like I come from a stable home. I'm tired of wondering how the people around me have such fullfilling lives until I'm reminded that they came from a stable home. They were financially secure. They've been followed by therapist their whole lives. They're surrounded by people that look like them. They've never had to go through what I went through. 

I have to keep reminding myself that them and I came from different circumstances so it's normal that our life paths don't allign. My question is where do I belong? Where can I look to for guidance? What will become of me? How do I get out of this mindset? I need help.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1j20ybn/im_tired_of_pretending_like_everything_is_okay/

mentalhealth,I Know Nobody Cares  But I Will Post This Anyways,"I have been lonely for years now since I quit high school in 2022. Most people that were in my life even a little bit left quickly after and the ones that stuck around were no good for me so I had to cut them off. I don't miss any of them  but I just wish someone could give a care about me. I have been dealing with mysterious health issues since around that time as well which makes getting out of the house often a pain. Sometimes a nice warm shower is enough to sap me of all energy for the rest of the day. I don't think working would be reasonable because this as well. I did try to do some work for my father which fortunately can be done from a computer  but i just can't focus.

Lately my loneliness and depression have gotten so bad that it is getting physical. Like a kind of psychosis. Brain fog. Temperature regulation issues. My room is dark because it is calmer on my eyes and the only light comes from my computer basically. So the shadows seem like they are alive sometimes  even though I know they are not. I have one online friend I can talk to sometimes  but since he lives in a different time zone  we can only talk briefly. I personally think that platforms like reddit contribute to the problem of loneliness by disallowing DMs. Like how the hell am I supposed to make even one friend when DMs are not allowed? Comment sections are normally about as meaningful as an empty peanut shell. I just want to talk to someone about the abstract stuff in my mind. But whatever I guess. Like I said above. No one cares.

Parents have no idea what to do. Can't blame them. They are not very emotionally available people so there is not much they can do. Its just not how they are or how they were raised. They were probably lucky enough to not have any major struggles in life so they ended up ok  like most people. I don't want to go on meds because i feel like I would lose my mind. I want to be me.

I have mostly resigned from real life as there is really nothing left here for me. I feel like my physical existance is melting away to leave only the pure mind. The world of fictional non fiction in my mind. I think that these years of little human contact are starting to get to me  but unlike before  now I have no outlets. I am not even suicidal. Just stuck in limbo.

I know this place is probably a pretty bad one to try to make a friend  but I honestly don't even care anymore. Subs that advocate for mental health have so many damn rules you'd be more free in prison.

I’ve tried to get better but I feel like I’m getting worse and I’ve honestly given up at this point. Most days I’m unable to do anything without feeling sick  I can’t talk to anyone about it because almost everyone dismisses and invalidates what I say. I stopped reaching out to family/friends for support and my mom who I live with can’t comprehend/remember that I get sick frequently. It has caused so many arguments between us that I honestly just avoid telling her how I’m feeling anymore. At this point I’m completely self isolated  I almost never leave my room and if I do it’s to go to the bathroom or take a shower. I avoid eating because I would have to see my mom but I don’t have much of an appetite anyways. I know I need to see a doctor and also a therapist but my doctor isn’t very helpful and he usually just orders more blood tests that come back “looking normal”.

How do I talk about it to them? I don't want to be a burden to them with my bad mood.

I just want a long hug. But it's weird to ask for one. I don't want to be a ""Where's my hug at"" guy

P.S. Closest friends are female  so it's weird to ask for a hug from them. The same goes for male friends. It's just weird",17,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ftydgx/i_feel_like_nobody_cares_about_me/
mentalhealth,Nobody cares about me,Everyone expects me to cope with my feelings and just get on with it. I have GCSEs next year and all these teachers just expect me to get on with it and not get distracted but I can’t cope  I can’t sleep because I have nightmares all the time and I just can’t stop thinking about what happened every day. Even when I cry after a counselling session at school  the teachers would rather I have that session last period so I can just go home to cry than go to their office and miss a lesson. Is it that hard to just support me? My social worker hasn’t talked to me in two months  I haven’t heard a word from her. I feel as if I’ve just been brushed off to the side and everyone assumes I’m fine. Everyday I think of suicide  everyday it’s getting worse to cope.

mentalhealth,When I reaised nobody cares ,"I realized that nobody cares after my worst  4th grade experience. I remember that I got into a fight with one of my classmates  and the teacher took us out of class. She blamed me because  at that time  she knew very well she hated me. When she was about to put me in detention  I had just had enough and said everything inside me—how my parents treated me the same way  how I am always blamed  how I have no real friends  and how I am always getting blamed even if I don't do anything. 

That's when the teacher looked at me with tears in her eyes and seemed shocked. My classmate was speechless and stood there with regret for all the things he had done to me because he was also my bully. I remember vividly that the teacher and I  but not exactly how it went  ended up with her and my classmate taking a table from the class  two chairs  and my classmate going back to class. 

My teacher and I sat there; she cried for about 5 minutes and then told me she was sorry. However  she still said that I was in the wrong and that she would talk to the principal about my behavior in class. That was when I knew nobody cared  and it didn't matter what or how I said it—nobody cared. I would like to know your thoughts on what to do and if there is anybody with asimular story.",3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1efp2bk/when_i_reaised_nobody_cares/

mentalhealth,Would someone take the time to wish me a happy birthday? I don't have anyone and don't want to feel so alone today.,"Today is my birthday and this sounds pretty sad  but I just want someone to wish me a happy birthday and maybe say something nice. I no longer have any friends or family left and just want some sort of human connection  even if it is just over Reddit  to make me feel just a bit less isolated and forgotten.

I have just endured so much lately and I don't have anyone to talk to or confide in  but I thought I could make it through today just fine. I was wrong. I feel stupid and pitiful while I'm typing this  but I just want to know someone is out there and understands.Getting to this point happened without me even realizing how solitary I had become until I was completely alone. I might as well lay it out  as just the act of typing it might be some sort of catharsis.

So how did I end up here? I started typing out damn near my whole life story  but that made this post so long that if I left it included there was an even smaller chance someone would read this. So highlights then? Abandoned by parents  raised by grandparents  abused by neighbor from ages 5 to 8  horrible abandonment issues  started getting into drugs  dropped out of high school  got a GED  some life happened  was totally Goth  some more life happened  made some music and art  now only Goth on the inside  started college  got married  wife left and grandparents arrested/institutionalized due to Alzheimer's/dementia in the same weekend  abruptly left college to move home to sort everything out  oh hey drugs  slowly watched my only family deteriorate before my eyes until they didn't even recognize me any longer  raging heroin addiction to try not to feel any of this  grandfather died  got in trouble with the law  lost everything I owned  homeless junkie interlude  lost almost 3 years of my life in jail/prison over less than $4 000 worth of bad checks  oops can't get a decent job due to criminal record  congestive heart failure  almost die  start getting my life back together  meet a nice girl  marry nice girl  grandmother dies  oh hey again drugs  finally got off the drugs  surprise wife departure  heart failure keeps getting worse  can barely walk  can't work anymore  no job  no insurance  no access to healthcare.

That about sums it up the backstory. I finally have gotten some healthcare and counseling. Sadly  I can no longer work. I'm trying to go through the disability process  but that takes a great deal of time. It is difficult without proper access to the doctors I need  but I'm getting there. I've also been clean for 4 years and I'm never going back to that dependence. Never before in my life did I ever feel like I was completely done with drugs  but this time it has really stuck. Haven't even had any cravings and now it never even crosses my mind. I'm finally in a good and stable place in my recovery.

Now I have other issues though. Poverty is very real. The threat of eviction looms nearly every month. Being able to afford the 12 different prescriptions I take is really hard and I find myself cutting pills in half because even $70 a month for medicine is a real challenge. I was able to get enrolled back in college and that is the plan of how to survive until I graduate and find work I'm physically able to handle. I'm working towards a career in counseling because I want to be able to use all of these nightmare experiences to help other people. I want to use what time I have left on this planet to help others and hopefully leave it better than I found it.

That is how you end up alone on your 40th birthday  typing on an ancient laptop that you pray survives a couple more months until you transfer schools and can get a replacement with financial aid funds. My family died. Drugs pushed everyone away for years except other drug addicts and an addict isn't anyone's friend. I am no longer able to work  so I don't have those human connections anymore. My wife had been my best friend  so when she surprised me by suddenly leaving the last person I had a connection with went with her. Now that my congestive heart failure has progressed just walking enough to shop for groceries  take out the trash  or getting the mail is a huge challenge  so just going out to walk around and meet people is near impossible. Having zero available disposable income also doesn't help. If I can hold on a couple more months and everything works out I'll be able to switch schools and have more aid options that will take care of my financial and healthcare needs. I'm just trying to hold on and it is so hard.

There is the abbreviated story if you somehow stopped on this post and actually read through everything. If you made it this far  thank you for listening. If you have the time to say happy birthday or say something nice I would really appreciate it. You really don't know how much it would mean to me. No one else is going to tell me today  so you might get to be the only person that wishes me a happy birthday. I don't get any presents or any cake. I don't get a birthday meal or get to do anything cool. I don't get to go anywhere or see anyone. There won't be any birthday cards in the mail or celebratory emails. That's okay though. If one person manages to take the time to read this and let me know there is someone  anyone out there then it'll be alright.

&#x200B;

Edit: Update - Thanks so much to everyone. I barely have any words. Just thank you all so very much. You did bring a grown man to tears  but the best kind. I haven't had anyone say anything this nice to me in years and just reading through these comments is the single best thing I've experienced in a long time.

&#x200B;

Update 2. I am speechless. I've read every comment. Tried to respond to every chat  but I have to get back to bed for now. I just wanted to thank everyone again. All of you helped turn my birthday into an amazing and memorable experience. From the very bottom of my humbled heart  thank you.",564,267,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/dtmqje/would_someone_take_the_time_to_wish_me_a_happy/

mentalhealth,I feel so alone and it is hurting me so bad mentally,"Ok so basically I’m 18 and I’ve never had a relationship  I’ve always been ready or felt it but I’ve never found someone who I automatically got close to until this year. I met her on New Year’s Eve and we went on a college trip in February with some mutual friends and others. We got really close  cuddling in the room with our friends in it falling asleep together holding hands  the whole thing. The flight back she sat next me  we were cuddling  holding hands and watching movies together. I thought this was finally it  i had never felt this good before.

When we got back we spoke everyday as much as we could and called most nights just boosting my thoughts and feelings. I told her how I felt as this was the first time I felt comfortable enough to and she said she needed time which I was obviously fine with. But then she told me a couple of weeks ago she doesn’t like me like that anymore and it really hurt. 

I know it’s silly because we were never official or anything but I felt so comfortable and I thought she did to but now I feel like I was just there to make her feel good. She didn’t actually care how I felt as long as she was happy. And that hurts. I thought this was it. 

Anyway since that day I’ve not been the same  I used to be anxious a lot a couple of years ago and now it’s coming back and it feels so much worse. I am shaking most nights thinking about everything  hating myself for getting so attached. When I am really bad I start to hate her and what she done to me which I really don’t like. 

Sorry if I haven’t really said much about my mental health but if anyone has any tips on how to get over this it will really help me a lot. ",3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jouq24/i_feel_so_alone_and_it_is_hurting_me_so_bad/
mentalhealth,i feel so alone,"
i don’t know how to keep doing this. 

my bf (25m) & i (23f) have been together on & off for 2 years. we both REALLY struggle with mental health problems & are both medicated. 

he’s currently going through a lot because he’s in the process of taking over his family business. he’s under a lot of stress & really struggles with confidence due to his dads verbal abuse 24/7. 

i moved to our city 3 years ago & am away from all family/friends. i am fully financially independent & live in a studio apartment with my cat. 

last may we broke up due to him being unable to show up for me when i was struggling. we were broken up the whole summer then got back together in august. since this ive REALLY struggled to communicate & confide with him. 

when we got back together i lost my grandma & i’ve been struggling since. 

i’m currently mentally at my lowest. today he tried to talk to me about it all  because ive shut off the entire world except work & my home. i’ve been smoking everyday & have just lost all motivation. 

tonight i think i hit rock bottom. 

after this conversation about how my mental health is effecting him  we were supposed to go to a friends sleepover birthday party & when it came time to leave i started crying. 

i told him to go without me & he did. the moment he left i had a panic attack. i didn’t reach out to him  i eventually calmed myself down & laid in bed. 

an hour later he called me  he just was double checking that i didn’t want to come & even though i did  i told him i didn’t & began to cry again. i had another panic attack & ended up throwing & breaking my phone. 

i texted him & told him i broke my phone & apologized for hanging up so abruptly. i told him to not worry about me & go have fun. 

i texted him asking if he could spend the night at 10pm & he didn’t respond until 12. when he did respond  he didn’t acknowledge  what i said & just apologized & said he’s drunk.  i just apologized for him for tonight & said goodnight. 

tonight was the first time ive ever self harmed. 

i feel so stupid & dramatic & embarrassed. i cut up my fking leg  just about broke my hand & slammed my head until i went dizzy. i feel like im insane. 

all i wanted during that was someone to come help me. i texted him  but i guess i can’t communicate it in a clear enough way. 

now i dont even know if i want to see him. i feel so abandoned & alone. i dont know what to do. as much as i want him to be here for me  i just feel so hurt. 

i wish i could just disappear. ",1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jcgx8l/i_feel_so_alone/

mentalhealth,Does anyone feel the same way? I feel so alone with my struggles.,"Hi everyone   
  
I'm 24 years old  living in Germany  and I’ve been struggling with severe depression and generalized anxiety  disorder (diagnosed) for a long time. I have no contact with my family and live alone. Even though I meet up with friends regularly—for example  going on nature walks—I often still feel incredibly lonely. Communication is hard for me  and my mind constantly feels foggy  making it difficult to think  speak  or even write clearly.

Physically  I experience symptoms like heart palpitations  dizziness while walking  tinnitus  muscle pain  tension  and twitching. My sleep is completely irregular  and I often feel extreme exhaustion. Some days  I don’t eat properly and just scroll on my phone for hours  like when i wake up i'm on IG and scrolling for almost 1-2 hours before i actually wake up. I struggle with keeping up with daily tasks  and appointments stress me out so much that I often avoid them.

I started outpatient therapy  but I was told that it likely wouldn’t be effective for me. Since then  I’ve barely seen a doctor because I’m terrified of being diagnosed with something serious. I’ve always had a strong tendency toward hypochondria  and I constantly worry about my health. At the same time  I also experience existential fears—financial struggles  feeling stuck in life  and an overwhelming fear of the future. Some days  I think about death as a relief  even though I don’t actually want to die  i'm actually scared to die.

After my last real relationship ended (2years ago)  my mental health declined a lot. I started smoking heavily (14-15 cigarettes a day  sometimes even more) and drinking regularly on weekends with friends and going to parties. I don't do that anymore regularly  instead we meet for hiking  but I still feel like I’m just stuck in a cycle—spending five days at home doing nothing but being on the PC sometimes playing the piano and gaming with friends  feeling overwhelmed by even the smallest tasks  and being afraid to go outside alone.

I know I need to change something  but I feel like my body is made of lead  and everything is just too overwhelming. I often have disturbing dreams  feel emotionally unstable  and struggle with feelings of anger  frustration  and worthlessness. I worry a lot about what others think of me and fear that people notice how bad I actually feel.

I guess I just need to hear from someone who understands. Are there others here who feel the same way? Or has anyone been in a similar situation and found a way to cope? I don’t need criticism—I already know I’m struggling. I just want to feel less alone in this.

mentalhealth,I feel so numb at times and other I feel so alone.,Idk honestly. These past few months have been horrible. Just when I got my anxiety under control I experienced a few traumatic events  some that affected my health and my relationship with a few friends. I am not exactly suicidal but at points I feel so numb that I just don't care. I don't feel the urge to do something but I think about my death a lot. I feel like all my friends have drifted from me and feel so lonely. I feel like I have friends but not close ones. I feel so strange  I don't feel normal. I can't sleep  I'm studying medicine and this semester I've witnessed death multiple times. These past few months have just showed me some of the worst in humanity. I can't concentrate in class  I have no energy  I hate looking at myself in the mirror. I didn't have time or energy to do the things I enjoy.  The last 3 months I've been surrounded by death  sadness  and violence. My brain is constantly reminding me of these events and my anxiety is so bad. I'm having panic attacks again. Everyone tells me I seem like I'm coping well but that's bc I know if I told them how I envision myself dying  they'd probably try to commit my ass  and that's not what I need. I just need everything to return back to the way it was.

mentalhealth,I Feel So Lost and Alone,hey yall so I'm gonna try to keep things pretty concise i don't wanna waste yalls time. I'm 17M and live with my parents and siblings. i had a really rough childhood and i have a terrible relationship with my father. he was really physically  and mentally and emotionally abusive to me growing up. way less physical since I've gotten older but definitely still just as if not worse with the mental. i don't even ever call him my dad because in my opinion he hasn't earned that title  he's just my father. anyways i could sit here and talk about the things he's done and how its affected me forever but I'm not here to talk about that  just wanted to give a little context to my home life. he's taken everything from me  my door  every electronic device  even started changing the wifi password everyday so i cant use any device he doesn't know about. he even took the landline house phone so i cant talk to anyone. when I'm at home I'm cut off from the outside world  and i feel like its affecting me more than it normally would because I'm going through a particularly hard time and i dont really have anyone. ive been going through a really messy breakup  and i kept thinking it would get better with time but if anything its just getting worse. she was my anchor  the person who i went to with all my problems  the person who helped me. i was pretty suicidal and i met her and my life got so much better. she really helped me  just by being there for me  a luxury i havent had often in my life. for context we were together for 11 months and knew eachother for over a year. it was also what i consider my first real relationship. and its like im dealing with the stress of my home life  and the breakup  but she was the one who would help me with my home life so its like a double whammy you know. anyways the thoughts are back and im not sure what to do. i turn 18 in 6 months and then i can leave and everyone always says just to wait a litte longer and ill be out soon and everything but like i feel like ive been at my breaking point for years now. im not sure how long i can keep going. i feel like at this point im only living because other people want me to. im just tired  so tired. i cant eat  i cant sleep  and of course all thats making my mind and body feel worse. it got really bad one night recently and i went to call the suicide hotline and i saw my dad had taken the house phone again. it was 4 in the morning and that was the most utterly alone ive felt in my entire life. i think because of the way i grew up ive always kind of cared about others more than myself. when she was my girlfriend she was the most important thing in my life. i wouldve died for her  and still would. i wouldve given anything and everything to make her happy. i feel like she gave me a purpose  something finally worth living for. my entire life prior to her i had just been surviving  but now i was finally living. now that she's gone i feel like i dont have a tether to the world anymore. i dont want to be here. its like that was my last straw. i dont want to die  i just dont want to be so tired anymore. i have a little bit more to say so if anyone wants like a part 2 to finish out my thoughts id be happy to share. if anyone has any questions or anything feel free to ask  im an open book. and thank you to anyone who actually read this.,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jcfayo/i_feel_so_lost_and_alone/
mentalhealth,I just can't fix my brain and no one can help me  I feel so alone. Wish I had my cognitive abilities back,My brain is not working and I've felt like this for at least 7 years  all starting from elementary school. I can't get a degree  I don't see myself ever getting into relationship  don't think I'm gonna learn many things that are common sense to people my age  I just don't see myself having a comfortable life ever. I'm in my early twenties and I'd love to do things young people do  and have the experiences they do and at the same time build my life but I don't even feel comfortable around my parents  how can I deal with other people? I just feel so foggy and it makes everything awkward. Only way I can articulate myself is by writing my thoughts out. My mind feels blank  I have hard time finding the words I wanna use in the moment and form a coherent sentence  my short term memory is bad  I'm forgetful and every day tasks feel like rocket science. Even when I'm turning my head my brain has a delay processing what it's looking at and hard time fixating my eyes somewhere. It's like my eyes would rather be zoned out constantly. Makes me kind of lightheaded and gives me this uncomfortable sensation in my head. I feel this 24/7 and never got used to it. That's why I can't even take eye contact. It feels like my eyes don't work. I just can't explain how bad this is. I wanna move on in life but there's probably no hope. I'm just wired differently. Unlucky with genetics I think. I have been getting episodes of dissociation all my life but the only trigger was bright lights. However in elementary school it went from episodes to chronic so there's no trigger anymore. Also I've been zoning out all my life but now it's 100x more frequent. Don't know what this is. Chronic dissociation  adhd  autism  anxiety  depression or combination of some of those things. Or if there's a medical condition. I mean this is definitely chronic derealization (dissociative state where the world feels dreamlike or distant) but why am I feeling this way? Why it never gets better? Perhaps I am depressed or anxious 24/7? However I don't have any anxious or depressed thoughts. I mean lately I have had them a lot but in these past 7 years I've kind of calmed down and just thought that it'll pass eventually but it never did and now I've realized how bad my situation actually is and I need to take action. I've tried everything. No diet  good sleep or exercising fixes me and in fact I had all of those in order when this fog started. Medications (ssris and snris) and supplements don't help much either. There's no fix. Don't know where this stems from  no one will ever know. You have probably seen me post many times. I just hope someday a miracle happens and someone realizes what this is. Probably not. Many stories sound similar to mine and there's always the same advice.,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ja7sve/i_just_cant_fix_my_brain_and_no_one_can_help_me_i/

Urges may persist  however  i have learnt coping strategies and ways around them now. I didnt think I could at times  but I have!

I dont mean for this to come of bragging or boastful. I just never thought id be able to go for this long  and I thought maybe someone is thinking the same

mentalhealth,I want to disappear,"3 weeks ago I was absolutely blindsided by my partner of 8 years whom I own a house with. Literally the BIGGEST blindside. Leading up to this there was no fighting or arguments. In fact he was telling me he wanted to propose by next summer  he initiated conversations about kids  he was extremely affectionate both verbally and physically. I thought everything was perfect. There was a seemingly mutual respect and we both wanted to do acts of love for each other to show appreciation. 2 days before the blindside I asked if he was depressed  he said yes. We talked about mental health and as he’s never struggled with it before  I encouraged him to seek professional help and lean on me as his partner  not keep it from me like some dirty secret. At the end of the conversation I asked if our relationship was impacted  he said no. I asked if he was one foot out  he said no. I asked if he still wanted to marry me  he said yes. I asked him not to blindside me  he said he wouldn’t. The rest of that night and the following day he was still affectionate. The morning of  he held me closer and tighter to cuddle longer before I had to get up for work. This was the norm every morning.
I came home that night and he was waiting for me at the door teary eyed. And it hit me. He was extremely emotional  throwing up. I asked him when he fell out of love with me  he said he didn’t have an answer. I asked him how long he’s been lying to me  he said it wasn’t a lie. Asked him to look me in the eyes and tell me he doesn’t love me anymore  he looked up and said he couldn’t. Asked if he didn’t want a future with me anymore  he said that’s a difficult question to answer. Any question I had was met with “I don’t have an answer”. He said he’s lost himself in the last month  he feels like a void. He said the version of him I love doesn’t “exist” anymore  he’s “changed”. He said he’s not my one  that I’ll end up with an amazing guy and he’ll end up alone. He said he can’t be in a relationship  he doesn’t have the emotional capacity to connect with anymore  he’s never going to date again. He said he wants me to hate him and move on because I deserve better. He said he disconnected from me and everyone and everything. Yet now  after spending months pulling away from his friends  he’s back to making sure he has plans. I have felt so low the last 3 weeks. Confused  traumatized that my seemingly perfect relationship was a sham. I’ve been struggling with eating and sleeping and have even turned to drinking because it’s the only time I don’t cry.

mentalhealth,Does anyone else just want to disappear?,"I find myself at times wanting to just not exist anymore. Not necessarily kill myself but just not be here anymore. 

I don’t have a bad life; I have a family that loves me  a pretty solid job (albeit shitty bosses)  good savings  no debt  my needs are met  and even have a nice car. 

My family are all successful in the same impressive career path  from the same university  and I chose a different path. I’m not exactly ashamed for being different  but I don’t feel like I fit in with them despite actually fitting in in most ways except career wise. 

I had awful mental health issues years ago which forced me to end a good relationship because they loved me too much to break up with me despite me being an absolutely awful person. Maybe I’m over exaggerating to myself how bad I was but I know I did and said some bad things but I won’t justify it as being young and dumb. My mental health issues started when I was 20 and I felt like I went into a psychosis  for a bit and lashed out at those around me. 

I try to work hard  and I think I am ambitious despite feeling I’m not. Every day seems to just be another repetition of the last  and like nothings changing despite my efforts.

Some days I’m fired up about life but I find myself always having this thought in the back of my head about not wanting to participate in it. I don’t know if I actually know how to actually feel happy anymore.

mentalhealth,I Survived a Genocide But I Feel Nothing,"I managed to evacuate from Gaza  leaving behind the rubble  the bodies  and the memories of the war zone. You’d think getting out would bring relief  a sense of safety—but all it brought me was emptiness. I thought once I escaped  I’d be able to feel again  to grieve for the lives lost  for the people I knew. But I feel nothing.

I’m in a place far from the violence now  surrounded by people who are living normal lives. They go about their day  complaining about trivial things—traffic  their jobs  relationship problems. And I just stare at them. How do they not realize how absurd it all is? I survived hell  saw children torn apart in the streets  watched families disappear overnight  and now I’m expected to care about small talk? I don’t.

Even after I got out  people wanted me to share my story  to talk about the horrors I escaped. But every time I do  I feel detached  like I’m telling someone else’s story. I describe the destruction  the bodies  the screams  but it feels like I’m reading from a script. I can’tonnect to it anymore. It’s like I left my emotions back there  buried under the rubble.

I’ve lost all sense of empathy. When I hear about someone dying  even someone close  it doesn’t register. I didn’t cry when I found out a friend of mine didn’t make it out. I didn’t care when I heard about others losing everything. I go through the motions  pretending to sympathize  but inside  it’s just blank.

People think escaping the genocide means survival  but it’s not true. Part of me died there  and the part that made me human never made it out. Now  when I see images of what’s still happening  or hear about others’ struggles  I can’t bring myself to feel anything. I walk past people begging for help  and I feel no urge to stop.

I’m broken in ways no one can see. On the outside  I’m functioning. I smile  I work  I talk to people. But inside  I’m just as destroyed as the streets I left behind.

mentalhealth,My mom is taking everything out on me and I think I'm hurt,"My mom and my dad tend to have these huge fights which last several days  they're very frequent and I hate them with a passion. Also when it happens  I'm scared for both of them and myself because my mom in particular loves verbally and physically using me as a punching bag.

She wants to go see her parents in another country and keeps (unrealistically) expressing how useless I am  how I can't even manage the house and look after my family at 16. I can do those things. Not perfectly  but I can do a pretty good job. 

Today she made me wake up super early  rushed me in making my own breakfast and my dad's and speed eating it. I almost choked. Then she made me cook and clean for 4 hours straight. Normally it wouldn't be a problem because I like doing those things in a peaceful environment but she was following me everywhere and hovering and hitting and shouting at me every time I was just a tad too slow  she never explained or corrected  just hit. Everything still hurts.

The worst of it was when I was cleaning the pantry and knelt down near a shelf  she beat me so hard my head went and banged against the shelf and now I feel a portion of my scalp kind of raised and I feel something wet moving around under it. I cried and told her that and she thought I was overreacting and continued shouting insults. It still hurts. I think I need to go to the hospital.

I went to my dad crying after that and he yelled at my mom some more amidst the fight  and told her to back off of hurting me. She said she was actually being really nice (she wasn't). It went on like that for most of the morning  she called her mom at some point to yell about how stupid and crazy my dad  my sister and I are and how she can't tolerate us anymore. 

I still haven't stopped crying. It was a terrible morning and I just don't know what to do. I hope she goes to her parents soon so I can get a break.

The best part of the morning though  was my dad coming back home halfway after he'd left for the office. I went out to go ask him if he'd forgotten something and he was like  ""Yeah  I forgot to tell you to stay strong. Don't cry  you know how crazy she gets. She shouldn't expect you to become a professional at everything in one day. If she gets too bad  shout back.""

I was grateful for that. My mom is thankfully out of the house now but I'm still sitting here writing this in fear. I want her to leave so bad.

mentalhealth,It’s a crime to be a girl ,It’s a crime to be a girl in my country India. I have never ever tried defaming my country but with everything going on around and that constant fear what if something bad happens it is really scaring me a lot. I have been considered as a burden in my own family and this safety thing has always been there. I do have some really horrifying experiences too and with each passing day I feel this “It’s a crime to be a girl! It’s a crime to hope for a justice in my country!” I am even writing all this with shivering hands  sorry if I hurted anyone’s sentiments but as an Indian girl it’s utmost painful to even say this! ,382,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1f6kssr/its_a_crime_to_be_a_girl/
mentalhealth,As a rape survivor  I want to let you know that things will get better! Maybe not now  maybe not immediately but they eventually will! Don’t give up!,"Although I myself still struggle after being raped nearly 2 and a half years ago (and the rape will impact me my whole life) I want to let you know that time really heals wounds.

After  I got raped it was the worst time in my life. There are no words to describe how horrible it was. From a person who was very confident  lived in multiple countries  travelled the world I was afraid to go to my local grocery shop. I nearly had a panic attack when I was alone with a man in a shopping aisle. I had to postpone all my exams  my academic and social life suffered immensely. I had PTSD  anxiety  depression etc. I had very dark thoughts. I considered taking a year out of university because just getting out of bed was a struggle for me. I could write a book about all the negative effects of rape.

But now I honestly feel so much better. Of course  I still suffer the effects. But compared to the past I have made great progress. I am planning to continue my therapy though as I feel like my healing process is not over.

But I want to let you know that things will get better. I have graduated from top 30 university in the world with a prestigious degree  last year I was a committee member of multiple societies at my university. I am looking forward to life.

One thing I would tell you is that don’t put a timeline or deadline for your recovery. And don't compare yourself to others. I used to wonder will I ever get better. Why I am not getting better already? Why is it taking so long? Don’t compare your recovery to someone else. Although I will recover the whole of my life  what I mean is that If you are not getting better/progressing in a certain period of time is okay.

Everyone is different and take as much time you need to heal.

For me  it was also hard to see all my friends enjoying life and this tragedy happening to me. But now I am slowly accepting that life didn’t turn out exactly the way I wanted. And bad things happened to good people.

I am posting this because I felt much better myself reading stories of rape victims that persevered and ‘overcame’ their trauma.

I am wishing you nothing but the best. And please don’t give up. Life is beautiful  even if it does not see this way now.",629,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/junrt7/as_a_rape_survivor_i_want_to_let_you_know_that/
mentalhealth,I feel like giving up,"I don’t know how else to say it. I feel like giving up. I’ve been battling mental health problems for a song as I can remember (i’m 25). I suffer from depression and anxiety. I’ve been working hard for years to improve my mental health. I’m seeking help. I’m on meds  but nothing REALLY helps. I’ve been working minimum wage jobs forever. I went to university for film which I no longer want to pursuit. So now I have debt and a worthless piece of paper. Every other opportunity I go for that could get my out of this rut never works out. My father has alzheimer’s but he lives 5000 miles away. My grandmother just passed away. It feels like it’s always one bad thing after another. I live with my mom with no hope to get out. I’ve never felt like I fit in this world. I feel so alien and such an outsider. I can’t connect with people on a deep level either. Everyone is just an acquaintance to me. I’m social  and outgoing. I can converse with people no problem. But it’s always very surface level. I don’t feel like i belong here. I’m not made for this world or this life… I’m just so lost and hopeful about my life and future.

I am aware that my country (Japan) isn't really supportive for mental health in principle but I DO need some help to deal with life.

Other people are always getting what they want  And sometimes I have thoughts of killing people in horrible ways because of my anger and hatred just boiling up inside(for example  someone can call me skinny  and ill act out ripping their jaw open with brute fore in the shower that night☹️👎). I cant rely on religion  because SOMETHING has to be doing this to me  right? So God hates me  nothing good is happening and I'm just all around losing. Its been like this for 3 years now. Simple tasks and daily routines are starting to feel harder and I'm losing the energy to try.

mentalhealth,I feel like giving up and I don't know what to do,"I (22f) live with my partner (23m) in a pretty  very spacious 2-bed apartment in the most gorgeous village I have ever seen. We are madly in love and have been for the last two years. I am a writer trying to finish off probably the best piece of fiction I have ever written  and he is an aspiring music producer who churns out tune after tune  and is always coming up with new ideas.

Sounds healthy  right? It sounds so idyllic reading it over.

Well  it's not. At least that's how I feel about it.

Things have gone downhill for us ever since we moved in together. My partner and I have struggled financially ever since we moved in together last year. It took him two weeks and one job application to land himself a job at a world-renowned pizza chain where he was promised 12 hours a week  only to realise not long after that it was  in fact  a 0-hour contract. I  however  spent 8 months trying to land a job: ideally full-time so I could support us while he was at college.

The job is killing me. I can't handle it. I haven't been going in and instead I have sent them fit note after fit note  too scared to even set foot in the place. I am Autistic  and it is a barista job. It is not a good combination for me  yet it is the only company that hired me. 

I am relentlessly picked on by a member of management there. They know I am on the spectrum and  despite the fact I can hold a full adult conversation with someone  they treat me like a child  belittling me at every chance they get in front of staff and customers. They speak to me like I barely have any understanding of what is going on around me. Whenever I have gone in that place  I ultimately leave in tears.

Yes  I could look for another job. Considering I am about to lose the one I have now  It's definitely in my best interests to do that. And I have; I've been searching since January. No one will hire me  despite the fact that I have 6 years of retail experience in many different retail environments. I don't know why they won't hire me. Maybe it's the Autism (because fuck the equal opportunities act  am I right). Maybe it's the fact that ""the most gorgeous village"" that I live in is in the middle of nowhere  and they assume that the ONE bus that goes through my village  the only mode of transport I have to rely on  won't get me there on time. Either way  there is always someone that is  ""more experienced than you.""

Not only that  but I am miles away from my family. My partner is fine. His parents drive and can get to us within the hour. Mine? They are 140 miles away! My dad has a motorbike  but he hates the country roads and it's a lot of effort for him. My brother and his partner have a car  but they can't be bothered either. I have to go to THEM  which I obviously enjoy doing. If it weren't for the fact it costs £125 for a 28-day bus ticket  plus an additional £2-£5 for the bus service in their county  I would go more often. And the more I visit them  the more I hate leaving.

I hate it here. I hate my life. If I could just rewind time and stay with my parents and just never accept the offer on the apartment  I would. I wish I could drop it all now  pack up and leave. I feel like I have ruined my partner's life because I said moving here would be a good idea. He swears I haven't done such a thing and that he loves the life he has with me  but I can't help but wonder if he only says that to make me feel better. 

I feel stuck. I don't know how to fix it all.",3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jkpnz7/i_feel_like_giving_up_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do/

mentalhealth,I don’t want to give up but I can’t see a way,I don’t know where this should really go but it relates to my mental health so this is my best guess atm. I can’t work due to my mental health and I have spent the last 7+ years trying to claw my way out of this and create a life for myself where I can actually function like a normal person. But everything I do where I have to ask for outside help from services or people or anything I can’t do purely under my own steam fails. I’ve tried everything I could that was available to me. I’ve made progress but it’s always been when I’ve been on my own with no support from services and it’s limited because there’s only so much I can do on my own. The last year and a half I got into fitness which has helped a tonne and I discovered I actually love weight training. So the next idea I had in order to get myself into work is to do training to become a PT and aim at helping people in similar situations to me with weight and depression/anxiety. But I found out I can’t do the training for it. I’ve looked into multiple ways and I can’t get funding for any way and I can’t pay for it myself. This was my last hope. All I want is a life where I’m functional and independent and it’s never going to happen when every single thing I try is ripped away from me like this. I didn’t ask to be born like this and yet I feel like I am being cruelly punished for it. ,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jekif3/i_dont_want_to_give_up_but_i_cant_see_a_way/

mentalhealth,Should i give up on relationships?,"17M  
Always have been alone with no real love interest  i had crushes on girls  but nothing ever happened with the crushes  even when i confessed  nothing would happen  except rejection. I'm so sick and tired of seeing couples on social media  or even any romantic/sexual posts on media  it's like mockery to me  my own phone is saying: ""Instead of scrolling  go outside loser."". And very tired of listening to male classmates talk about having gfs  even the worst a'hole of the class talks about girls  but not me  not at all.

A bit of blame can be put on me though  as i'm very isolated and live a very robotic life. Home -> High School -> Home   with sometimes  going out in the city with \*\*my parents\*\* cause i am way too ashamed of myself to go alone. I'm very shy and quiet  and was often bullied for even speaking  my voice is pretty deep but weird sounding  and because of bullying  not only for my voice  i just try to be as reserved as possible. So  my chances of getting a gf while being a complete fallout shelter typa guy  is close to if not 0.

But the thing is  my depression sometimes makes me think i am as ugly as a man can be  and insecurities about myself run across my mind like wild fire  but when my mood is a bit up  i don't think i look as bad  and honestly  i might not be ugly that much  i do reckon getting looked at by random girls  even a couple days ago  i was walking with a hood over my head  pretty much amplifying my face  and a girl walking by me was staring for seconds before passing by  that gave a little boost to my hope of getting a gf  but not enough to try really.

So in short  i'm not that bad looking  probably 6/10  potentially 7.5/10 if i had the will to work on myself  but i'm very shy  quiet  very isolated  paranoid perhaps  or all detail in short  i'm a loser pretty much all the time. \*Is there any hope i will be able to have a gf one day?\*",2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1i87r4k/should_i_give_up_on_relationships/
mentalhealth,I am a broken man both mentally and physically. So I jumped on a bike and started pedalling across the country. I'm not stopping until I hit the other side.,"Hi everyone  

About a month ago I started to think about Cycling across country  two weeks later I left Moncton NB at 1pm in the afternoon and haven't looked back  tomorrow I will cross into Quebec. 

I think this is interesting for a few reasons. 

1- As I said  I am fat and out of shape. I am 44m 6'5 320lbs and have not exercised in any meaningful way in 20 years. I have bad knees  bad back  apnea and I'm type 2 diabetic. 

2- Mentally  I'm broken. I suffer from really bad depression  bipolar 2 and Chemicaly Induced Anxiety Disorder. 

3- I was raised as a ward of the court  30+ foster homes  street kid  jail  addiction. Been a hard road. 



So why on earth am I doing this? Two main reasons. First and foremost BC is my home province  they recently passed into law funding for school for former wards of the court regardless of age. I plan on taking full advantage of this and I think this should be the standard across all provinces. I have stagnated in the same industry for years and have hit a ceiling. If I ever want to retire and leave something behind for my girls I need something more. And education is where I'll start. 


Secondly  if I am to be successful with my schooling I need to get my head in order. Because of my CIAD I can't take antidepressants  so all my mental health issues I tackle on my own. And frankly depression is winning. I could fly out to BC and be there 12hrs from now  but I will end up being the same man. 

However  the man that can jump on a bike and pedal his ass all the way to Vancouver Island  that man can do anything. He can regain control of his mental health  he can regain his physical health and he can dedicate a healthy body and mind to his schooling. 

So I want to try and bring some awareness to the mental health struggles and the ward of the court funding thing. 


It's been over two weeks since I've left and there's been some hard dark moments  but there's been some empowering ones too. I'm already down about 20lbs  there's strength in my legs and back ive not felt since I was a teenager  I'm about to cross into a new province and I thought it was worth sharing with this community. 

I have already been posting in another subreddit since I started and they've all been so amazing. 

I have been posting almost daily updates to my insta and tiktok but if I understand correctly I can't link them here on this subreddit? I also have a blog I've been writing when I have time. 

Both the blog and videos are not a magical Xmas land type of upbeat energetic thing. I talk about and show both the ups and downs of mental health and this monumental challenge I've taken on. 


I hope there's a few of you who might pass me on your drives  don't hesitate giving me a honk or a wave. I'll be the big fat guy on a mountain bike :)

mentalhealth,I'm reasonably certain I have some pretty severe mental health problems and my brain just feels broken  pls help pt1,"

I'm 22 now and I'm starting to notice some really bad thought patterns and emotions that are getting worse as times go on. I've become indifferent towards human suffering and death  I've had some close family members die recently and I felt nothing  I just tell myself well they're gone now so nothing productive would come from grieving. I don't care much if I die either  in fact subconsciously  I think it's why I drive recklessly because sometimes I almost hope for a fatal accident. I keep finding myself on edge waiting for something bad to happen  because some event causes a massive life upset about every 2-3 months at this point and I don't relax much anymore because of it. I fell disconnected from society as a whole because I look around and all I see is greed  selfishness  and stupidity. Among all the bad thought patterns rolling around in my head I've also noticed a severe memory problem  I can't really remember anything before 2018 and even the events after are very spotty at times. Even recalling events of the previous day are hard for me at times. A huge thing that has been stressing me out too is a very noticeable cognitive decline  I feel as if my brain is not nearly as sharp as it was just 5 years ago. I used to be very interested in computers  hobbyist electronics and coding and would constantly be tinkering with something and now most of that information is just gone. I can't code to save my life anymore no matter how hard I try to teach myself.

The best way I can describe how I feel is it's like a computer virus took over and courrupted like 80% of my brain. I go about the majority of my day on autopilot  nothing seems to interest me much anymore  the things that do don't hold my attention long. My body and mind hurt  i'm tired  and I feel helpless. Just kinda counting down the days till I can leave this shithole.

I want to enjoy life  I don't want to be angry all the time  I don't want to be completely fed up with the general public 5 seconds after stepping out of my house. I just want to be normal.

Anyone have any thoughts?

mentalhealth,Help a rich middle aged white dude with everything who shouldn’t need help.,"Ok  so as per the title. I'm a f*ing cheesecake. Self made millionaire. No debt  nice family etc. I have absolutely zero reason to be a bitch.

I made my money in SaaS by building everything myself bootstrapped and supporting users myself at first. It was a YEARS of constant work... I'm used to hard work!

For the last year(?) I just... can't?

I want desperately to work  I want to go and get things done but when the time comes I sit down in front of the computer and will find ANYTHING else to do  just doomscrolling the day away  looking at reddit NSFW whatever it is. Constant self-sabotage.

I left my fam for a week to work abroad in a couple of countries to see if changing environment would help and... nothing. No motivation to even go outside and see the new county I'm in.

Im the breadwinner and supporter of my family in every way so I need to be ok. But I've been darker and darker. Hiding behind my phone in front of my family at times and even being sarcastic to my wonderful kids at times which isn't cool.

I get to my office and I should like being there. Weight bench  hammock  free reign to do tf I want.

But when I get there some days I find myself repeating ""I don't want this"" and ""I don't like this"" in my head and fidgeting.

I'm pretty out of touch with my emotions so I've no idea how I'm feeling hey.

mentalhealth,I need help quitting weed for my mental health ,"Hi  

I’m a 23 year old female and I’ve been smoking weed since 17. It didn’t become a problem until the age of 18 where if I couldn’t get any  I would go absolutely mad until I did. 

I struggle with extreme depression and have recently tried to unalive myself. After this incident I have finally realised what a shit show my life is and want to turn it around. 

I am on route to fixing my mental health and addiction but am struggling to start my journey. I have so many people in my circle that smoke and it’s hard for me to say no when offered.

I don’t have the money to spend but I always find myself spending money on weed rather than essential things like food and bills. When being in debt already it’s the worst feeling in the world. 

My parents and partner cannot stand the fact I smoke and to be honest I can’t stand it either. It’s not who I am. 

I’ve been trying to cut down but it’s just not working and I’ve tried cold turkey in the past but always go back. I’ve come to a conclusion that it impacts my mental health negatively and does me no favours. 

I have also gained a lot of weight from binge eating after smoking and I feel disgusting. 

I would love some help as I’m ready to get my life back after so many years of devoting it to something that doesn’t even help me like I thought it did for so long.

mentalhealth,How do I navigate my loss of faith when my mother is devastated and crying every day and night because of it?,"Hello 

I (20F) was born into a practicing Muslim family  but less than a year ago  I realized I no longer believe. I still live with my parents  who expect me to stay until I marry  so hiding my beliefs has become impossible.

My father and I no longer speak  and my mother is devastated. She’s horrified by my views  especially when I say I wouldn’t impose religious rules on my future children or that I have LGBTQ+ friends. She’s ignored me for days after these conversations  and every debate ends in tears.

With Ramadan starting  things got worse. I still fast  but I don’t pray. When my mother noticed  she confronted me  and I said  “According to your beliefs  I’m going to hell  and it’ll be deserved for rejecting Allah’s rules.” I wasn’t trying to be cruel  but make her think “Oh that’s not untrue  she can’t imagine me going to hell but I’m already imagining her going…”

Since then  she’s been crying constantly  loudly  like she’s mourning me. I hear her praying  repeating “Oh Allah” over and over between sobs  and it’s breaking me. I’ve kind of always struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts  and this is making everything worse. I feel like the worst person alive  like I’m selfish for standing my ground.

My younger sister also knows  and now both she and my mother act awkward around me. It’s like they only see a “misbeliever” now. I feel completely excluded. The house feels colder  more distant  suffocating.

I know I need to leave. I’ve been job hunting for a year with no luck. My last year of college starts in September  and I want to finish as fast as possible to gain independence. But right now  I feel trapped in an environment that’s damaging my identity and growth.

I love my mother deeply  she had me right before her 18th birthday  married to a man 15 years older. She doesn’t see her life as tragic or even abnormal (quite the opposite)  but I do  and that makes this even harder. I don’t want to hurt her  but I also can’t betray myself.

How do I cope with this? Should I pretend  at least a little  to make things easier? Am I being selfish for refusing? How do I survive this without completely falling apart? Please help…",6,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1j24l1y/how_do_i_navigate_my_loss_of_faith_when_my_mother/

mentalhealth,I stayed up all night crying on the couch after awful 988 call,"tw: self harm



I'm sixteen. I had one of the shittiest days. It started at dinner when my dad yelled at me for not conversating at the dinner table  when I was tired and barely had an appetite. Feels silly to add but my younger brother disorganized my room after I cleaned it in the morning so I was also a bit pissed. My dad told me to stop giving him attitude  and I snapped and told him to stop fucking yelling and he slapped me. He never hits anyone nor raises his voice when he's fighting with my mom  so I was shocked. I heard my mom telling him he went too far as I ran upstairs.

I was full-on crying at this point and my first instinct was to cut myself. I used a razorblade and kept cutting my arm til there was nowhere else to cut. After cleaning it up I just put on a jacket. My mom came in my room afterwards. Now  my mom is extremely conservative and religious  and believes therapy goes against her values. She doesn't believe depression  anxiety  or other conditions exist  they're just demons fucking with our heads.

But I had the urge to show her my cuts. This wasn't the first time; the last time I showed her she yelled at me and basically demanded how she failed as a parent. Of course today she says the same things  but this time it goes differently.

When she yelled at me  I began hitting my head with my fist. Really hard and I couldn't control it  it just happened. I couldn't see in front of me and I thought I was gonna black out until she pulled my hand away and slapped me. First thing she did was take away my phone.

Anywho at the end after we've both calmed down she finally agrees to look at a psychologist. I think this is only because I told her at my old church  I used to see my pastor for help and he suggested seeing a mental health professional as well. (I'm agnostic  just one of those kids forced to go to church)

**

Alright to the 988 call  I was looking at other hotlines in my state but they were all unavailable. I tried for over 15 minutes. It made me feel so much more alone that crisis lines that claim ""we're always here for you 24/7"" isn't there for me when I most needed it. 

But someone picked up on 988  and this woman named Rachel introduces herself. I begin to tell her about today  but I couldn't even finish halfway before she interrupts me and for the rest of the hour  I never even finished my story. She asks me why I self harm ""after a little fight with your dad that you're going to have every day  I mean you're a teenager! I can't understand why such young people harm themselves over things like that."" Yes  those were her words.

Then she proceeds to ""inform"" me self harm isn't an addiction  it's a choice. So I told her  ""Wouldn't that make smoking and drinking a choice since you're choosing when to smoke or drink? Why do we call that an addiction?"" She didn't respond to that  by the way.

Then she said  ""And you feel guilty afterwards  right? How long does that happiness last after harming yourself  like 1 minute?"" She didn't sound empathetic to my situation at all  and I honestly felt more ashamed than ever.

What made me cry was when she told me that if I wasn't so sad and I tried to improve myself  I could be a hero to my brother and be a role-model to him. It made me cry realizing my brother would never look up to someone like me. I'm not just a fucking worthless piece of shit  I'm the worst sister.

At the end  she made me promise that I'd call back if I needed help again. I said ""yeah"" and she said  ""Oh c'mon  you gotta promise"" in the most playful and obnoxious way. Does she see this as a joke?

I cried for fuckin hours. I didn't even realize it was 5:30 until my mom came downstairs.

Anyway  I never really had a bad experience with 988 before today. There was this one time I had a really helpful dude and he probably is the reason I decided to come back home after trying to run away. But after today  honestly  I don't know if I'll come back.

mentalhealth,I think about ending it every night,I have thoughts about taking my life every night I've been in therapy for the past 3 years I've been depressed for the better part of 10 years and I've almost taken my own life several times  almost every night I sit there crying thinking about how I'd write my note trying to imagine the faces and reactions of my family to talk myself out of it. I keep my gun in my car everyday so its not so readily accessible to myself everytime I get like this. I just feel like such a burden. My family knows I'm depressed and anxious but they have no idea how long I've been like this or how bad it truly is they care for me I know they do. I selfishly tried (and succeeded with several) to push everyone and everything away to make everyone hate me so I could leave without hurting anyone. Years ago when I was in high school still (I dropped out what a loser) I actually resented some of my family because they didn't see how depressed I was but now that I'm 24 I just see that I did a really good job of hiding it and I hate myself for ever resenting them for that. Its killing me inside I put up this front I tell everyone I'm fine when in reality I'm barely holding myself together I'll be at work sometimes when I start thinking about some of this stuff and it takes everything in me not to just break down and I hate how weak that makes me feel. I know I'm messed up in the head but I don't know what to do anymore my therapist helped me to see why I've been so depressed all these years  I let things in my life get to me more than I ever should have let them but I guess growing up I was always told to just don't worry about it  don't cry don't get upset just deal with it and move on but never show excessive emotion and just get over it  so I did just that I tried anyway I told myself I'll get over it in time but I never did when I sit there for too long and think about I feel myself brought right back to that moment in middle school . I just I'm so tired I'm tired of feeling this way I know it would be a guaranteed solution I just I always imagine my moms reactions to it right before I do it my hands and whole body start trembling tears are pouring out my eyes and I'll start screaming but I never do it and I hate myself for not even being able to not screw up that one simple thing,3,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/189mznu/i_think_about_ending_it_every_night/
mentalhealth,Why do i always act happy around people when I cry myself to sleep every night?,I recently moved countries and I can’t speak the language almost at all  its been 6 months and i still haven’t got used to life here. My social life is ass  i only have 1 friend. And the problem is that he’s the nicest person alive and for example he got voted as the nicest person in class  everyone was screaming his name  and I felt like shit because nobody is friends with me so I thought that everyone said him because he’s the only nice person that is friends with a retard like me. Also nobody wants to be around me but regardless I’m always smiling and acting happy even though I’m going threw the hardest time of my life mentally and physically. I also broke up with my girlfriend even though I really love her. Everybody is expecting so much from me but I can’t keep up with anything. School is destroying me  some of the teachers interrogate me and expect me to do super good. I can’t even keep up with the notes what teachers say. I can’t write chemistry notes because everything is so overwhelming and then the teacher acts suprised that I don’t know shit. Every moment in school I’m scared someone is going to talk to me and I what can I tell them. I’ve lost interest in everything. It just seems like everyone is better than me at everything. Nobody likes me. Nobody thinks I’m smart. Nobody worries about my mental health. I can’t remember one day that I wasn’t crying in class for whatever reason. For example there was this day that everyone got in groups and i was left alone and the teacher says who’s gonna allow me to join their group and nobody obviously wanted me so i just stayed alone and was almost crying. I just don’t understand why doesn’t anyone want to be friends with me like am i that ugly  am i that unapproachable  am i that wierd. Also whenever something cringe happens in class involving me  all i think about is my friend how I’m making him feel uncomfortable because who would want to be friends with a cringe guy. I can’t believe this is reality. I was always so friendly and so energetic and so talkative and now i cant even have a conversation with someone. I hate myself. Im always in my room and always hoping my phone ring and it would be some of my old friend so we could talk or play together. Like i dont know to explain this but the only person i can talk to is that one friend and i try to do the most yo make him happy even though most of the time i think im annoying him.

My entire existence revolves around pain and suffering. Periods  child birth  etc. 

Im not as valuable or as important as men. Just an object/ baby making machine. I’ll never be seen as a human or worth anything.

mentalhealth,I hate my life,"I'm Fifteen. I'm five foot 1. Throughout my life I've been ridiculed for being short. Now I'm being ridiculed for being fat. Everyday. I look at myself in the mirror  and feel repulsed by what I see. I don't have anyone to talk to. One of my friends  or who I think is destroys my confidence everyday. He considers it teasing. And I don't even have the guts to tell him how I feel. Someone screws me over  I'll say something to them and then be ridiculed. Picked apart. Stare at the wall until I have an ounce of respect. I enjoy the game clash of clans. Always try to get better at it. I'm ridiculed for it. They call me fat. A loser. That I have no friends. I feel so alone I have a better time chatting to my clan than at school. I used to be the funny one. Now I'm the punching bag for everybody. Except when they need help with work. I work at McDonald's. This I am also ridiculed for. I try to cut out the crap food from the canteen. Ridiculed again. I can't tell my mom because five minutes into the conversation I would be in a mountain of trouble. I can't tell my Dad  he has too much to stress about at the moment. Every Monday I come in  ready for another week of this. I used to be good friends with them. Till another kid came along. Took them all of five minutes to shove me out of the way. One trick pony I am. I spend most of my time on my phone  playing clash of clans watching YouTube watching shows. Working on my story. So I don't have to face facts straight and realise I have nothing. I leave and they'll forget about me in a few weeks. I stay they'll have something to ridicule. I don't do sport. I don't do outside activities. My life sucks. One of my greatest experiences in school was camp. Because I actually made some experiences. No-one else wants to talk to me except the group I'm in. If they want to at all. Screwed the pooch with that. I'll never amount to anything  hell the peak of my life was year six because I had people I could trust. Some days I feel so alone I could cry. But I can't. I have to let the days keep on coming by. I don't matter to anybody except my parents. Hell even my brother barely cares. Tells me to hit gym or just tried to annoy me. A life like this doesn't feel like a life. I've let my childhood go by whilst doing nothing. Now I am in the middle of teenager years doing nothing. I've wasted away the old person that was left. I've swapped attitudes between each school. Someone I struggle to find the real me under the masks I wear. Sometimes I wonder if it's because the real me shouldn't be found. Because I would have to realise how far I've strayed. How deep I've dug.

mentalhealth,I HATE how comfortable my life has become. It’s slowly killing me…,"I hate my job. It’s meaningless work — long night shifts where I get paid for doing almost nothing. But somehow  my life feels comfortable. And that comfort is slowly killing me.

No matter how hard I try  I can’t stay disciplined. Deep down  I know it’s me holding myself back  but I don’t know how to fix it.

A lot of young men feel the same — stuck in between. Life’s not bad  but it’s not good either.

And what scares me most is how easy it is to get used to this — to wake up one day and realize you’ve wasted years stuck in a life you hate… just because it felt comfortable.

There was a time — several months — when I was truly disciplined. I had a solid morning routine and structured days. I worked on my goals. I pushed myself out of my comfort zone every single day  and honestly… it felt great.

But suddenly  it stopped. I don’t even know why. I lost that discipline.

Ever since  I’ve been trying to get back to that version of myself. I change my routines  set smaller goals  force myself out of my comfort zone — and for a short time  it works… but then I fall back again.

I’ve worked so much on my mindset because I knew that was my real problem. But I still struggle with that

Now  I just feel lost. I’m 22  and I feel like a failure.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jiojwg/i_hate_how_comfortable_my_life_has_become_its/

I've had depression since I was in 7th grade(13) and now it's just been getting worse(I'm 15 now) but recently I've been getting better and going out more but I just don't think I'll ever be able to be normal again  in 8th grade when I left I actually had things somewhat good and I just blew everything off like I could get the things I had again after I had already left school and that's where things changed and I got really lonely   and hopeless because it's basically impossible for me to work on any school work without a teacher  and my mom is always working and my dad doesn't do shit and he never has my entire life except smoke pot.

Last friday i had a panic attack again and it got REALLY bad i thought i was going to die so i called 911.

I was sure something was wrong with me and that i was going to die. My heart was going so fast  i had a horrible headache  my whole body was shaking  i had extreme dizziness and i couldnt see straight (everything was blurry/blacked out). It took me about 15 minutes to actually call 911 i kept thinking i was having a stroke or something. My thoughts about dying wouldn’t stop and i kept repeating “i dont wanna die” over and over. Calling 911 was scary on its own  cause it was the first time i was calling. I told them what was happening and while crying and barely controlling my words.

The first responders came and took my pulse and walked me through my breathing  i was shaking so bad. And then the paramedics came and took my vitals and they told me i was fine  they reassured me that it was probably a panic attack and i wasnt about to die and they told me my uncontrollable shaking was probably due to adrenaline... It’s my finals and im stressing so much about my exams and i spent the whole day at the library and barely ate  so looking back this was definitely because of anxiety.

mentalhealth,Does anyone else feel like trauma triggered panic attacks vs anxiety triggered ones feel ‘different’?,"I have no clue how to word this or if anyone will even understand what I mean by this but I can tell the difference in both. I know it isnt panic vs anxiety attack  I have had anxiety attacks before and this isnt them.


With my trauma triggered panic attacks they’re always very very extreme. Like i get violent and will throw myself against walls to snap myself out of the intense panic and dread i am feeling. It’s so hard to explain but i just feel myself going so fast its almost as if time has stopped. I will run around and scream at the top of my lungs and maybe even throw myself against things (it happens sometimes  not always). It’s very extreme and dramatic.


But with my anxiety triggered panic attacks (not anxiety attacks  as in panic attacks triggered by my diagnosed anxiety) it isn’t so extreme and violent. It’s still horrible and i feel so much dread  but it isn’t at all like my trauma triggered panic attacks. I will get this immense feeling of dread  like im about to die and then ill rerun the thought over and over. Eventually itll pass. But in the moment its like witnessing something scary. Like someone is running at you  trying to attack you. That intense feeling you get and it stays up there. It stays in that height  but it isnt so scary. It’s almost calm. Like an eery dread.


I have no idea of I’ve explained this well or not  and im not sure if anyone else relates. But i just have no clue if im alone on this. I have no idea if anyone else experiences this too. I dont know what could cause it or if thats just what happens with trauma triggered panic attacks. I have no clue.

All of the symptoms happened within 30 minutes to an hour. I thought I was having a stroke as I currently have a DVT (blood clot) in my leg from a long flight I had 2 months ago. DVT is being treated and I am on medication for 6 months. 

I went to the ER where they did blood tests and a heart test  everything was normal. They had no answer to what happened or why I felt that way. The symptoms started fading about 2 hours later and the tingles/ numbness in my face was last to stop at around 3-4 hours later. Can this possibly be a panic attack?

I never held interest in things I actually liked because they would laugh at how supposedly stupid it is. Or that I wasn’t able to do it.

mentalhealth,My two year long celebrity obsession ended and now I feel empty,"I (16 F) have been extremely obsessed with James Hetfield from Metallica for about the past 2 years. Looking back  the obsession level was definitely to a very unhealthy point  as I struggled to find anyone my own age attractive. Everyday I would have to watch edits or videos of him to fall asleep or wake up  and I have ever experienced this for anyone else.

I don't know why the obsession ended but over the last few weeks I definitely recognized it slowly declining. I am aware that this is probably better for me and l was bound to grow out of it eventually  but I still feel really hurt by it. I want to love him again so bad  but I just don't get the same feelings or reactions anymore. I still love Metallica but I really want to feel the obsession over James Hetfield again.
Even though it seems really insignificant  that feeling had a really big impact on my life. As someone who had struggled with gender in the past (I was born female but didn't feel comfortable with that for a while)  it allowed me to more easily accept my femininity. I know this seems stupid but I am genuinely so upset with this change.",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ixltml/my_two_year_long_celebrity_obsession_ended_and/

mentalhealth,I keep dreaming of dying in excruciating pain physically and emotionally but want to stay in the dream.,"**FICTIONAL DREAM VIOLENCE**

For example  last night I dreamt that I was descending a tower with some family members (not from real life) and a random guy called Eric. And then my uncle was just killing all the ""corrupted people"" by mentally penetrating them and destroying their hearts  causing them to just die instantly. Then by the end  black veins started crawling out of my skin  and he was debating if he would have to kill me because I was one of the last 4 alive (including him). We were all training to get stronger to survive and Eric just kept saying ""She's corrupted! What are you waiting for? Kill her!"" and both me and my uncle were crying. Then he did it and I stayed in a dark blank dream until I woke up. **The entire time  I wanted to stay in the dream  even though I knew I was going to die.** Is this maybe a sign of being a masochist? I'm not too sure what's happening  and I'm curious on what you guys think this is.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1hm8mcn/i_keep_dreaming_of_dying_in_excruciating_pain/
mentalhealth,Can’t live  but don’t want to die. I’m scared of the pain.,"I’m at a point in my life where I no longer want to die. There’s something beautiful about the fact that I was capable enough to achieve that  but now I’m stuck with the issue of looking ahead and realizing that  in all likelihood  it’s going to be one very long and cold corridor from here to my death. I have spent so many years trying to do better  trying to be the kind of person who can at least exist well enough to take care of myself  to be able to show up for others occasionally  and take care of those that depend upon me  but still I find that I can barely get out of bed and make food for myself most days. I’m mentally ill  and I have so much chronic fatigue and pain due to this and my self-inflicted health problems  and many parts of myself are actively deteriorating in front of me. 

I continue to miss out on all the experiences a person should have  the same way I did for my whole adolescence. I don’t know why it’s so hard to get better  but all I seem capable of is watching time and life pass me. I can’t engage with a single aspect of living without undergoing an unbearable level of stress  exhaustion  anxiety  and physical pain. I’m not sure what to do. Eventually  the people who care for me that I kind of live off of are going to run out of steam. What do I do then? Am I going to end up on the streets? Or  perhaps  will I be living a life where every day is a miserable cycle of living one anxiety attack to the next  barely making deadlines and clinging onto whatever employment I can hold by a thread? Will that make me suicidal again?

I just want to feel okay. To be able to shower  walk my dog  clean the house and eat  without burning out and sleeping for a week. I want to find a job and start pulling my own weight  taking the pressure off my caretakers to care for this grown adult who refuses to act any more mature than a child. Not even counting the actual dreams I had for my life  or whether or not I’ll be able to experience relationships or sex. As it stands  I can’t juggle basic tasks like eating healthy  getting my daily steps  caring for my dental hygiene  and doing laundry. 

My depression isn’t existential  it’s based in my reality. I don’t want to be in pain for the rest of my life. I don’t want others to be cleaning up the messes I make of my own life forever. I know I put myself here with my own self-negligence  but I don’t know how to claw myself out. It’s so hard. It’s so hard.

mentalhealth,My brother is the reason I want to end my life,Me (23F) and my brother (30M) were raised to be devoted Muslims  and were taught that homosexuality is a sin. My brother and I were close especially since I knew he was also struggling with depression. We were there for each other. But ever since he came out to me in 2020 as gay  I couldn’t look at him the same way. At first I was supportive because I labeled my self as bi  but now I’m sure I’m straight. I keep asking myself “if I can change why can’t he?” I’m sad  angry  and scared. I thought of ending my life because I don’t think I can live with all this pain and heavy weight. 2 weeks ago I admitted myself to the hospital because of serious self harm and suicidal thoughts right before my brother’s 30th birthday.

mentalhealth,I feel like I’m ready to end it…but I want to prove the universe wrong. ,"I’m an international student studying in Canada. I used to study in Australia as a BsC at mechatronics at the University of Melbourne but I couldn’t handle the pressure. I didn’t feel motivated. Being so far away from my family…it’s so painful. I can physically feel it. After not being able to cut it  I confessed to my parents that I couldn’t handle science (event though I had A stars in my A-levels)  so I am now studying BBA in Canada at BrockU. During that time  my dog died…my first and only amazing pet. She suffered while I was fucking away in a far away land. She was in pain. I am a failure. And after that  I went into a depression  failed numerous subjects in a semester  and my uni told me to study BA and kicked me out of the BBA program. 

Right now…I’m renewing my study permit as I had a limited permit due to a tourist visa I applied in 2014. But now  I have to submit a Letter of Acceptance with my program  and expected end date to the IRCC. My parents don’t know I got kicked out. I’m afraid…I am a failure of a son. They are the best parents to support me throughout all this shit show and everyday I feel responsible for wasting their money  their hard earned money.  On someone like me…as I’m writing this  I am drunk. Because I know sober me would never confess such feelings. I would rather die than express my emotions. Now  as I am about to submit that paper to the IRCC  they will find out about what happened…and to be honest  I have been imagining my death all this time. Suicide note on my table  my gifts for my girlfriend on the table  scheduled emails to my friends  and…tbh…I feel so happy. Whenever I imagine my death. My mind…is so fucked up. 

I was struggling to breathe when I was born….and a part inside me thinks…I should have died that day…rather than continue to live on. Asthma  average grades (southeast asian parents)  sister who looks upto his brother  and so much. My friends are getting jobs  my sister is closing the gap between uni and me. My graduation still 10 months away. I am afraid…that I don’t have enough strength in me. 

I am a Hindu but tbh…my mind is filled with so much doubts over myself  I feel fake. I can’t even pray to God without feeling fake. I feel like my god is judging me…thinking how pathetic I am. Idk guys… I can see myself… in my bathtub  hands cut lengthwise my hands rather than sideways….and tbh …happy. I tried talking to a therapist with my issues to a person at BetterHelp but she told me that she can’t help me. Am I that pathetic?

I just wanted to give my family the joys of life that they have given me. I just wanted to be a good son  a good brother  a good boyfriend  and maybe a good husband and father one day. Is it too greedy to ask such things?

Everybody is now involved in my life and I don’t want them to be. It made everything worse.,I’ve detached myself from anything I love and yesterday as soon as everybody got involved  I instantly made clear that I would not talk to them anymore. The person that called was the person that I think would say my life  but I know that they can’t and I know that I wouldn’t put them through that  I don’t want help. I don’t want attention. . I don’t want help. I don’t want attention. I just wanted to put this out there. I just wanted to put this out there. yes this person could fix everything and I’m sure that would make me happy again because for the first time of my life after all the smiling depression I know people don’t understand  but my brain shows that person because it was the only time I’ve ever been happy in my life and not felt this way  but the only reason I became better was because of the way I feel and due to sickness and a few other things  everybody possibly could have from them and told them they should probably do the same now i’ve detached myself from one person all I could help me and have attempted suicide to get away from them and make sure that nobody ever feels that pain again now that after yesterday  please family members work friends everybody found out how I was feeling and got involved and it made it worse. I don’t want to go to a psych ward. I don’t want to go to a mental hospital because it won’t help as soon as I get out it’ll feel the same way there’s no medicine there’s no therapy. There’s nothing that I could really have done or have done already that has even came close to fixing it just being happy in that one place was it  but I ruined the relationship due to sickness due to a few other things and me  knowing that I was going to screw it up anyway so why not I had to let her be at peace think this might be a cry for help or it was for attention  but it was not it was the opposite I didn’t want anybody to know. I don’t want anybody to know  but it’s out now facing  but I know how I feel and I know that I just detached myself from everybody to make it easier and there’s always a calm for the storm and I think I’m trying to make everybody remain calm now  I don’t know what this is. I don’t want attention. I just wanted to put this out there into the universe something ever happened. I’m not out of my mind. I’m not harm anybody.

I suffer from autism so it's easy for people to do that and it happened to me with my recent ex girlfriend  convinced me she liked me and that I'd have a chance at being happy in a relationship only to make me believe I sexually assaulted her  manipulated her and lied about loving her. my feelings are always 110% true to whoever they're towards and its always been like that  good or bad.

 After we broke up which was a few days ago she constantly acted like she still loved me but then told me she didn't  turning all my friends against me  threatening me and trying to get me mad so she can get a reaction out of me and get me into more shit.

she has made things unbearable for me. I've always wanted to end my life since I was a little kid but now I feel an even stronger urge  I relapsed after 4 months (sh) and I smoke weed nearly daily just to stop thinking about everything. it's like every time something good happens big or small I get a gigantic fuck you straight after  I have autism  adhd  anger issues  obviously depression and anxiety diabetes t1 and just recently been tested borderline positive for celiac disease. 

i genuinely don't think things in my life can get much worse I'm only 17 and I already feel like I've done all I want to in life  like I'm giving up basically.

mentalhealth,I want the pain to stop,"(M28) I dont really know anymore where to turn to  so im trying effing reddit now.
I have planend my suicide in 2 weeks  i have written a note a i know how i will do it.

When i was 21 my father hanged himself  after being a drunk and abusing our family verbaly for years before hand.
A year later my Mom told me  her new boyfriend would move into our house.
I got told my entire childhood  that there was no money for me to go to college or take music classes  because „when the House is finished  you wont need to worry about that.“

Her boyfriend now has my car-workshop and i had 1 room i could live in. I started taking drugs after that  because nightmares of my father and the betrayl of everything my parents promised me  didnt let me get sleep.
MJ and/or alcohol were the onlythings that did.
I live in my own Apartment for 2 years now and iam clean.
But i am losing my Friends  and i think iam a monster because i can only get fuck-relationships on tinder etc.
I never had something that went longer then a month. Probalby because i dont trust anyone  since my „best friend“ cost me a lot of money  because he would rather smoke weed  then to finish Deadlines.
I cant get Therapie because i work for a living  so the german healthcare System says „You Pay us a big slice of your paycheck  so please Look for a therapist with your own money.“
The only thing that prevanted me from doing it so far was a girl im friends with.
She is the only Person i really feel love to anymore  but telling her would only hurt her  when i end it.
We See each other every weekend and go to concerts and events together and watch Movies.

Well last week she told me  she would Drive to Frankfurt  to get fuck by some dude.
 After that i chose to end it.
Not because she is the way she is  but because i will always Fall for people who just use me.

I have on more Friends  my Family doesnt give shit and i dont what to take drugs anymore  because it just makes me feel shit  not high.

I cannot go on anymore. I really cannot  nobody seems to understand  I don't think anyone actually listens I dont  think people care about me  they care about their feelings.

My parents think my diagnosis is wrong and that I’m faking it  but I swear on my life it is all very real to me  and I’m being very genuine when I describe what I’m feeling.

I'm 24F  struggling with my mental health since I was 13. *eating disorders  depression  anxiety  panic attacks & OCD*. was diagnosed with em all.

in 2018  I left school 1 year earlier because I just could not handle school & mental health together anymore. I was also bullied in school which made it even worse.

I'm unemployed since then. oh how I wish I would not go through all this and be just a normal human being with a job  friendships  relationship etc. there's nothing I want more. Not everyone knows my situation. not even family members like aunt  uncle etc.

if you ask them  I'm just a lazy piece of sh\* who just does not want to work. *oh yeah  it's so funny being almost 25  with no friends  never been in a relationship  no job  literally no life. so funny.*

Luckily  my mom is supportive most of the time. But she get's brainwashed from my family members who always tell her  what a lazy daughter she has  how long she can handle me at home etc.

yesterday I secretly listened to a phone conversation my mom had with my uncle. btw I opened up a little bit about my situation to my uncle about a week ago. He seemed really understanding actually. But yesterday I heard him saying: *""she's just overexaggerating  she needs to get a job just like a normal human being  how long do you want to take care of her? and she needs to stop being so anti social and get friends or whatever. she's literally locking herself in her room. just lazy. she's so used to that comfort.""*

I already had a bad day yesterday  so after this I had a mental breakdown and cried for 3 hours straight in my room. nobody cared obv. I don't know how long I can handle all this anymore. does it ever get better? please tell me it does.

p.s: will start therapy again soon  I'm just looking for a therapist  it's so hard to find one atm.

But i really need help and someone to prevent me from going crazy. Also please don't suggest getting mental help from a therapist because it's apparently a luxury.   
Long story short  My parents were and still are emotionally abusive (physically too in the past). My mom never loved me and always saw me as a show piece and took pride in my achievements. I did everything i could to make her proud but she never stopped from humiliating me in public. Hitting me  yelling at me in front of everyone. I always tried to be the best and was the best at studying (used to be a topper at school)  was good at singing  painting  you name it  i can do everything and did everything. Whatever she did to me  whatever experimental monster she had made  i thought we had everything. But she then cheats on my dad. And I was 12/13 when i found her sexting with her boyfriend. We had a huge fight and we started hating eachother. I still hate her. This is just the beginning. Idk what happens to me after the betrayal from my mother  i change and i become a bully. One of my close friends commit suicide and i still can't stop blaming myself. I stop bullying people but I can't help myself from the things i feel  hear or see. I had another manipulative best friend at the age of 14 and she humiliated me everyday and finally  leaves me. And then when i dated someone  they lied to me only to get to date me and then he cheated on me too even after he knew how bad the betrayal trauma was for me. Fast forward to now. Around 2019  my mom attempted su#cide and i entered the room and saw her trying to ha!ng herself. I couldn't move myself? I couldn't decide what i wanted to do. Crazy right? Did i want her to die? Then my sister arrived and then helped her. Last year i got badly sexually assaulted by three guys that i trusted. Now i have an extremely bad reputation and everyone looks at me like im a disgusting slut. And i lost all my hopes from people. And then my new best friend started dating someone  lets name the guy him Sean and my best friend Max. Max knows most of my things but not everything. Nobody knows i got s\*xually assaulted or that i almost hoped for my mother to die. For the last few months  sean and i figured out that we have the same traumas and we understand eachother. He was tired of his relationship and always felt like my bestfriend  Max doesnt understand him. But we both felt understood by eachother. it wasnt anything romantic but my best friend was jealous and envies me now. She hates me. And I dont want her to hate me but there's nothing that i can do. I love someone else but he treats me like an outcast which i am.  Sean was like a magical appearance in my life. We both helped eachother battle our demons. We could see eachother in us  like Shinji and Asuka from Evangelion. But all good things end right? At least for me they do. Idk what i did  maybe i hurt him or maybe i wasnt useful anymore. He doesn't want to be my friend anymore. He always told me that he has a lot of things planned for us (eg. travelling  creative projects etc). And he told me that he always wanted me in his life because I am a sister he never had and he was the same for me. Idk what i did  why do i keep hurting people and why am i so pathetic that i get betrayed. I hate Sean and I can hear his voice telling me things in my head along with my mother's and others. I can't stop thinking  my brain hurts. I am forgetting all the memories i have with Sean and Max. Now i am all alone  back to where i was with nobody by my side  just people who loathe me and i loathe everyone. I forget most of the things. It's like my brain has a defense mechanism  it forgets the hurtful part. I am going crazy  I keeping seeing things like the day my mother tried to k\*ll herself  i keep seeing them but they are all blurry and most of the details feel like a dream. I don't want to die  i want to vanish. I want to hide. I can't even cry because tears wont come out? I am so fucked up in my head. Everytime anyone touches me  they keep coming like a flashback.

mentalhealth,Nobody around me understands,"Ive never been able to properly articulate how I feel to someone else  so maybe typing it out will help.

I am in a loving relationship  and enjoy my job. But I have feelings towards life that no one else around me seems to have.  

Some days I wake up  totally fine  go about my day and don’t think about it too much. But some days  I wake up and feel every single second ticking away  and Im just sitting there letting life go by. Why isn’t anyone else freaking out about this? I look at the sky  the trees  flowers  feel the wind on my face - everything is so real  so alive  why am I not doing more with my life? 

I feel selfish  guilty  crazy  and alone. Its so weird to describe to someone else. I feel like screaming all the time - life is happening and everyone is missing it. Im dying. What am I supposed to do while Im here?",3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/bvt4m5/nobody_around_me_understands/
mentalhealth,I've had enough of fighting myself. I don't know what to do  what I want. Mental health is ruining me but it feels like nobody understands.,"Title may be dramatic  I'm not suicidal and never have been snd I don't really know why because it would be a lot simpler. I've chosen to hide my feelings most of my life until a mental breakdown 4 years ago leading to therapy.

I've battle social anxiety  depression most of my life. Always reluctant inside to do things with friends like holidays. I haven't looked forward to an event ever  I just chronically worry and torture myself with what could go wrong even stupid things like worrying about the location of toilets. It forced me to shut everything out and become a recluse who played video games and substance abuse most of my life. I had recluse friends who were in similar situations (hated the world and eventually stopped going out etc) 

I was a touchless virgin until 29  I had gone through therapy to deal with my problems and was at a stage I wanted to push out and experience things and not see myself as a disgusting mess that was a stain on society. I met a girl talking on mental health websites with similar problems and we ended up meeting and hooking up. This lasted for a year right up to now. We text and meet every month or so and fuck each other mindless. We are in a friends with benefits agreement  she doesn't want a relationship and honestly I don't think I do either but we've grown dependent on each other and are both struggling to end it.

We discussed ending it. She told me a relationship isn't possible because we're mostly physical and she doesn't trust that I'm not just using her for sex unknowingly out of my lack of experience and partners  and she could be right. 

I recently finally moved out of my parents  and my friends with benefits and I have planned to spend a couple of days together (usually we only spend a night together and it's mostly physical) great  right? Not for my stupid head. It's non stop worrying and panic attacks. Thoughts I'll stuff it up  I've never been a host  we'll just be sat in awkward silence. And the anxiety brings indecisiveness. Is this what I want  am I better off alone than being a burden  what minute I can't wait to see her the next I'm dreading it and feel I want to just be alone with my PC and drugs and booze. And it's not just indecisive on that  it's things like should I get out of bed or just lie in it safe from my problems  should I go shopping to get food or live off takeaway. Should I try and get my house tidy and ready for my guest or should I just end it with her to keep things simple. And the days fly by while I accomplish fuck all but procrastination. 

I just feel fucked. I need a new job but the act of getting one just makes me panic and worry that I just push it to the side. Am I happy at work? Maybe  maybe not. Meeting new people? Fuck that I'd rather live in misery alone than go through that. But why? I'll make a decision then completely regret it later.

And if the mental strain weren't enough  I'm constantly tired and my libido will be in tatters. And she'll want sex. I want sex but I can't relax and just enjoy myself anymore. I constantly lose my errection because of this shit going on in my head  second guessing everything. 

I don't expect anyone can help me  I should go back to therapy but it's expensive and awkward to arrange with minimal free time around work.

I feel fucked  lost  incapable of the basics of human interaction. I try to explain to my friends and family but they just say the usual ""stop panicking"" ""don't think about it that way"" ""just relax and stop caring"" but it's NOT THAT FUCKING EASY. Ffs. And the only one that does understand is the girl I can't decide if I actually want or not. The girl who I tell I can't wait to see you.. but in actual fact I'll be torturing myself and unable to sleep.

I honestly think my condition is pushing me towards being asexual  that the pleasure from sex and human interaction isn't worth the misery I put myself through. And a life of loneliness is best for me but that thought is just as depressing.

Thanks for listening anyway.

mentalhealth,Please someone show they care please,"Hey. Im a 15 yr old. And both my parents tried killing themselves.

My father is a prison officer and at the start of the year he went mental. I mean completely mental. No emotions nothing. He started saying to people hes going to kill himself. He went to a mental hospital for a while and was forced on medication which made him worse. 

My mum didnt understand it and had mental breakdowns every night and i was the person who had to support her. 

After them i went back to my room and broke down myself. I had NO ONE. I would cry for hours reading my dads old messages.

 He ended up coming back overtime but after a month he slipped back on the medication and he went mental again.

Once again my mum would have daily breakdowns. After 3 weeks of it. She took my dads medication for a week on the Sunday she cried one last time to me and i went to bed crying.

I wake up and the first thing i hear is screaming. I jump out of bed and catch my mum drinking wine and pills. Screaming shes going to kill herself. INFRONT OF ME. AND MY FUCKING SIBLINGS.

I call the ambulance and my grandad cause he lives close. I cry watching her leave in the ambulance. She ends up being fine but in a mental hospital. 

Comes back to my grandparents house for a day and slips some more pills again. Back to the hospital.

After a month both my parents end up back home and act like nothing happened. 

I got counselling from my school but they just ask about my parents not me. Nobody asks about me.

I started healthy eating going gym. Made new friends and dropped the old ones because they werent real friends.

On the daily my parents want me home but i cant fucking do it. I can be around my parents but not the house. Truth is i dont want to live there anymore. But it seems i eventually have to just because they are my parents. I cant tell anyone that though.

While out with my friends and some others i got flashbacks and felt horrible. The others i dont really like but they were just straight up callin me ugly (joke or no joke idk)

My mate LJ dont really like them aswell so we walked off. He started talking to me about this girl he likes in our group and how he was upset and i just broke down. I couldnt deal with people always talking about themselves he asked whats wrong and i told him everything about my parents. He offered me a hug but i just couldnt. I dont cry infront of others so it was very weird. I also like this girl in our group and LJ told her ab how i just wanna walk off and we went and talked. I didnt tell her as much and didnt cry. But after i felt horrible because now my friends knew about my problems and they said i can talk to them ab it but i dont want to seek attention. Its why i came to reddit.

My dads side hates my mums side so because im staying with my mums side they all cut me off. 

I still get messages from my parents and we get into constant arguments because i dont even want to stay a night with them. My parents have had major arguments infront of me which factors into it 

I have a fear of death  going crazy like my dad or doing horrible things. But sometime i get scared i might end up kms even though im scared of death

mentalhealth,I feel like a burden on others when i want to open up,"Currently 17 (year 12)  when i was young (grade 7-10) i had mad anxiety and depression and i was stressed about school and everything going on. I opened up to my mum about it (first time telling anyone i was struggling) and she was fine in the moment like i felt relieved and it was great. But about a week or so later she saw me not studying or something and said something along the lines of “dont come crying to me when… (idk)” but what stuck was her saying dont come crying to me after my most vulnerable moment and that lowkey fucked me up a bit because i was at the lowest time in my life when i talked to her  and she used it against me. 

I think this might be where my problems with expressing emotion stems from because i always have this fear if i ever want to talk to someone telling me that my problems are invalid  or that im troubling them with my emotions  or that they might use it against me (these 3 are the main ones that come to mind) 

Ive also been put under a lot of pressure from my parents and i constantly feel like im not good enough.


What should i do?

Side note: Ive recently been put on vyvanse and all of my problems are kind of coming back to me because its making me think a lot/overthink  its kinda wigging out my anxiety but like things have been good recently so i dont get it.

mentalhealth,I dont have any wants  and I feel like a burden,"I'm 14 and I don't know if anybody else feels like this but as of lately I just feel like empty  like when I get up  the only reason I do is so I don't miss school  and it's not cause of what my grades are  but I just don't want to be a burden. It feels like I only do something so that I please other people.

it's like I wouldn't do anything with my life If I wasnt told to do something and it's not like im emotionless  because I do laugh and feel happiness but that's only around my friends at school  I know it sounds stupid that I don't want to go to school but when I do  I'm laughing. I enjoy being around my friends but when I'm doing something not involved with them it just feels like all I'm doing is following instructions given to me and I don't know if that's a bad thing  but other than following instructions at school and at home  I just pretty much lock myself in my room and don't come out unless I have to go to the bathroom or eat. And in the moment I don't see anything wrong with that  but then time passes by and I realize I spent my whole day only watching anime and YouTube.

My point is It feels like I'm a waste of space because I'm not doing anything with MY life  I don't have any ambition to do anything by myself  but it's not like I don't like doing things  it's just that the things I like to do  like watching anime and pretty much nothing productive aren't good for me. And I know that and I want to change but I just don't even try to  (like right now I'm typing this instead of trying to do something productive but anyway.)

 Im just so lazy that I can't even think good things to myself  like ""I want to change"" or ""I want to be better"" and don't know what I want in life and I just feel I would be better off not existing because I do the bare minimum to anything I just keep my mom worrying and she struggles to provide and I don't want her to worry about me and I feel like her life would be easier without me. I just want to have a productive purpose in life or aleast want to want something (I don't know if that made sense but that how I feel) and if I go my whole life doing nothing  following instructions  being a burden  without at least trying to do something that I want  what's the point of even existing.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1iz9zm9/i_dont_have_any_wants_and_i_feel_like_a_burden/
mentalhealth,I Feel Like a Burden and Don’t Know How to Change It,"For the past 28 years  I’ve had to rely on government assistance and family support to get by. 

No matter how much I want to be independent  I feel stuck in this cycle of not being able to take care of myself properly. Basic things keeping up with responsibilities  looking after my health  even just maintaining a routine feel overwhelming.

I can’t shake the feeling that I’m just a drain on the people around me. I don’t contribute the way I wish I could  and every time I need help  it just reinforces the idea that I’m not capable of standing on my own. It’s exhausting to constantly feel like I’m failing at life.

I know I’m not the only one who struggles with this  and I guess I’m looking for advice or encouragement from anyone who’s been in a similar position.

mentalhealth,My family makes me feel like a burden and I can't take it anymore.,"I'm F(18) been suffering from mental health issues for years now. My family got evicted when I was 9 because my dad stopped paying rent. My dad moved into a trailer with his friend (and has been staying there since). While I had to move in with my aunt and uncle (with my mom and older brother too)  but then my mom and I left (my brother stayed with my one aunt and uncle) we and went to live with someone I went to school with  then we left months after that  then we moved into another aunts house  which I was abused in  then we got kicked out  and now we live with my uncle (my moms brother) and have been for the past 8ish years and he is an alcoholic and abusive. 

I can't even leave my room without him making comments or yelling at me. I can't make food  I can't shower  use the bathroom  can't even sit in the living room (because he apparently prefers to sleep on the couch rather than in his own room). He's walked into my room many times when he's drunk to yell at me  even choked my mom once for defending me when I was 11 and I had to stop him. My parents have been telling me every year by (whatever time) that they're going to find a place of our own and yet every time the time comes  it never happens and it's been 9 years since we lost our own house because of my dad. 

I graduated high school last year  so I'm always stuck in my room and only get to go out on occasions. Everyone always tells me to get a job  and I've been trying for a while now but I haven't been getting responses. I also can't drive because I've failed my driving tests  and even so my mom lent my car that my dad gave me to my aunt  without my permission. My cat of nearly 14 years died this month too  so I lost all I had pretty much. My dad barely takes me out and to my parents  I seem ungrateful because of the times he does  which is like once a month or if there's a special occasion. My mom also is always working and never has money because she'd rather spend it on her games and smokes and barely on food or taking me out. 


Growing up  I've always had problems keeping my hair not matted because it's curly and hard to take care of. I used to be decent about brushing it  then Covid hit and because I couldn't leave  it got matted. And my family would always talk about it as if I wanted it to happen  but I didn't and they know I have trouble too  especially with depression. My mom and grandmother always make me feel awful about it.

I asked my parents multiple time for a therapist  which they even said they wanted me to get themselves and they never helped me with that. Even ended up in the mental hospital 3 separate times  the third time  the guy told my mom what I said after I told him I didn't want him to (I was 18 at the time while the other 2 times I was a minor and they wouldn't tell my parents what I said) and he told her that I had no reason to be mad at my parents for going across the country while I  of course was locked in my room for a week and that I was immature for my age. 

At this point  I don't even know what to do. Everyone treats me like I'm a burden and nobody wants to help. And every time I bring up my concerns  they basically call me immature and invalidate everything and I'm sick of it. I just want someone to care. Sorry this was a bit long  I just needed to get everything off my chest. ",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1iw5d1n/my_family_makes_me_feel_like_a_burden_and_i_cant/
mentalhealth,Feeling like a burden,"I used to struggle with a certain feeling a lot more than I do now  but I watched a show that reminded me of it and realized it’s still there in me.

 

I had 3 friends in college. We were a tight knit group who deeply cared for each other. One of them became my first girlfriend (wlw)  and we were each other’s rock. We both struggled with anxiety and low self-esteem. I have a severe anxiety disorder with panic attacks and dependency issues. I over-relied on my gf and 2 friends to help me through this  something I have felt deep guilt and shame over. I had panic attacks twice a week. My mom is emotionally abusive  so my friends and gf were my only support system. I had a therapist  but that could only do so much. I could tell my friends were concerned about me; loving someone who is struggling that much is hard. I felt like I was ruining their lives. I tried to hide my anxiety from them  but I couldn’t stop asking for help. Panic attacks felt like I was dying and lasted for hours  sometimes becoming so bad that I couldn’t breathe. I hated myself for this and felt weak and pathetic. I wanted to be able to take care of myself so badly. To make it worse  one friend would mostly be supportive but say or do something that made me feel like a burden (ex: I said that I don’t want people to help me if they’re going through something themselves  and he said with a smile on his face  “Yeah! And sometimes I’m doing well  and I don’t want to sacrifice that  you know?”). I said to one of the others  “I sometimes wish I never made friends so the hurt would be limited to 1 person instead of 4.” I especially felt guilty for the anxiety I caused my gf. We were head-over-heels in love  so she got very stressed when I struggled. I supported her through a lot of stuff too  but I felt horrible when she wanted to (or felt like she needed to) take care of me.

 

My gf and I broke up. That friend who sometimes made me feel like a burden showed their true colors – too long of a story but it was bad. The other friend had her own struggles  and we grew apart. I was alone and it was hell. I fought my way through and made new friends  practiced healthy boundaries  joined the dance team  worked on my self-worth and self-sufficiency  and graduated college on the dean’s list. My anxiety was really bad  but slowly it started getting a lot better  and I went for months with no panic attacks. When I did have them  they lasted 5 minutes and I didn’t need help.

 

I’m in grad school now and loving life. I have a bunch of friends and haven’t had issues with becoming dependent on them. But I guess letting go of the feeling that I could ruin others’ lives if my anxiety gets bad again is hard. I don’t want to ask people for help  even in typical and appropriate situations. I hate when people worry about me. In the show I watched  a teen was crying because he was so worried about his boyfriend’s mental health. I felt this twinge that was like “that’s what you did. He’s so upset  just like them. Time doesn’t erase that.” It’s small  but it’s there. I’m wondering if anyone has advice on what to do about it. I’ve worked so hard on it  and it is wayyyyy better than it was – and time helps – but maybe there’s something I’m missing? I guess I’m worried about my anxiety spiking and falling into old habits. Having self-compassion for past behaviors and the harm I caused can be hard sometimes  even though I’ve improved myself so much.

mentalhealth,Should responsabilities always feel like a burden?,"For the past three years  I’ve been struggling with a heavy sense of responsibility  finding even small tasks overwhelming. I feel like I’m dragging myself through each day  motivated only by the fear of becoming irrelevant or disappointing my family.

The only times I feel at ease are when I’m alone at home or spending time with my girlfriend playing games  and even that doesn’t always help. Sometimes  I find myself watching videos without processing them  hoping to feel better  just falling asleep when nothing works.

Some days are easier than others  making it hard to understand what’s going on. Despite studying something that is interesting for me  I find tasks manageable but still feel drained by the end of the day  unable to find the motivation to repeat the process.

I haven’t sought help due to a negative past experience and the fear of overreacting  especially since I do feel okay at times. I worry that this is just adult life and that I wasn’t prepared for it. I also fear being misdiagnosed in therapy.

Years ago  I was diagnosed with anxiety but never received proper support or medication  which may explain some of what I’m feeling now.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ilvk0m/should_responsabilities_always_feel_like_a_burden/
mentalhealth,i always feel like a burden or annoying when i think i have made new friends,"(this does not happen to me with long term friends) 

recently i got into a new major in college after years of failure and ive been doing good and actually im happy with my choice

the thing is girls are the usuals in the class(we are usually like 10 when the class is not very important) which has caused me to start only talking with girls something im really not used to as until these days all my friends have pretty much been male with some exceptions

so i kind of started hanging out with this 3 4 group of girls and im so confused and feel bad because sometimes they pay a lot of attention to me and sometimes they seem to not care about me at all

some days they tell me lets go to the cafeteria or we even skip class together to go do something else and other times they dont even wait for me at the end of the class  which makes me feel bad when i wait for them because i feel like maybe they didnt want me there 

for example today i waited for them while they were in the bathroom and when they got out one of them said ""aw you waited for us"" and they basically didnt talk to me at all until i left and said bye and they didnt even say it back 

im a big overthinker and im also not used to be friends with women. guys are easy  you say hi to them 2 or 3 times and you got a friend forever  but i dont know the case with women. 

I really just want to stop thinking this way as i think it makes me pull people away from me and i really like this friend group i made now

also some other overthinking i do is maybe they think im interested in them??? i am a straight male but honestly i like a lot of things you could say are ""girl things"" But honestly i am not interested in them other than being friends 

this is just a specific case but honestly this has happened to me way more times in the past",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1irj40r/i_always_feel_like_a_burden_or_annoying_when_i/

After all of that I was just on autopilot all the way until graduation but that’s when things really set in. I started working in June as a caregiver and that was good for a while until the end of 
July when my clients family cut ties with the company I worked with so I didn’t have a client anymore atp. As this is going on I’m not sure at all what I want to do for school so I was just sitting at home rotting away my life then I decided to get invested in my weight loss journey which worked but I was still feeling depressed so from the end of July to mid September I was just at home all the time and I would go out every now and then but it wasn’t very often. Eventually I did get a new client by the end of September and that’s when I felt a little at peace again but this client didn’t require as much time as my other so my hours were cut extremely short. (Basically I went from working 10hr shifts 5days a week to 10hr shifts every 2weeks)  so I wasn’t making much money so I decided to try out DoorDash and that was going really good then I started working at Amazon but unfortunately it was almost 2 hours from my house and I couldn’t keep making that commute so I had to quit but luckily I was still doing my caregiver job then I got a full time client after that and that’s where things ended because the client had problems I couldn’t handle so I asked to switch and my manager said they would look for one but no luck. My other client wanted an older caregiver so I was cut from that one too. This was all in the beginning of December 2024 and since then I have been feeling like a waste of space and time.

I actually opened up to another person. I told them I’ve been struggling. I let them in on how low I’ve been feeling. And it wasn’t even hard! I didn’t even notice I’d done it.

mentalhealth,20 years old  feeling worthless,"Hi  I am a 20 year old male struggling with my place in the world. It is almost Christmas and the feelings of worthlessness are creeping back again. For some background  I graduated from high school in 2023. At the time I was 18 and not much different from today. Throughout school I struggled maintaining even an average GPA and would often procrastinate and take shortcuts to pass classes. It's always been like this.

I somehow managed to graduate though thanks to help from some teachers I appreciate dearly  and immediately jumped into college. I jumped between majors and struggled to complete work in my general education classes as I would have trouble focusing on texts and would regress to my old procrastinating ways. The stress from this would build up and eventually led to me dropping college completely. I hated myself for this  but at the time I just couldn't take it.

I would often get extra help throughout school  I am not sure what is up with me  but it is entirely possible that I am on the autism spectrum. Throughout all my years in school since I was in elementary  I have heard talk about it regarding me and my behavior in class. I have always been a little different even I admit. This isn't an excuse for anything  but I just thought it would be important background information.

I am now an adult and man I sure don't feel like one. They often say ""Comparison is the thief of joy"" and I think that is definitely true in my case. I compare myself to my peers and often feel embarrassed and ashamed. They are all so much more ahead of me in life  from my perspective at least. Right now I am applying to jobs but haven't had any luck whatsoever. I am learning to drive but procrastinating getting a license as well(shocker).

I think that I am just a lazy and unmotivated person. I always start off strong in my goals  but it ends the same every time. I wish I could change  I wish my self esteem was higher. But I don't know how to change things. I don't even know why I'm posting this  I just honestly needed to vent really badly about it.",14,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1h3wc64/20_years_old_feeling_worthless/
mentalhealth,Feeling of being worthless and not doing enough,I’m a 25 yo male. I have a 25yo girlfriend. Just recently (within a year and a half ago) I was injured at work that lead to me being on workers comp. Currently a year and a half later  I’m still on workers comp (long story) but with being on workers comp  I haven’t had a steady income anymore. In the beginning  I was getting weekly pay checks  bills were getting taken care of but now they’re fighting me on it and have stopped my benefits until my lawyer sees a judge to reinstate them. I thought I’d give background knowledge before I get into how I feel. Recently  my girlfriend and her family (I live with them btw) have grown more and more anxious and agitated at me not getting paid and taking care of my bills. I’ve done everything I can to take care of it (emptied 401k  borrowed  sold personal belongings) but it’s never enough. My girlfriend has started to lose interest in me physically  emotionally. I started to go back to school (which I’ve done exceptional in with straight As)  so when I get back to normal  I can get into a profession and have a better source of income than I’ve had before but my girlfriend keeps hounding me about how am I gunna pay this  when will I get money  etc. and it’s starting to really get to me. I’m starting to feel like no matter what I do in my life  I’ll never do enough or be enough. I’m doing everything I can given my situation. A lot of this situation is out of my hands and I can’t control a lot of it. Anyone have any thoughts or suggestions or any opinions.

mentalhealth,Feel worthless and as if ive lost my 2nd battle with PTSD and depression,"Typing as a way to try and calibrate my mind. My depression issues are back in full effect and are as bad as they were in 2017 when i attempted to end my life.

Lately  i feel like ive changed. Ive lost my ability to stay composed and calm. I randomly get angry and lash out at my spouse (who does not deserve it). I continue to have night terrors and nightmares that has this evil voice telling me im worthless and must end my life. I try to avoid sleep cause of it.

 I have no friends and the only family i have that talk to me are my parents  who my father subjected me to years of emotional and physical abuse due to alcoholism(which caused and led to a PTSD diagnosis) (age 3-15) and constantly yells at me to tell me im ruining his life by asking to borrow money when i have no money to eat. (I moved out on my own years ago) and my mom who only calls me to talk about how proud she is of my younger brother.


The only good thing that has happened to me this year is us getting a new apartment. That quickly became a nightmare as the above tenant is so loud  it spiraled my depression out of control and causes PTSD attacks.

I feel like the world has closed in on me and im hopeless. I just want my suffering to end. I have no self worth. I hate who i am. I cant afford proper help and the psychiatrist who they did provide to me has used me as a lab rat and keeps giving me different meds  all of which have caused liver issues (medically diagnosed) worse depression and created an agry side of me.

I just wish and pray i will stop suffering. I can hardly afford to eat anymore and cant even afford different meds. Im so scared and feel empty inside. I cant handle another battle like i endured in 2017.

The myth is Canada offers free health care and help but the care you get for free is nothing more than people who wont let you open up and instead push meds on you. I even had a therapist tell me im selfish for ever considering suicide. 

I used to be able to call my Uncle to help me  but he unfortunately passed away in last January. He was the man who acted like a real father to me from day one. No one else cares about me it seems.

This is me venting and also crying out for help. I dont know how much fight is left in me. Im only 32 and feel like my life is over. To finish  i was diagnosed with PTSD  severe anxiety  Severe depression and ADHD.

mentalhealth,Just been feeling really worthless and unhappy lately,"I'm 31 and can't drive—never have been able to due to some medical stuff. I go through phases of self-pity and doubt  but lately  it's been hitting harder. Public transportation isn’t an option where I live  and it makes me feel pretty worthless at times.

I have to rely on others for everything—getting to work  going shopping  seeing a doctor. After work  I’m stuck at home because I don’t have the independence to go anywhere or do what I want. I’m single and want a relationship  but I can’t go out to meet people or even take someone on a date without help.

I run a machine shop for a living  but it’s in my parents’ pole barn. If something ever happened to them  I’d lose my business because I can’t afford to move it elsewhere  and I wouldn’t have a way to get to work anyway. On top of that  I feel like a burden to them—it’s hard for them to do things like take a vacation because they know I can’t get around on my own.",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1j0rc5z/just_been_feeling_really_worthless_and_unhappy/

mentalhealth,Feeling stuck and worthless,"I had a bad day today but really I’ve had a bad year or 2. I recently left my previous job of 9 years after having been in a new role for 1 of them. I was running a retail store and as soon as I got into it  it felt like the company was going downhill. I didn’t and still don’t have much experience in the role and it was honestly becoming too much. I would have anxiety just thinking about having to go into work the next day and felt like I was doing everything I could but still failing. I ended up moving to a new company with my manager  even moving to a new city nearby for it.

I definitely got shoddy training and I think my manager just assumed I could figure things out without needing help. One week of my training that I really could have used was spent helping another store essentially tidy up. I was assigned a mentor who never reached out to me until over a month in and even then was not helpful. I feel like I’ve expressed that I need more support and I don’t get anything. I have worked 12 hours most days and when I feel like I’ve done something worth showing/celebrating  I don’t get any reaction from it. I do think I’m just emotional but as an example  I shared a setup all stores had to complete and my picture was the only one my manager sent a thumbs up to instead of a heart. I’ve also been asked by him to send a message to the other managers in the district and got ignored; he even sent the same info to the same group chat as if I didn’t say anything. I did confirm with another manager that the text was actually sent and it wasn’t an issue on my end.

Basically I regret taking this higher position and it’s not even something I’m passionate about. I know I need to quit and find something else that I actually enjoy but I also have bills to pay and am worried about not being financially stable. I know I could do it because I have to but I also want to give it a fighting chance. I just have a hard time knowing when to let go until it’s already taken a huge mental/physical toll on me. I also don’t have a degree and have no desire to go to school so I’m worried about what job I could even find right now. I know I would probably never see these people again but I also don’t want to look like a loser who gave up just a few months into a new job.

I guess I’m just looking for advice and also just wanted to vent.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ikedsc/feeling_stuck_and_worthless/

SuicideWatch,Switching From Passively Suicidal to Actively Suicidal Actually Gave Me Relief?,"*Has anyone else had this feeling? Or find it somewhat relatable?*

I \[24M\] have been passively suicidal for a few months now  but yesterday was an exceptionally awful day. I slept super late  I forgot I was scheduled to work  couldn't get dressed  couldn't leave the house  tried to fix my bike but ended up breaking it even more. Then I gave into pretty much all of my self-sabotaging vices (drugs  porn  shitty food  video games  you name it). 

  
I swear something snapped. I cried a *ridiculous* amount throughout the day and spent the rest of the night feverishly reading up on suicide. I actually figured out my gameplan. I found a whole document outlining the specifics and answered all the little questions I had (sorry not sharing — don't even ask me) plus a backup option in case I'm desperate enough to do something quicker. For now  I'm in the stage of acquiring the materials and getting my affairs in order.

  
Since I got my suicide method figured out  I'm in a strangely upbeat mood. 

It's an odd paradox. Finalizing my plan of action to end my life made me feel motivated to go out and live it. I'm getting chores done with no sweat  I'm dancing and listening to fun music  I'm gaining bits of my personality back. A great weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

From what I heard  it's common for people to act calm or joyful the days before they make an attempt. Is that what I'm experiencing? Maybe it's because I have a goal now? Like my days don't feel meaningless like they persistently have? Or maybe finally there's an escape route to break free from the shitshow that is my life. I don't feel as trapped and hopeless anymore. 

Anyways  I wanted to see if this anyone here had a similar experience or wants to weigh in on this situation.

TL:DR - I'm actively suicidal for the first time in my life and I feel much better after I figured out my method. What's the meaning behind this?

Depression made me dumb  uninteresting  made me stop reading books  made me stop learning  caused me to spend days like a zombie  caused me amnesia  literally caused my brain to shrink. But the worst was the effect it had after 15 years of fucking my brain. Now I lost my mind. Now i lost that quirky weird fun personality. Now i have lost the cultured nerd that i used to be. I had to grow up getting bullied for being a nerd  for being weird  for not poisoning my mind with mindless activities and TV.

Then I grew up and I lost all of those qualities that were supposed to make me have a cool life and cool friends finally. I wanted to be in the art community  going to talks and book readings and exhibitions and come back from it open a bottle of wine and drink it around the aged wooden table which stands in the middle of the living room that is surrounded by weird and classic paintings  contemporary sculptures and talk about philosophy. I was supposed to be the cultured smart weird but interesting guy. I WAS THAT GUY. I was born to be that guy.

But depression fucked me. And for the past 5 years I had set the goal to become that person again. The real me. But i have not only failed but I have rotten even further. Depression is a disease and has to be dealt with early on  otherwise there's no point in living like a half vegetable  high on antidepressants during the day and sleeping while on benzos at night.

I lost 2 women I truly loved due to my depression. Due to them thinking that I was that cultured smart creative and deep thinker  only to find out I had nothing to talk about  I wasn't able to form arguments  wasn't able to debate on topics  hadn't read many books  didn't know anything about art or culture and was simply boring and dumb to them. It's my worst nightmare come true. People ditching and telling me I'm uninteresting. This was NOT SUPPOSED TO BE my life. I deserved to be loved and experience that love with her after years of patience  years of pain and sorrow. I persevered. I don't accept this anymore. I tried to change but it doesn't work. I can't read anymore. My brain is fucked and I've literally lost so many IQ points that i don't understand what people tell me. My brain is too slow. And while reading i forget the sentences i read after a couple of seconds so I can't connect them and comprehend the story. I live in the moment. I can only hold 5 seconds of life in my mind. I lost my creativity. My ability to imagine and see while my eyes are closed.

Oh my god we would have been so perfect for each other. She is my female version. I am her. And she is exactly the person I wanted to be. Maybe that's why I love her so much. And as mad and hurt as I am for the way she treated me  I really can't blame her for not wanting me. I wouldn't want this ""me"" either. But it hurts so much because i know how i used to be. I know how my life would have turned out without the depression. Its so fucking painful. A family member killed himself a couple of years ago and that was less painful. It was shocking but this daily constant pain  this living through my nightmares is unbearable.

SuicideWatch,Overwhelmed and suicidal,I am so close to the edge.  I’m 53.  Haven’t worked since my husband died in 2021.  Have been caring for my parents the last 4 years with my dad having passed in June of 2024.  Mom is not able to sit in her chair anymore and is laying in a hospital bed.  She is hard to take care of and it’s becoming harder after her most recent hospital stay.  It is my feeling that she needs more care than I can provide.  She goes to a nursing home but she is very adamant.  She is in stage 4 kidney failure and can no longer walk more than a few steps.  Which brings me to the intense suicidal thoughts I am having.  I just want to die and have all this pain and uncertainty end.  I miss my dad and I want to be with him and my husband on the other side.  I’m so close to doing it.  But I don’t want to hurt my mom.  But part of the reason I am hurting so much is her and the struggle I have with her.  I’m scared.  Of my thoughts. ,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1jrv74d/overwhelmed_and_suicidal/

SuicideWatch,Feeling overwhelmed specially at night,"
Last two years  I’ve been struggling with the fact that I am unattractive to women  and it’s been weighing heavily on me. During the day  I can usually distract myself by keeping busy—working  playing video games  or talking with friends. But at night  when everything quiets down  it’s just me and my thoughts  and it becomes unbearable.

At first  I was just sad about it. Then  I started crying occasionally. Now  it’s progressed to the point where I’m having suicidal thoughts  and I even find myself thinking about specific methods that i think would be possible for me. I know I wouldn’t act on these impulses right now because I have my mom to live for. But her health is in terrible shape after COVID  and I’m terrified of what might happen when she’s no longer here. I feel like I’ll have nothing left to hold onto.

To be honest I don't have an specific reason to write this post  just to write some of my thoughts I think",2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1itrgut/feeling_overwhelmed_specially_at_night/
SuicideWatch,I am overwhelmed by my senses,I get very overwhelmed easily by my senses  mainly sounds and visuals. I use most of my day practicing piano  which already is loud but bearable  because its music  and I also live at home. My dad is also home a lot and is very loud. He constantly burps and passes gas  which may sound foolish or funny for someone who doesn’t live with it  but it is unbearable to live with I think. His face and stare also sends shivers down my spine and I want to rip my skin off where ever his eyes land on me. I have told him to stop  but he says he can do what he wants in his house. ‘What  I can even burp in my own home?’ I have no solution to this and I already think living is unbearable and unamusing. My thoughts have no where to be and my head is constantly filled with a fog of distractions and worrying. I cant move  because I have no money or job for it. I have no where to go. I wish someone would just spend a few minutes reading this or commenting so my suffering/worrying can be some what freed from my soul.

SuicideWatch,I feel like everything I try to do fails and feeling overwhelmed (venting),"I’m just feeling extremely overwhelmed at the  moment and probably worse than I’ve ever felt (which is an understatement because I am depressed and have been for 8 years now). My issue is that I am actively trying to improve my circumstances and situation however it’s like every time I try a new hurdle or obstacle comes in my way and then I start to think maybe I’m not supposed to be here because I don’t understand why things must always be so difficult. 

So I have recently started a new job because I am so deep into debt so I thought increasing my salary would help and now I can see a way out of my problems. But now that I’ve been working at this new job  I’ve realised that I hate it. It’s so stressful and hard and the people are not that supportive or nice infact they don’t like me I can feel it and then also at the same time of starting this new role my family member then became so unwell and I’ve had to take time off to sort that out when I have just started. I can’t even concentrate at work and I’m new. I know that they must think I’m not serious but it’s hard to try and concentrate when a parent is sick and I’m worried that I’ll get fired. I have been transparent even before joining but ppl pretend to understand when they don’t.

I think I’m upset because I have felt suicidal for years now I had completely given up but I thought let me try one more time. I have tried to apply myself improve my circumstances but honestly if feels like every time I try to get ahead something will happen immediately to drag me back down. Life shouldn’t be this difficult surely. It’s like I’m meant to be miserable and honestly I just want to be happy. I don’t want constant issues and hurdles to jump over all the time it has been this way for so long. Then I start to think it’s a sign  I’m not meant to be here. I should really go and even that trying to leave it’s not easy. Because there isn’t a painless way so I feel stuck and drained and miserable. I don’t want to be miserable forever. But also I don’t know what to do. I will call the Samaritans this evening. I honestly want to live but it’s like I’m not meant to.

I'm so scared. it's so overwhelming and we don't know how to deal with it. on top of that my boyfriend and I have major issues and fight A LOT to the point where it gets physical. we are so toxic but still love each other to death. and hate each other to death. he just wants sex all the time to feel close to me and wanted and to get rid of frustration (that's all that helps him) but I'm too depressed and down most of the time to even want to talk nevermind have sex... so I get put in this fucked up situation where I end up having sex with him regardless of how I feel - and then end up feeling worse - just for him to fight with me about something else a few minutes after..... i don't know what to do anymore or even where to look... im sure being dead would be easier than this  but I would feel to bad leaving my family who loves me behind  incase they blame themselves or think they did something wrong when  raising me which is not the case - they are and have been perfect.

SuicideWatch,My brother is addicted to cuckold porn after being cheated on and suicidal. I need advice on how to help him.,"So I've posted this situation before elsewhere  but didn't get much advice and ppl thought i was fake 💀. but I'm lost right now and have no answers.

Basically my twin brother's ex cheated on him with a guy with a bigger dick.

He confided in me that after this happened  he feels sexually worthless. He's been addicted to cuckold porn. He's insecure in himself and his dick size  depressed  and suicidal.

He's so insecure and has no motivation for anything. His self esteem is so so low.

Hes also into some extreme stuff tbh. Like he told me he was reading porn/erotica on reddit where the wife fucked the husband's bully (the guy who used to beat up the husband in high school  in the porn)  and he got off to it harder than ever. And afterwards he felt like killing himself. I feel so terrible for him.

And he's not an unattractive guy either: he's strong  muscular  athletic af and a huge jock (was a former D1 wrestler and teammates with my husband)  funny  smart  etc. Even my girlfriends say he's hot  so im not just being biased cuz he's my brother. Oh  and he's a hero too: he saved me from being raped by my uncle when we were both teens.

And yes  he's been going to therapy. It's not working; he's still depressed  suicidal  insecure  etc. I've asked for help from literally everywhere  idk what to do now.

I can't sleep right now. Im so so worried for my brother. I'm worried he might harm himself any moment.

Any advice is much appreciated.

TL;DR: Brother's ex cheated  he's been addicted to cuckold porn  feels suicidal and worthless sexually. He's been going to therapy  but it's not helping.",15,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/v924zv/my_brother_is_addicted_to_cuckold_porn_after/

It’s an addiction I’ve had for around a year  already kinda wanted to die because of it  after my parents caught me I tried to talk to them about it and tell them it’s something I’ve been struggling with  rather than trying to help/support me they just keep screaming at me for how I’m such an awful person now. I’m a fairly devoted Christian  that’s about the only thing stopping me from suicide. That’s why I already hated myself for watching porn and being addicted  it’s extremely against the Bible and I couldn’t quit.

SuicideWatch,Why does nobody care about your life if the reason for suicide is chronic loneliness?,"[So this got posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1ju3tnc/if_i_dont_get_a_girlfriend_soon_i_will_kill_myself/) a few hours ago  and the response was frankly shameful. So many of us struggle with self esteem issues  loneliness  constant rejection  a host of significant sources of stress  misery  depression  eventually leading to suicide. So why is it ok to just brush it under the rug as though it isn't a problem?

I can't speak for that poster  but for myself all I ever wanted was a chance to be accepted and understood by someone that cared about me. I think about that experience I'll never have  how I'll always be an outcast no matter where I am or what I'm doing  and that I'll never know what it's like to be truly loved by someone. I consider a lifetime of misery from never being able to change this  and I consider it would save a lot of misery for myself and anyone who has the misfortune of coming into contact with me to just end myself

Does that mean my life is worthless? That by wanting to end it because of that it isn't worth even an iota of actual compassion for what I've lived through  day after day  year after year?

I mean if it's called suicide watch because it's there to watch people do it then I guess that would make sense.

SuicideWatch,I'm 32 years old and don't think I can handle the loneliness anymore. I just want a wife so badly  but I don't think it's ever going to happen.,"Ever since I've been young  the #1 thing I've wanted out of life is a strong  happy marriage  but for whatever reason I've never been very successful with women.  I feel like I have a tremendous amount of love to give  and I just want to find someone who loves me back and with whom I can spend the rest of my life.  I'm so lonely.

At my age  the statistical reality is that the majority of people who want to get married have already done so.  Meanwhile  I can't even find a girlfriend  let alone a wife.  I don't really understand what's so wrong with me.  On paper  I'm not perfect  but I don't think I'm unworthy of love.  I'm very highly educated (two doctorates)  and while my income isn't anything special  it's decent (~$150k).  I know I'm not attractive  but I don't think I'm repulsively ugly  and I'm not short (6'0"").  I will admit that I'm fat  but I don't think that's the main reason I've struggled so much romantically because I'm perfectly willing to date/marry a fat woman (in fact I'd actually prefer it).  And lord knows I'd gladly spoil the hell out of any woman who showed interest in me (I'd be perfectly fine with a stay-at-home wife if that's what she wanted).  And I'm not even picky; I'm pretty open-minded and willing to give anyone a chance as long as she doesn't have/want children (that being the one issue on which I can't compromise).  So why am I so alone when most people are able to find someone?  It's horribly depressing.

To make matters worse  there's no one whom I can even really talk to about this.  I'll probably get attacked for saying it  but I don't believe that women can experience loneliness to the same extent as men.  And if there is any woman reading this and thinking  ""You're wrong because I'm just as lonely as you are "" then I'll go ahead and prove you wrong.  I am **LITERALLY** willing to buy a plane ticket next week (01/29-02/02) to anywhere in the entire country  take any lonely woman out to a nice dinner  and rent a hotel room so we can cuddle and watch movies afterward.  And no  I'm not using ""cuddle"" as a euphemism for sex.  I genuinely just want to hold someone and have them hold me back.  But I can already tell you that no one is going to take me up on this offer  which proves my point that women don't get it because they have options  just not the ones they want.  But people like me have literally no one who wants them.

I've thought about asking a prostitute if she'd be willing to just snuggle with me and watch a movie without having to involve sex (from what I've read  they're sometimes open to unconventional requests like that)  but my therapist and my mom both say that it's just going to make me even sadder because it won't be real.  And they're probably right  but what else am I to do?  I don't want to live like this.  I'm never happy.  All I do is leave work and then just exist until I have to go back to work (I've never been someone who enjoyed platonic friendships).  So what's the point?  I've thought about trying to make it to 40 and then just shooting myself if/when I'm still alone  but I don't know if I can suffer like this for eight more years.  If it weren't for the fact that I don't want to upset my mom  I may have already done it by now.

Nobody's advice is actually helpful.  My therapist just keeps telling me things like  ""I have countless female clients who would love to be with someone like you "" ""I'll help you through the dating process "" and ""I'm completely confident that you'll find someone who wants to be with you after a few first dates.""  And while I do really like him  those things just feel like empty platitudes when no one is even willing to give me a chance at a first date to begin with.

If you've ever heard the Travis Tritt song ""Drift Off to Dream "" that's basically me.

She swallowed 12 tablets (I won’t name what) and started having delusions and hallucinations and then went into what I would call a psychosis. Scariest moment of my life. We are still in hospital where they are treating her for the medical side of things. She is mad at me for taking her to hospital and saving her and said she wants to die. There is no trauma  no history of abuse  she comes from a loving family and has lots of friends. I am so scared and I don’t know what to do. I’m scared she will feel this way forever and this will be her life now  in and out of hospitals. Or that she will succeed in taking her life.

SuicideWatch,Switching From Passively Suicidal to Actively Suicidal Actually Gave Me Relief?,"*Has anyone else had this feeling? Or find it somewhat relatable?*

I \[24M\] have been passively suicidal for a few months now  but yesterday was an exceptionally awful day. I slept super late  I forgot I was scheduled to work  couldn't get dressed  couldn't leave the house  tried to fix my bike but ended up breaking it even more. Then I gave into pretty much all of my self-sabotaging vices (drugs  porn  shitty food  video games  you name it). 

  
I swear something snapped. I cried a *ridiculous* amount throughout the day and spent the rest of the night feverishly reading up on suicide. I actually figured out my gameplan. I found a whole document outlining the specifics and answered all the little questions I had (sorry not sharing — don't even ask me) plus a backup option in case I'm desperate enough to do something quicker. For now  I'm in the stage of acquiring the materials and getting my affairs in order.

  
Since I got my suicide method figured out  I'm in a strangely upbeat mood. 

It's an odd paradox. Finalizing my plan of action to end my life made me feel motivated to go out and live it. I'm getting chores done with no sweat  I'm dancing and listening to fun music  I'm gaining bits of my personality back. A great weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

From what I heard  it's common for people to act calm or joyful the days before they make an attempt. Is that what I'm experiencing? Maybe it's because I have a goal now? Like my days don't feel meaningless like they persistently have? Or maybe finally there's an escape route to break free from the shitshow that is my life. I don't feel as trapped and hopeless anymore. 

Anyways  I wanted to see if this anyone here had a similar experience or wants to weigh in on this situation.

TL:DR - I'm actively suicidal for the first time in my life and I feel much better after I figured out my method. What's the meaning behind this?

SuicideWatch,I think I am a pedophile and I want to kill myself,"Yesterday I went shopping to a mall. I wasn't sure in which shop to go to. I saw barely teenage girl go to gone to a shop. Without thinking  I went there too. Then I started to feel like a fucking stalker.

I didn't try to even walk to her. I had to take distance from her  and forced myself to shrug it off. I then saw her with her mom  and I felt even worse.

I have OCD. But I don't think it makes me confuse underage girls online with women in their early twenties.

I remember how I have sometimes seen a hot ""woman"" online.

Then I've seen a post mention she's fucking underage. And she looked over that for me.

I have barely ever gotten such thoughts.

I feel so fucking shit about this. I want to die. What the fuck can I even do to change my brain. It's fucking retarded. Why the fuck do I sometimes find an underage person hot?!

Yes  age of consent is a societal construct. Biology is far behind that.

This doesn't mean it's ok to be a pedophile.

But what the fuck can I do about this?!

I just realized this about myself. I'm fucking crying now. I am so fucking done with life. I have never been accepted by people because I am fucking ugly and neurodivergent. I am already suicidal. And now I'm also a fucking pedophile. I can't fucking take this. I just want to fucking die. What the hell did I do to be born into such a person?! There's nothing I can fucking do!

I've thought that I've just been always the victim to people. Yeah  I've been done heavily wrong.

But I also realized that I don't even deserve love or acceptance. I don't deserve hope when I have a brain like this.

Never once have I ever tried to sexually even approach underage people  approach at all.

When I was a teenager  I found a girl 2-3 years older than me to be attractive. And there were another guy and we kind of played with her and her younger brother. I was underage too.

SuicideWatch,i told my mum i want to kill myself. she said  “ok  just don’t do it in my house.”,"that’s basically it. it hurts. i wish people didn’t romanticise a mother’s love so much because then maybe these words wouldn’t sting as much as they did. how is a teenager supposed to feel when the one person who’s apparently supposed to love them more than anyone and anything  doesn’t?

edit: 
yes  I totally understand that parents are just human beings...but when a relationship  any type of relationship  starts to cause damage to one and the other knows this but refuses to acknowledge it or somehow change for the better  then they simply do not care for the person. I only opened up to my mum about depression very recently though I’ve been dealing with it for a few years now. at first  I used to think the reason I was constantly hurt by her actions and words was because she didn’t know the mental state I was in back then so I never blamed her in anyway. but it all became too much that i impulsively told her everything and she still refused to do anything. she’s not empathetic in the slightest and she made it clear that whether I commit suicide or not doesn’t matter to her as long as  like I said in the og post  I do not do it in her house or say anything in my suicide letter about her that’ll give her a bad rep or get her in any trouble. point is  I thought I was suffering so much because I kept my feelings to myself. I thought sharing them raw with her would help even a little but it didn’t and I feel so defeated. people always say you shouldn’t keep these type of things to yourself but there’s comfort in that. giving myself the illusion that the only reason I hurt is because I keep it to myself hurts less than sharing it with others and realising that that hasn’t changed the way i feel. you don’t suddenly get better. it only stays just as bad or gets worse. 

and to anyone and everyone who’s sharing similar stuff  I’m sorry that some of your most treasured people aroused some of the most negative feelings in you. it’s okay to feel hurt but don’t let someone else’s decision to be a dick affect your own life decisions because in the end  everyone will be looking back at their own life and their own life only. make sure that yours isn’t just a reflection of what others have said and done to you.

i apologise if this is really lengthy I know I keep rambling I just wasn’t expecting this many people to see this. to everyone who’s tried to help or who’s hurting  you have a special place in my heart.

I have had people move places when I sat next to them. When I talk to people they have this look in their eyes that signals disgust. I have been made fun in front of my face on several occasions. I have been told I am ugly both online and in real life. 

It’s not an issue of weight. I have a healthy and normal body weight. I dress well. I keep my hygiene. The issue is my face. I have facial features and a facial structure that can not be improved through plastic surgery. 

I get so jealous of women my age. I keep constantly seeing beautiful women all around me. They have everything I don’t. I feel like an ogre next to them.

SuicideWatch,One year of efforts to fix my life and start over after losing everything and I'm still being rejected no matter where I go  what I try  or what I do to be noticed. I can't get a second chance at life. I'm at limit. There is no way I can keep on living like this...,"Sorry for the long post. 

I (25M) managed to make a life for myself after the pandemic (and after having a shitty past too). I graduated university as an engineer  I had a loving girlfriend that I wished to marry  I even got a decent job in automotive industry. Mistakes were made during the relationship and at the job since both were my firsts in the real sense  and I worked hard to fix them all. Things worsened on both sides despite my efforts (I even went into therapy)  and at the start of 2024 I was laid off and I broke up with my girlfriend  almost at the same time. No longer having funds cut my therapy too. I ended up ill and even spent a bit in the hospital because of a seizure. I can't afford psychiatric medication either. My family ended up in a poor spot  they can't help me with any of that  they even started to demonize me because of my mental state and how I act because of it...

One year later it's even worse. Applied to hundreds of jobs and got rejected or ignored because they only look at my limited experience and not at my skills  despite learning more stuff (even AI) and modifying my CV and cover letters constantly. Found no one else to date because no one wants anything serious anymore no matter where I look (not to mention being taken for a creep if I approach someone I like even at an event like comic con)  and also it feels like I don't fit anyone's criteria  and no one fits mine either. Casual stuff or FWBs/ONSs are not helpful and would make things worse for me. It's the way I am.

No matter how hard I try and whatever I do or learn to impress  i'm not being given a second chance at life. I can't go on like this  if I don't deserve it  if I really failed my ex and my former job so bad that I don't deserve any chance to start over  then why should I keep on living? I suffered enough  really. Enough is enough at some point no matter the age or whatever strength is there. I reached my limit. I learned my lessons and I want to start over and do better  but how if I can't get even one chance to do that?

Any hobby I had is boring and I find no pleasure in anything. I also had enough of hearing the same words over and over. ""work on yourself""  ""focus on yourself""  ""care for yourself""  ""it gets better""  ""move on"". Yes yes I get it but I didn't get that degree to do nothing with my life. And I certainly don't want to live on my own no matter how much some people insist it's worth it. I can't move on if i'm being stuck especially for this long. Support is rare because everyone around me has a life to live  a job to attend  a partner to love  someone even got kids (because of that I no longer wish to make any more friends).

I've been so stressed with school  keeping up with my social life and pretending everything's fine  i just cant keep doing it. Getting out of bed feels like a chore  making food is an inconvenience to the point that some days i don't even eat a proper meal. I cant even get myself to study for my exams i have tomorrow. I'm constantly overwhelmed by expectations and i don't even see the point of fulfilling them. i just cant keep going on like this anymore. i see no point in sticking around much longer  but i don't even find the motivation to end it. I'm so pathetic. i have no talents  no goals  no achievements. i have no reasons to keep on living and i wouldn't be missed either.,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1hf02md/16f_and_i_cant_keep_going_on_like_this/
SuicideWatch,Life is meaningless  I want out.,"I never asked to be born. I never did anything to deserve the circumstances to which I was born  yet I must bear the burden of that all regardless. I am incapable of achieving the things I truly want  so why should I even bother anymore? I keep trying to remember the stoics and ideas from Hindu philosophy about being unattached from the results of your actions  but I cannot get into that mindset. I find life absolutely miserable  and if I can't have anything to justify going through it  I cannot continue. If nothing is going to work out  why bother trying? I take no joy in anything that is reasonable for me to expect from life. Not even food tastes good. I can't even listen to my favorite album. 

Maybe I'll give it more time. Maybe I can't. It is very tempting to just go out and save everyone the trouble.",81,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1fq1w46/life_is_meaningless_i_want_out/
SuicideWatch,I feel like life is meaningless,What do we even do in life? Some of us are lucky enough to have a talent or skill that they use to do great things for others  become famous  make a lot of money  etc. But for most of us  what do we even really do that's significant? I feel like I'm just floating  working my 9-5  making meals  doing my best to mask how I truly feel. I have no real skill  nothing brings me passion  I just feel nothing. I'm numb. I've searched for years to find my passion or purpose but nothing ever feels right or I don't have the means to get there. I don't fit in anywhere. Not with family  or my friends  or at work. I'm simply existing  living paycheck to paycheck to just survive  waiting for the day my last breath will come and I'll finally have peace. I want my last breath to come so bad  I wish for it every day. I dream about it. I crave the feeling of closing my eyes and never opening them again. Every minute it feels closer yet so far out of reach. Every day I make a new plan of how I will fast track to that moment. I never go through. I'm not scared  I don't have some hidden lust for life that keeps me here. I just don't go through with it. I'm certain one day I will. That will be my favorite day.,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1jeidey/i_feel_like_life_is_meaningless/
SuicideWatch,Life is meaningless.,Few years back like around 5-6 years I was so naive and life was rainbows and heavens. Now it just feels like absolute hell. I have spent countless hours making it better but it just gets worse and worse. And sometimes when you give up  it suddenly feels little better and then to a new low. for fucks sake kill me. I don't think life is worth living. Even if I do achieve happiness or my goals  is it really be worth all this pain? I dont think so. At the end you just exist  the reward to work ratio is totally off  infact 0. I shouldn't have been born. Now Im just burdened with responsibilities which prevents me from killing myself. You try so hard even though you know that life is inherently meaningless but you have got to do it because you got responsibilties and the funny thing is that those hard working hours never pay off a bit and you just continue to suffer. I use to be naive like that but now I have given up upon all my dreams. Why life gotta be so hard man. I think death is truest form of liberation.

SuicideWatch,Life is meaningless and everything seems irreconcilable philosophically with living,"The self is an illusion; consequently  every pursuit is meaningless  as it effectively feeds into an illusion—since ""you"" don't really exist. One might argue that you should simply meditate your ""self"" away  leaving behind a set of non-propositional neurobiological drives that somehow create an experience of consciousness in which nobody is truly present. Yet  this state is somehow supposed to wash away existential thoughts through its entranced form of consciousness. However  on an existential level  this remains utterly meaningless and leaves no room for coherence in statements like  ""In five years  my goals are...""—which is essentially how most people structure their lives. For some reason  nobody seems to recognize that this is inconsistent with the truths about the self. I see no logical resolution to this problem  and upon investigating different philosophers' responses  the only truly productive answer appears to be to become a monk and entrance oneself in the non-propositional  although this doesn't seem satisfactory of reconssible with living a normal life in this world.

SuicideWatch,life is now meaningless and painful,"At what point do I just stop trying? Nothing ever seems to go well for me. The second I see a silver lining it's ripped from me like scab  leaving me to bleed. 
I know I have things in this life time that I should be thankful for or look forward to but I can no longer look at those things and feel anything but numbness or pain. 
I relapse and hurt myself to punish myself for the trauma inflicted upon me by others. 
I don't leave the house (can't leave the house) because I'm terrified of people and new experiences. Feeling humiliated every time I look in a mirror or read the calories on the back of a box knowing that when people see me they only see my size. 
I have no real friends  I'm used for emotional comfort until I have nothing left to give. 

Death seems peaceful  kind. An everlasting embrace by the stillness that is nothing.

SuicideWatch,Life is long enough to be torturous but short enough to make all suffering meaningless and unredemptive,"You live  best case  until 85  where you proceed to die of old age. You are then probably forgotten within 5-10 years  and certainly within the next 50-75 years. And what did you gain? Or accomplish? You may get a perfect score on SAT  go to Harvard  but when you die all your accomplishments go with you. We enter this world with nothing and exit with nothing. You could be Isaac Newton or Franz Kafka  but  when you die  why would it matter if you were super successful or the worst of the bunch? There is no postmortem reward or punishment waiting for you. And yet  despite living (in the best case for) 85 years  you were relentlessly tortured  subjected to suffering  mental anguish  distress  and pain  and for what reason? Is there salvation waiting for me  or is there just absolutely nothing? So why even live? Why be subjected to pain when there's no ""salvific"" purpose of it? I've been asking myself recently  _Is this all life has to offer? This is it? An occasional good meal  a pat from a friend  and a congratulative gesture? This is all life is: seemingly unrelenting suffering and boredom in exchange for a moment's relief via validation from others (which doesn't even matter in the end)?_ Let us presume that one of the Abrahamic religions are correct about eternal postmortem reward/punishment. If ""God"" decides to ""damn"" you eternally for living immorally  would this just not make ""God"" a demon for punishing a human who necessarily doesn't have perfect freedom (i.e.  completely uninhibited knowledge of the Good)  yet we are held to a perfect (i.e.  eternal) standard? So  if ""God"" damns you for eternity  then ""God"" has always been evil in righteousness' clothing. The idea of eternal damnation is so laughably stupid that my fear of it has been reduced to nihil. I used to have mental breakdowns over thinking I'm going to hell for immoral action. Turns out it was all in my head. The experience of religious mania. But I digress.


So why even live? If you're going to be forgotten within one generation  what's the point? And even if you aren't forgotten for generations to come  why would that even matter? What's the point of life? To suffer with occasional bouts of pleasure?",5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1idwztj/life_is_long_enough_to_be_torturous_but_short/

SuicideWatch,I'm tired of everything going wrong. I just want to be a good dad and provide for my kids  but nothing goes right.,"I can't take the stresses anymore. I work 80% of my time away  and when I'm home  my kids are defiant  mean  unruly  angry. 

Backstory.

I let my ex and her boyfriend move in because the economy is shit. They've been living with me and my 2 little girls for 6 months approximately.
Neither works.

I pay for everything. I work a minimum of 10 hours a day  sometimes upwards of 16. My ex and I have 2 kids  ages 6 and 3. She also has 2 kids with her boyfriend  ages 11/2 and 1 month.

The arrangement is they mind the kids except on my days off  and I'll provide for all needs.

Since they've moved in  my oldest daughter has slowly destabilized to becoming spiteful to the point of literally trying to antagonize everyone in the house. She'll be going absolutely bonkers  and if you ask her to slow down  she'll smile and amp up. If you try to ignore the behavior  she'll have a go at one of the littler ones. She refuses any request  tears up pictures we draw together (that shit hurts to my soul) screams at the top of her lungs if given a consequence like no treats or no tv. She's completely out of control. The second one  the three year old  is becoming nearly as defiant. Bedtime is an absolute battle. Meal times are negotiating for amounts to eat  or just wasting food  or throwing it  depending on whatever they decide that meal.

The oldest one goes to school  but the others don't. She gets up and gets ready  no problem  oddly enough.

Tonight was an exceptionally bad experience. I'm absolutely certain the neighbors a mile off heard everything  and I would not be surprised if I get a visit from someone for all the noise and crying.

It started off when I came home early due to the snow storm in our area the next few days. They were fine for about 20 minutes  happy to see me(they both seem so excited whenever I walk in  which is what makes everything so confusing). Then the fighting  the tantrums  the refusal to eat  or stop jumping off the furniture  or hitting each other. Lunch and dinner were absolutely insane  but at least they are a reasonable amount. Then  it was more insanity up until bed at 9. Then  more insanity  and it's just now 1am  and I finally got them to stop a few minutes ago. Their 11/2 year old is up  though   which he's just having a little go. They seem largely unbothered. No one helped with the girls tonight  even seeing the way they were acting. This seems to be the norm whenever I'm home  even if I have to get ready for work  so really  they get more time off than when I'm off. I did help with their kids  though. I always do.

I've tried the gentle parenting stuff at every juncture  and it used to work. Now  nobody listens unless I'm yelling. They never comply. I just have to wait it out  get hit  screamed at  demanded of for snacks and drinks and treats.  I tried everything. Asking  questioning if something was wrong  cuddling  playing  asking for help from my big girls to get things calm  attempts at redirection and distraction  begging  taking tablets and TV  explaining that I'm very tired and need sleep  more begging  and finally yelling. That didn't work either. Eventually  the only thing that got them to stop was a firm swat on the butt.

I hate yelling. I hate spanking even more. I now feel like a horrible parent and that is literally spiraling into really weighing the pros of just doing something very permanent.

I feel like no matter what  I can't just have peace in .y house. Not for a minute. Like  it's always got to go to some stupid fucking extreme before anything relaxes  which  by that point  I'm so beyond upset that I can't eat or sleep or calm down. 

I might wind down about 4  if I'm lucky  and then have to be back up at 6. This has been every night for months.

The ex says she doesn't hit them... But  for real  she largely is mean as a fucking snake to them from time to time(post partum  maybe?)  or shoves them away. She's never been one to be overly loving to the girls  but hell if she doesn't dote on the ones she has with her boyfriend.

Her boyfriend is pretty chill. We get along  but he's not the most motivated individual. He seems unlikely to address things with her to avoid her brand of conflict (it can get down to a lot). I'm almost certain he's pretty good with them  but I have a hard time trusting that.

I'm beginning to wonder if it's just the universe or God or Satan or whatever trying to just push me to the point of ending it.

It's looking more enticing  if I'm honest.

I'm not sure what to do. I don't feel like helplines  doctors  therapists or any of that help. Never have in my experience.

I'm really just thinking maybe it's just time. I'm so tired. I just want quiet. I want to not feel exhausted or stiff in my neck and back  or hungry or unwashed (time to really take a long shower is almost impossible to find  and some days  it's a struggle to get to wash my fucking hair in the sink).

Maybe it's just this way for some people. Maybe it's fates way of setting me up to lose my kids  or jump off a bridge  or just to torture me.

I just want it all to stop  but I don't want to lose my kids because of them just misbehaving  and I don't want them to think daddy opted out. 

There's no other way I see this all working out otherwise  though.

Should I just let the wave overtake me? Let the kids go(the ex doesn't want to take them  never had  so then moving with the ex when they leave wouldn't happen)  and finally just finish it?

i don’t want to be here  i’m only here because i don’t want to ruin the lives of the people who care for me. sometimes i think that i can just continue to live on despite being miserable for the sake of other people’s happiness  but i’m not sure whether i’m going to make it. almost every thought i have eventually loops back to suicide  no matter how happy the initial thought.

If I do not text somebody  we will not talk. 

I remember earlier this year  another student at my school died in a car crash. Over the next couple of weeks  all anyone would talk about was him and mourning him  which was all very sweet. But I know that if I died  at most  everyone would be uncomfortable for a day or two then move on. 

I'm 15 and never had a partner before. Hell  I've never kissed or held hands with someone romantically. Nobody's talking about how they have a crush on me or how they want to be with me.

Even my own father says that I have too much of an attitude and that no man would ever want me. 

I could change  but I feel like it would just be a facade  a mask that I would be wearing because nobody would want to be around the real me. Even if I got a partner  I'd have to wear the mask around them because otherwise they would realize I'm not good enough for them and leave.

SuicideWatch,My death and the acceptance that nobody will truly care for me.,"I have accepted that my rape did in-fact ruin me  the thing that I have wanted consistently since I was a child was to die. Whether that be from my own hands or somebody else’s  I’ve attempted suicide more times than I can count and I wish each time worked.

I realize that some people have their purpose  I cannot die young because I am here to suffer. I am here to suffer until I die of old age  this is why none of my suicide attempts have worked no matter how hard I try. I was raped once and molested several times by family members and others my entire childhood  I was also beaten and verbally abused.

I will never see myself as handsome because of that.

I love this girl very much  but I must accept that this girl will never come back to me. We will never marry.

Ever since I was young I have seen myself as the only human on Earth  everyone else feels robotic and inhumane to me. From the rude people  who are cruel and disgusting to others ; to the annoyingly plain and ordinary Joe. You all just don’t feel real  whenever someone tries to care for me it just doesn’t feel real either and I’m never not disappointed by it. “the Christian God will save you!” I prayed everyday to die as a child  the people who molested me were Christians and Catholics. Where was the Christian / Catholic God when I was being anally raped by my own relative? 

“It gets better!” And then the better things get ripped from me  and then the better things get ruined by my own mental illness and disabilities that I just can’t seem to fix. It doesn’t get better  my entire life I’ve been unhappy or abused. I have given up and I strangely feel at peace with it  even if I cry it’s nice to know now that once I die ; none of this will matter.

Whether I die of old age or by my own hands  this won’t matter. I left zero mark on the world  I just hope that all this suffering I faced was to cover the suffering of somebody else. I just hope that if other lives exist then I am born as a fully functioning man. I just hope I get to be a fiancé in that one too.

I was not made to be loved  I was made to be somebody to be happy with  to think you love ; but never to truly love. I am nothing and I have accepted this.

Everyone will forever seem robotic  inhumane to me and more. I will never get my happy ending  the only happy ending will be when I finally die. That is it. Nobody understands me  not in a edgy teenager kind of way but in a way that I could somehow word what has been wrong with me and what has gone wrong to me since birth to end and everybody will just shrug  “It’ll get better  just hang on!” I’m tired. 

The only girl I’ve ever seen as the opposite isn’t coming back. Nobody is coming to save me. I have lost the energy to continue trying to save myself. 

I’m going to kill myself tonight  after I post this I’ll attempt hanging myself or try to suffocate myself. If anyone of my friends is reading this sense I know that my bud Mimi knows this account ; thank you for being my friend for over six years.

SuicideWatch,Why does nobody care about your life if the reason for suicide is chronic loneliness?,"[So this got posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1ju3tnc/if_i_dont_get_a_girlfriend_soon_i_will_kill_myself/) a few hours ago  and the response was frankly shameful. So many of us struggle with self esteem issues  loneliness  constant rejection  a host of significant sources of stress  misery  depression  eventually leading to suicide. So why is it ok to just brush it under the rug as though it isn't a problem?

I can't speak for that poster  but for myself all I ever wanted was a chance to be accepted and understood by someone that cared about me. I think about that experience I'll never have  how I'll always be an outcast no matter where I am or what I'm doing  and that I'll never know what it's like to be truly loved by someone. I consider a lifetime of misery from never being able to change this  and I consider it would save a lot of misery for myself and anyone who has the misfortune of coming into contact with me to just end myself

Does that mean my life is worthless? That by wanting to end it because of that it isn't worth even an iota of actual compassion for what I've lived through  day after day  year after year?

I mean if it's called suicide watch because it's there to watch people do it then I guess that would make sense. But otherwise it's pretty messed up to just deem some things that cause significant mental health issues to not be worth anybodies time.",8,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1judy4h/why_does_nobody_care_about_your_life_if_the/

SuicideWatch,I’m getting brain surgery next month and nobody in my life fucking cares,I don’t try to compare to others because I know I have had much more opportunity for growth with severe epilepsy and severe childhood abuse  but I am honestly a little dumbfounded at the lack of even online engagement from people I considered at the very least acquaintances. People are really happy to have me sit inside until the surgery and quietly go through it. It has changed my perspective on life inherently. I used to believe in goodness no matter what  but I do really think now that I have to focus on my own needs. People I have done really difficult things for  fought for  stuck up for  included  not interested. A tiny tiny tiny part of me wants to die in surgery to teach a lesson  but I wouldn’t get to to see it. I haven’t spoken to my parents in weeks. It’s almost surreal in a science fiction kind of way.

I felt a bit better afterwards and did it twice more and I could finally breathe. after that happened I sat in silence for a while and felt guilty and I don't know why it happened so fast and I still can't believe that I did it. I can't talk to anyone about it because everyone has there own problems and I don't want to dump all of my heavy thoughts and feelings on to them it's so hard to ask for help in my family so I just suffer in silence.

I’m hopeless. I hate myself
everything i fucking touch  I ruin. 
I used to be so smart and have a hope and a plan for life. Now I’m fucked  probably going to be broke  alone  drug addict  and pregnant. What happened to me? Why can’t i just live life like the other girls. why can’t I be a normal  for my family? 
part of me feels like my situation is not even really THAT bad. 
I feel like I just make all the wrong choices and i look back and realize how stupid and pathetic i was and am disgusted with myself. and I feel like a burden it doesn’t help that my family often makes me feel like one and convinces me that my problems and I are inconvenient for everybody. im a lonely only child. overlooked  but also smothered. i have barely any friends and i try to keep them but i cant maintain a friendship to save my life because im too awkward  distant  morbid  weird  or clingy. I’m usually pretty good with social cues  but I’m starting to think that that’s not true. People that have tried to help me are pretty damn tired of me because i dig myself into a deeper hole and don’t get better despite their many efforts. what they don’t understand is that this shit runs deep idk that sounds stupid but it does. 
I put myself together every day to look like I’ve got everything together but that’s everything but the truth. I just look at myself in the mirror and think I am so fucking ugly—no matter what I do  I can’t change the fact that I look like my fucking dad and that I’m just a failure that “fell off.” A good girl turned slut. A jesus kid turned to a cynical nihilist. A smart ib child  now failing 3 of her courses. im deep in this and i don’t know how to get out. i have to leave my life behind or kill myself. yea i know it sounds extreme but what can i say  im fucking insane. my brain isn’t wired like everyone else’s. im not normal but my family doesn’t want to accept that in order to save face. They’d Rather not acknowledge my mental issues that are in desperate need of serious gentle help  love  and understanding care. I warned everyone of my downward spiral a few weeks ago. spoke to my parent about it and was met with nonchalant “just wait and see” “absolutely NOT  you’ll be missing instruction time at school” as if i wouldn’t be missing that and more once im dead. absofuckinglutely ridiculous the dismissiveness is. underplaying it is their drug of choice. while my drug of choice is coke. im such a fucking let down but deep down  i believe i deserve better and that part of me makes me less inclined to stick a trigger in my mouth and blow my stupid fucking brain matter to smithereens. I wish i could run away and start again. Maybe that would fix me. or maybe nothing can fix me  and i’m just genuinely a sad case of a girl from a decent middle class family that “had stuff going for her” (used to before i got touched and religious trauma of being gay fucked everything up) that killed herself despite asking for help multiple times and being told she was just “lazy”. also if i do attempt to kill myself and fail- i will be more screwed because i will lose my job which means losing my autonomy and I will be held in the dirty ass ward for a long time since failed suicide attempts are not my first rodeo.

yea that felt great to get off my chest
sorry for grammatical errors i gave up halfway through sometimes and started using speech to text. 
i just want to feel heard  unconditionally loved with GENTLENESS  and successful. 
I want to feel pretty and smart again  not like the stupidest and most unstable person in the room.
if i can’t have that what the hell is the point. I see other people with that and I have been through so much shit. I FUCKING DESERVE IT. 
and fuck school. fuck my fuck ass grades. THATS ALLLLL EVERYONE SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT NOWADAYS. “HOW IM GETTING MY SCHOOLWORK DONE. WHAT NEW ASSIGNMENTS I’VE TURNED IN. WHAT I GOT ON THE BIG TEST.” WELLL SHIT FUCK . yea!
goodthinking  a manic suicidal teenager will do great with that. ‘insane depressive adhd bitch’ 
 the perfect recipe for success. Of course i will be able to get my work done! its not like i’m contemplating how much better off everyone else would be if I was dead- 90% of the time!

SuicideWatch,I want to disappear for good,"It’s not like I can go to anyone at all. Everything has been so messed up the last 3 years. My therapist has called it a period of transition. But it feels like it’ll never end.

It’s only been about 3 weeks into the new year  and I’m hating every bit of it. My ex-boyfriend broke up with me on the 2nd. He was truly a narcissist and I feel so used. 

Then my parents and I have to move out in a couple weeks because we can’t afford the rent. I may have to give up my cat in the move. 

My job is ok  but it’s taking so much energy out of me because the commute is almost an hour each way. 

My mom wants to quit dialysis and pass away because the treatment plus her chronic back pain is too much during the process. 

My dad has a bigger temper from all the stress he’s under. He’s lost 20-30lbs from it alone. He blows up at me and my mom more times in the last year than he ever has my whole life.

My older brother is off living a good life and hardly comes home because he has a high paying job  beautiful girlfriend  good health  travels  has his dog  etc. 

And I have so many medical problems (fibromyalgia  a disability  etc.)  no friends  and just am so depressed by all of it. I’m done. I can’t do this anymore. I just can’t.

SuicideWatch,I wish I was never been born. I can’t live in reality thinking about everything in the world even smallest details that hurt me. I’m tired of reality.,"I’m always thinking about everything  even smallest details of everything. I can’t play games anymore  listen to music  watch anything or do anything basically because everything hurts me now. I’m overthinking and I have OCD so I have the same anxious thoughts in my head and they never seem to end. I always wanted to be just like everyone else  i’m so jealous of seeing other people playing games  watching films and listening to music  it is just basic life  everyone does that except for me  because I just can’t. Everything in this world makes me uncomfortable and anxious. I want to start finally doing something but then I remember that there is so much things in the world  there is so much stuff lost with time and not existing anymore  and so much stuff not existing yet  these small details about whole world  these facts  all this shit is killing me. I just can’t take the fact that time and reality exist  that i’m not in the void and i’m thinking too much. I can’t play games because every time I try to even think about them my head gets flushed with thoughts like:
- there is a lot of games except for this in the world  I can’t play all of them
- there is so much stuff been in this game and was removed and never come backs
- there is so much different emotions  situations happened to someone else in the world and I wasn’t there because I wasn’t that exact person in that exact time 

All these thoughts hurt me and I want to die  just to not exist and get into void  because there will be NOTHING  nothing to worry about  no thoughts  no emotions  no feelings  nothing to lose and nothing to be afraid of  nothing to accept that you can’t avoid accepting while you in reality. I’m so tired of this  I wish I was just like everyone else. I’m always hearing from other people that they played a new game  found a new band  watched a new film and i’m just different  I can’t do anything that everyone in this fucking world except me are doing. I wish I could just accept this shit and live like everyone else. Why do I even care about all these small facts  why do I keep thinking about reality and time  why is everything going that way? How people around me play games without any hesitation? Why do they just play  get fun of it and don’t care about all these facts I care about?

I’m always thinking about these small things in the world and it is killing me. I’m not really sure that i’m afraid of losing something  i’m not sure that I really care about stuff being removed and evaporating from the world complete as time passes  i’m not sure if I care if I wasn’t someone random in the random timeline doing something  but the fact of these facts existence kills me. I just can’t accept reality as it is. I don’t know what to do. Let me give some more examples so you could understand what I mean:

- lets say there is person A  he is hanging out with his friends  they are doing something and i’m person B. Person A lives in completely different country and time from person B  they are completely different people and don’t even know about each other existence  they are also having different ages  but person B (me) thinks about someone just theoretically existing in the world and the fact that this person exists  that this person was hanging out with his friends in a completely different country  in completely different time and maybe this person even dead by now  just all these facts showing existence  showing reality and time  person B understands that he is NOT person A  he wasn’t in this time  he has different emotions and thoughts  he doesn’t have same memories  he doesn’t have same knowledge in his head  he is completely different person  he wasn’t ever with these people with who person A was in that exact time and they don’t know about each other existence at all  but the FACT of all these things terrifies person B. Thats describes how I always feel. I just can’t live in this reality  I want to be dead because I believe there will be nothingness after death  so there would be no reality and no time too  nothing to terrify me.

SuicideWatch,Everything hurts and I’m tired  just a rant,"I’m falling apart inside and out and fixing any part of it is too much for me. I’m so tired of waking up disappointed I didn’t die in my sleep. I’m tired of everything around me being dirty and not having the energy to clean it. I don’t want to keep getting up and having to look at myself in the mirror again. I’ve lost over half my body weight but I still feel and look too fat even though my ribs are starting to show. I’m tired of constantly being hungry and hating myself after everything I eat. 

I have no real goals and I don’t want to keep living  I know it’ll ruin my mother’s life if I die though since I’m her favorite person. Her birthday is coming up though and I always make her a big cookie  who’s gonna make her a cookie if I’m not there? I’m only living for her at this point  I kinda keep hoping she dies soon too so I won’t have to feel guilty about dying myself.

The only thing I’ve really ever been interested in is falling in love with someone and getting married someday but I’m not really relationship material and I can’t ask a partner to compensate for all my shortcomings. I’m physically unappealing  mentally fucked  and I can’t work. I can’t offer anything in a real relationship so I’ve only had shitty online interactions with people who just want nudes.

SuicideWatch,What to do when everything looks good on paper and afraid to hurt loved ones? ,I think I just need to get this out of my head. Maybe then I’ll stop thinking so much about it. I attempted suicide and lived last year in May. I’ve been trying to “get better” but both my psychiatrist and therapist quit seeing me so I’ve been unmedicated and with very little support. I’ve kind of been figuring out how to exist again on my own. I met my girlfriend in August and I am completely in love with her. She is everything I ever wanted in a partner and more. I’m moving to a bigger city close to her next week (we met while I was looking to move there anyway) and I start a new job utilizing the degree I’ve been working towards. On paper  everything is great. So why do I still want to die? My girlfriend knew about the past attempt and we both have a morbid sense of humor. I once joked when I was thirsty to “just let me shrivel up and die” and my girlfriend told me I wasn’t allowed to leave her in a pretty serious tone. She makes similar jokes about herself and this isn’t the first time I’ve made these jokes  so it took me by surprise. I asked her if that’s what it would feel like  me leaving her  and she started crying and said yes. She said she would be so angry with me and that I would have failed her if I commit suicide. The idea of losing me like that sent her into a bit of a spiral. I’m not even close to better. I’m still consumed most days with wanting to die. I just feel guilty for letting someone fall in love with me and like I should have stopped it. When I attempted last May  during intake in an IOP program I was in  a therapist said that everything looks good on paper so what’s the deal?… now I ask myself that all of the time. I just feel stuck here now  because I don’t want to hurt someone I love so much. But sometimes the thoughts are consuming and I can’t rationalize my way out of them… I’m just scared now. I don’t want to hurt her like that  but also I’m so tired. ,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1i67zuq/what_to_do_when_everything_looks_good_on_paper/
SuicideWatch,Everything hurts,"I don't know where to begin. I'm not really sure why I'm posting it because I don't really see the point  but maybe I've just become so lonely and it's all so bad that I'm doing it anyway  without a point. I think there are reasons to try to live and I want to encourage other people on here  but it also seems like life is objectively not worth living  despite that.

As I was writing this it turned into a big long life rant  because I just have nobody to talk to about anything and I never have  and I've been through awful things and it's been so much isolation and suffering and evil people that it's almost hard to believe  and it's so stupid to me to even write it out like people are supposed to pat me on the shoulder or be able to help somehow that I said  just forget it. It literally doesn't even matter  it's all just screaming into an empty void to me. I'm so alone. I've started wondering if I even really exist  or if it's everybody else who doesn't. Everybody I meet in life just seems the same. They don't care about me and they don't even seem to care about their own friends because they don't really even care about anything but themselves  like some kind of big mass of hollow  fake people. Nobody wants to be friends  nobody wants to be family  nobody wants a relationship  nobody even really wants to just hang out. Idk  I see other people hanging out together with their friends all the time  but it's like I didn't get to have any. Like there weren't enough friends to go around or something and I'm not invited so I'm just alone because that's just how it is. How come everybody I meet is mean? I feel like the punchline of some kind of joke or some sort of universal prank. Where do you all find friends? How did you meet nice people who wanted to be friends?

In a couple weeks it will have been 3 decades of this  and I'm not interested in watching a fourth. Anyway  I feel like my brain and body are starting to shut down. It almost feels dementia-like how I'm struggling to remember things or keep information straight anymore  although it's gotten hard to care about that  either. The inside of my head feels like it's on fire and my chest hurts all the time. I've done so many things to try to take responsibility and take my life into my own hands and change things for the better  and despite putting all my effort in and really not doing too bad at things sometimes  everything just keeps falling through. Despite trying their best  some people just don't get lucky and some people just lose. I don't know what to do or where to go anymore because I don't see a point and it's all bad and it always ends the same  and I'm always alone and it always hurts  and I'm not motivated to do anything just for my own sake anymore because there's just no point  I don't care anymore. I'm just struggling to stay afloat financially and right now it's not working out  again  as always. Again and again and again with the same story and the same bs  I don't even know if it's more devastating or maddening anymore  and I really can't take any more of it. I feel like I'm going to throw up every day and my hands just kind of tremble now and I spend most of my time crying anytime I'm alone. I smoke and I drink and I cut to release the pain when it's all boiling over in my head  and nothing is getting me through anymore.

One of these days I'm going to disappear like a real ghost and I'll be entirely erased from existence  and it'll all be over  and the thought gives me so much relief  and I never know why I keep prolonging it when I should just do the smart thing and end this circus charade.

Or is it already too late as an average looking 28 year old who looks her age (but like a mature looking version of her age)?

I want an age I can give up because that will give me the motivation to at least try until that age. I do think it's already too late though. It seems like women my age who look it  who are average looking and who have the same tastes as me always end up settling. Is it too late? If it's not too late  then when is it too late? It would be nice to have an age to keep trying to. It already feels like it's too late though which makes me hopeless.

SuicideWatch,I killed my dad  and I'm not sure how I'm supposed to live anymore,"A bit of warning before anyone starts commenting on this. I'll likely not be responding a lot as it's taking a lot out of me just to start writing this  but I'll probably be reading most comments. 

A month before my 20th birthday my dad got scammed out of a lot of money on a dating website  it made him extremely pissed off and he attacked me with a knife on his way to get a shotgun. I managed to wrestle him to the ground and get the knife off of him without being stabbed  but I wasn't able to keep him from moving closer to grab the knife again. I ended up using the hose of a tire pump nearby to choke him  but in my panic I didn't think to unwrap it after he was unconscious. I ran away and called the cops and my brother.

  
I stayed outside when the cops got there and I threw up all over the porch when they told me he was dead. I spent the entire night (9-11 hours) in my pajama pants inside the holding area of the police station. When they released me the next morning I no longer had any keys to my house  my phone  any car  nor did my family want to talk to me or help me at all. I ended up having a neighbor help me open up one of the unlocked windows so I could climb in my room and grab a bag of clothes and my laptop which the cops left behind. I have no job  no money  and now I only have my laptop and a duffel bag filled with clothes. My family hates me and the only reason I'm not on the streats is because a good friend took me in. My sister even got a restraining order on me less than 2 days after it all happened. 

  
Without any way to support myself  and the constant nightmares and hillucinations of my dad  I can just barely get the energy to get out of bed. And relying exclusively on my friend for feeding and housing me just makes me feel even more guilty.

  
I just can't see a path forward and I'm hoping that maybe someone here will give me a bit of inspiration or hope that things will get better. Hell  even just finding someone with a similar experience to talk to might be nice  makes me feel fucking evil and insane that I killed my dad.",1401,148,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1i6uhhf/i_killed_my_dad_and_im_not_sure_how_im_supposed/

Usually around people like my family and boyfriend  I'm just quiet and can just hold all my feelings in  but lately i cant even hold my feelings in and I get so overwhelmed I just take it out on them. I feel so guilty and I am such a shitty daughter  girlfriend  and person in general. Even now when my parents yell at me and cuss me out  before id just feel sad  cry to them  and try explaining myself  but now I just yell back and cuss back  and I have *never* cussed out of frustration infront of my family.

I still cheat on 90% of my work. I'm still as useless and I'm still failing when I try to do it myself. I get headaches anytime I try focusing and that causes me to stress out more making the headaches worse  and leading to me just procrastinating everything.

I started cutting myself again. I wish I wasn't scared of killing myself or hurting myself more. I know I will never be able to gain the courage to kill myself  so all I can do is just lay here in bed and drown in my thoughts while hoping I don't wake up from my sleeps.

SuicideWatch,My goodbye letter <3,"Hello :) 
I am 24F  from a small country in Europe. I am writing this as I have no one to actually say goodbye to - maybe  just maybe someone will notice this so i can get a farewell. And if anyone is interested  I will talk a bit about myself  because all I wanted was for someone to care..

I want no one to be sad for me  I am going content knowing I actually gave life a shot and tried my best! But I know this is the best solution :( Life is not meant for everyone and that is okay. 

Ever since I was little I had no other purpose than to be mercilessly abused by my teachers and peers and neglected by my parents (I believe they did not mean to  so I have no hard feelings though). 
I was treated as if I was less than human. If something in the class broke  they all agreed to blame it on me. If someone didn’t wipe the board that day  they’d say I was on duty so I’d be the one punished. They’d also beat me with a chair  push me down the stairs  throw my pencils out the window  step on my clothes so they’d be dirty  throw food in my face… you get the idea. At some point kids said if you touched me  you’d get a virus that made you as stupid and ugly as I was so no one wanted to sit next to me. I get really sad when I see younger pictures of myself :( She was a sweet girl and she didnt deserve that. Every day was like walking on the battlefield  I would pray to God to take me away but he didn’t want to. I was 11 at most :( My only relief was art  anime  video games and such. Up until 15 I only had online friends on an internet forum back then  and they helped me with loneliness. 

High school was a bit better but I ended up really depressed and spent it battling an eating disorder and not living my years unlike my peers :( My parents didnt notice I was struggling even though I was losing so much weight  they were too attentive to my little brother that had some issues so he needed more help and attention which I understood. But I was left to battle everything alone with no support :( I developed depression  SH issues and an ED. I went to therapy but didn’t help much :( 

Right now i’m working with kids  they are cute and I love them but my workplace is really abusive and it brought me to a new low :( it’s well paid but that doesn’t help me much. I dread everyday just like I did when I was a kid. I am just living the same sh’t again and again and cannot change anything. I know if I keep on living it will just be more and more abuse as this is why i was born :( i don’t know anything else but this. 

Love of my life left me a while ago and he is much better without me. Im too broken to love and be loved. (D  if u ever read this know that I loved u from the bottom of my heart. I am sorry I was not a better gf for you.)

Sadly I cannot feel anything anymore but despair and hopelessness. I left behind all my dreams of being an artist or a sports teacher or a trainer (i really love working out) sadly I chose psychology to study and I cannot change it anymore nor study something else :( I don’t even have the energy left anymore anyway. 

I really hope my parents will take care of my cats  two strays I saved and raised from since they were the size of my palm. Maxine and Sissi  you kept me alive for a little more and you are the light of my life 🤍 I will remember your shiny  emerald eyes  your soft fur  and you purring on my chest as I pass away. 

I had so much love to give sadly I didn’t know how to give and receive   and I am also really scared of people deep down :( I dont know how to fit in and never knew. I tried to change my life inside and outside  I really tried it all. But now my soul is really worn out :( 
I would like to thank everyone who kept me alive for a little longer  anyone who ever tried even in the slightest to encourage me  and saw even the littlest potential in me. 
I am sorry I bit like a scared dog the hands of people who tried to help because I couldn’t distinguish anymore who was and who wasn’t well-meaning. I am so sorry :( I have many regrets in this life too  all them being I wasn’t a better person to the very little people who loved me. In my last moments  I hope they can forgive me and visit my grave or think about me from time to time. I am sending everyone so much love and gratitude  it was a difficult journey and a really painful one too. I think my soul has learned a lot in this painful lifetime. But it is enough. 

Mom  Dad  I love you. I forgive you for not being there for me. I hope you can forgive me too. My dear cats  I love you. My beloved ex bf  I forgive you for leaving and i’ll always love you. The friends I had and left  i’ll cherish the memories. And everyone who took their time to read until the end  thank you! Goodbye everyone!

SuicideWatch,Please help me. This is urgent  I need advice quickly. I am going to lose him.,"I'm shaking while typing this. My friend  who has previously been very open about being suicidal and has been worsening throughout the past couple months  stating he'd commit suicide within the year  joined a voice chat I was having with another friend  and said that he almost died without elaborating. Then  a couple minutes later  he started randomly repeating an exact date  time and location. February 3rd  10pm  along with a location I will not say. I tried finding this on Google maps to see how close it was to his house. After a bit  he sent me and my friend a link to Google maps street view. It was the location he stated  a view of being on a bridge with train tracks beneath it. The hint was obvious. On Saturday  my friend is going to try to kill himself. Please  reddit  what should I do?

Edit: I have spoken to my parents and will speak to a school Councillor tomorrow  and take it from there. If I don't update this  I either forgot to edit or didn't manage to save him.

Edit 2: Thanks for the advice  I know what to do already. You don't need to leave any more comments.

Edit 3: Im making this edit to tell you guys you don't need to be concerned for him and that he'll be fine. His mother is aware  not his father for personal reasons to him. His mum is keeping an eye on him and now he has no possible way to get there since it's far away. Thank you guys  I think you've all helped save a life.

Edit 4: February 3rd  11:03 and he's still alive and at home. He's safe. I did it. Thank you guys so much. I love every single one of you who helped me and him. From the bottom of my heart  thank you all.

Hey guys. Writing this the day after. He attempted suicide. He did this around midnight last night. He sent a message and ten minutes later I saw it and quickly got my parents to call his mum. I think that was the only reason his mother was able to wake up in time and stop him. If I hadn't checked my phone last night because I was bored  I probably would have lost my best friend. To anyone who commented saying that he was just doing it for attention: Fuck you.

I feel so lonely inside no matter how many people there are and im paranoid. I dont love doing anything and i dont look forward to my future.

Long story short  i recently got into a fight with some of my closest friends because despite doing anything i could told cheer them up they told me that my bad mood was ‘’weighting onto them’’ and i was a ‘’bad friend’’ because i dont know how to communicate well and i cant really comfort people well and last time i tried to comfort one of them they didnt appreciate it  and when i tried to explain myself and started raising my voice cuz they repeated the same things over and over  they told me i was ‘’playing the victim’’. I told them to go fuck themselves and went back to my dorm crying. They tried to call me and send me dms and i told them i would only come back if they apologized but they dont want to. They even implied my ex was right for ghosting me and leaving me.

Im tired of everything. I feel like i cant trust anyone and im only losing more than i gain. I am alone inside and i hate everything  i hate being here and i hate my life.

SuicideWatch,I hate my life.,"Everything went fine until Friday last week. First of all  I have Anorexia and I'm still in school. 15f. My teacher walked up to me and said that she's worried  and asked me to go to the school nurse on Tuesday (that was today). I  of course said hell no. And today my teachers walked up to me and wanted to talk. I said no yet again because I was scared of the nurse. I hate that woman more than myself. So on Friday I had a panic attack that lasted 3 whole hours just because of that. I was scared of getting hospitalized  I know for myself I'm dangerously underweight. I already gained a kilo and I'm making progress. I'm getting better. I'm literally crying while writing this because I'm desperate. Here at home I can eat what I want  I have control over my life  I just need some space but my teacher is making it worse. She's trying to help but she hurts me. I hate her. She could ruin my life with just one phone call. I would rather die than getting sectioned. I'd rather drown or hang myself. I can't stand the thought of getting forced to eat what they give me. I don't care how many people recovered there. I want to recover on my own and if they don't let me fuck them. My suicidal thoughts have become less  but since Friday suicide is in my head none stop. I don't want their help  nor do I need it. Yes I'm ill  so what? This world is so damn fucked. Getting hospitalized for fucking with your OWN life is MESSED UP in my opinion. I'm not a threat to anyone else. ""permanent solution to temporary problems"" MY ASS. FUCK TEACHERS FUCK DOCTORS I HATE THEM!!",18,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1g4dyh6/i_hate_my_life/

SuicideWatch,I’m trans  I hate my life. I wanna die.,My name is Yuki. I am a 23-year-old girl who unfortunately is transgender. All of my life I've been very sad and very depressed. I don't know how much more I can take  I really want to die  this life sucks and I hate my body. I have always felt this way  but I have always been harassed  bullied  abused  and neglected for who I am. I have been hurt physically. I have been hurt mentally. I have been raped. I don't know how much more of this I can take.  Three weeks ago I tried to kill myself and I ended up in a psych ward for a week. I kind of want to try again. I hate this life. I don't know what to do. It's not a matter of people excepting me for me  it's a matter of me  wishing I was born in a female body instead of being a transgender woman.  I am super sad all the time. I wish I could go back in time and have my parents understand me sooner rather than neglecting me and telling me my feelings were fake and just don't phase. Overall  I don't know what to do  I'm super sad every day I feel like garbage I'm super suicidal and find no enjoyment in anything anymore.  I want to die and step into the unknown and see if in the nothingness after death if there is another life or not. Anyway  I just wanted to post this on here just to see if anyone else feel similar to I and if anyone has any advice or anything  I could try to be happier in this life. ,23,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1g1s5e0/im_trans_i_hate_my_life_i_wanna_die/

SuicideWatch,considering practicing attempting again until I'm numb to pain and will be able to do it one day  these breakdowns and anxiety attacks are getting even worse.,"**I can't handle it anymore.** This is my fault  everything  the blame goes to nobody else. I wish I didn't have any boundaries towards my families  and wish I could be the perfect human being  to everyone. This life is worthless  I see no meaning  and the panic  the anxiety  the depression  it doesn't get better. so  I will start to practice suicide methods. I will give myself 6 months to  a year to find a real reason to live  but until then  I will be practicing small methods until I am no longer scared of pain  and when I am ready to go  I will go. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a bit excited about the idea. I can't just wait until I graduate college  I don't even know if I could last another year. I would not go without saying goodbye to those I love  if I disappeared without warning it would be too cruel. I can't eat without wanting to throw up  my chest hurts. Everyday I sacrifice sleep to be alone in my room (i get 2-3 or none at all)  since I am never alone otherwise. And never being alone makes me feel odd  I just wanted some alone time... But I found out that my mother had been standing out in front of my room listening in on me. Now I can't sleep or do anything  scared that someone  somewhere is watching... My own home doesn't feel like home anymore. I hear yelling everyday  and don't go outside the house for more than a week  because I have to take care of my grandmother at home.  And bad things just keep happening  too many things I cannot list  and then the panic gets worse. It hurts  it hurts it hurts it hurts  I want to throw up my organs and die. my own mother even asked me ""Who are you?"" when she saw how unhinged I acted alone. It broke my heart.



 I fake my happiness everyday  and I feel so guilty because everyone seems to fall for it  when I falter they are angry and look at me with something I cannot describe  I kept panicking and the tears wouldn't stop  now I'm labeled as a sensitive person  crying over nothing. And I study for HOURS  a day  amazing grades  amazing participation  amazing everything. But not an amazing person. My boundaries are stupid. I don't like physical touch and I was scared to communicate so  but I worked up the effort and I said it out loud. Everyone thinks I'm weird  different  and ungrateful. The only time I'm not anxious is when I'm with my friends. but my family sees that. They think I don't love them  and they yell saying they're not bad family members  that I'm looking at them in a bad light and don't respect them. If i didn't respect them  I wouldn't be faking all this for them  but I cant just tell them that...

 I have nobody to confide in. No real reasons to live. I am only living for those who expect me to  and that I can't bear to write goodbye to those I still love. There's so many more reasons to kill myself that would make this too long. But I  will still  in secret  research ways to die  and practice everyday  every single day until I get it right..........",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1edsczk/considering_practicing_attempting_again_until_im/

SuicideWatch,anxiety attack,I often believe there's something so fundamentally wrong with me. I don't want to mention specifics. Could be an OCD situation  intrusive thoughts and so on. I hope it is. I'm trying to get it looked into. But it feels so real sometimes  like it's just an objective truth that i'm just  incurably horrible. I know my brain can lie to me but the knowledge doesn't make it any less real. Maybe it is actually just the truth. It's very hard to tell my rational and irrational worries apart anymore. When something really triggers these worries  i feel like the only option is to just die. I would never think that way of anyone else by the way  i guess i just can't imagine working on myself enough to fix something so horrible. Even if it turns out i'm not like  some morally corrupt monster  it feels like my brain is so jumbled from thinking about this for so long that it's impossible to sort out anymore. I know things tend to get better but in these moments it feels hopeless. I know i won't actually do it but the thought of downing all my meds and seeing if it knocks me out so i don't have to deal with this is very tempting.,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1aojlzq/anxiety_attack/

SuicideWatch,I killed my dad  and I'm not sure how I'm supposed to live anymore,"A bit of warning before anyone starts commenting on this. I'll likely not be responding a lot as it's taking a lot out of me just to start writing this  but I'll probably be reading most comments. 

A month before my 20th birthday my dad got scammed out of a lot of money on a dating website  it made him extremely pissed off and he attacked me with a knife on his way to get a shotgun. I managed to wrestle him to the ground and get the knife off of him without being stabbed  but I wasn't able to keep him from moving closer to grab the knife again. I ended up using the hose of a tire pump nearby to choke him  but in my panic I didn't think to unwrap it after he was unconscious. I ran away and called the cops and my brother.

  
I stayed outside when the cops got there and I threw up all over the porch when they told me he was dead. I spent the entire night (9-11 hours) in my pajama pants inside the holding area of the police station. When they released me the next morning I no longer had any keys to my house  my phone  any car  nor did my family want to talk to me or help me at all. I ended up having a neighbor help me open up one of the unlocked windows so I could climb in my room and grab a bag of clothes and my laptop which the cops left behind. I have no job  no money  and now I only have my laptop and a duffel bag filled with clothes. My family hates me and the only reason I'm not on the streats is because a good friend took me in. My sister even got a restraining order on me less than 2 days after it all happened. 

  
Without any way to support myself  and the constant nightmares and hillucinations of my dad  I can just barely get the energy to get out of bed. And relying exclusively on my friend for feeding and housing me just makes me feel even more guilty.

  
I just can't see a path forward and I'm hoping that maybe someone here will give me a bit of inspiration or hope that things will get better. Hell  even just finding someone with a similar experience to talk to might be nice  makes me feel fucking evil and insane that I killed my dad.",1405,148,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1i6uhhf/i_killed_my_dad_and_im_not_sure_how_im_supposed/

SuicideWatch,I just want the pain to stop,"I tried my hardest and it is never good enough. 

Getting divorced. I don't have time to financially recover to take over our little house. We didn't want children but we wanted pets. I have a dog and lots of cats. We loved them but after my husband found a new girlfriend  he abandoned them with me. This isn't a big deal to me  I am their momma and they belong with me. Pets are family and family is for life. 

But he's been financially abusing me for 8 years - I am not in a position to qualify for most rentals  let alone one that will accept all my pets. I have no friends or family that could help. I have nothing. There's no where to bring them where I could keep them safe. I don't even have a car to move them out of the house. 

The plan is to just give up. They are going to end up in a shelter either way and I'd rather not live through that pain. I don't want to live a day without them with me. I will schedule an email to my ex  letting him know that he won and then I'm jumping off a bridge. Maybe hanging. I don't know yet. Whatever is easier in the moment.

My spirit guides and spirits giving way and letting me reincarnate as a cis girl early without this ""lesson learning"" ""you need to enjoy this life"" ""you need to leave something behind"" this utter indescribable AGONY of the cosmic HORROR  the cosmic MISMATCH but the solution that is so easily right there  the easiest absolute complete solution is withheld by earthy and divine authorities. I can't function  I'm on my spring break and I can't even relax. I am in unbearable amounts of pain and asking for further help is just going to me be being physically restrained. I need a doctor  a therapist that can give me REAL TANGIBLE RELIEF. Every doctor I go to  every therapist  every specialist is always left scratching their heads  a new prescription being written  or some gaslighting talk therapy to modify behaviors which are the correct response to this complete cosmic injustice I fave every single day. I should be a happy cis girl out with her friends on spring break  in a bikini with happy normal neurotypical girly thoughts in my head instead I am a eunuch castrated autistic man moping in my car a crying dysfunctional mess looking outside at a sunny day with everyone else living a life with me being granted a life no matter how hard I scream at my spiritual guides  no matter how much I lament  no matter how many tears I spill they still pump blood to my heart  they still make my body wake the next day after each night's sleep and withhold the solution to my problem  wanting to be a neurotypical cis girl. I am sobbing crying mess in my car in a life I am crying begging almighty God to release me from. I can't bear the agony anymore. If I can't be female this then I don't want to live ",5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1j8tksu/i_want_the_pain_to_end_mtf_trans/
SuicideWatch,Everything suddenly became worthless and nothing makes sense. I don't know why I feel the way I do. Being in temporary states of extreme pain and mental and physical paralysation. And yet  I still want to live. Help me keep being alive,"**Edited for correction of grammar and spelling mistakes.**

Do not ONLY tell me ""you were wronged/oppressed/treated badly"". I didn't come for validation. I don't want to enter an echo chamber where I hear ONLY what I want. Be constructive and point out were I did something wrong or where I was unclear/need to elaborate

**(1)** I recently lost the will to live. I questioned everything I know until I stripped everything off of its value. Basically this: ""Don't get attached to something so you don't get depressed when you lose it"". It removed the need for attachment in life. No one said this to me  I came to this conclusion

**(2)** This lead me to questioning my purpose and existence as a human being. I also don't remember having anything I strived for or was genuinely passionate about. I only remember that I never did something for myself

**(3)** Father's lack of presence is probably the root of this  or at least one major reason. He lived with my family and I until last year and I can't remember anything good from him. Even bad things from him  I barely remember them. My mother keeps telling me that he did terrible things behind our backs and in front of our eyes and yet I barely remember them

I can't remember anything from when I was 8 until now (17 years old). The hole in my memory and forgetfulness is taking a toll on me. It makes me sad

**(4)** I now suffer from randomly occurring long episodes of extreme and unexplained sadness  sobbing  and silently screaming. These last 5 hours each. 2 hours in this extreme state of emotion; physically and emotionally paralysed unable to think about anything else; unable to get up; and in excruciating pain. 3 hours cooling off and being physically tired and emotionally numb

When I am not in this state  I look normal until I get presented with work. For instance  I can solve 1 or 2 H.W questions before inexplicable feeling of discomfort that kicks in and keeps increasing until it devolves into said state of extreme emotion  paralysation  and pain. I think having to force myself using willpower to do everything is the problem here. Remember not doing something for myself in **(2)**?

Every time I get into this state  I feel an overwhelming need to kill myself. The pain during that is unreal. The thought of doing that scares me  adding more pain.

Mother thinks I am over-reacting and that I don't want to do my responsibilities and I am over here questioning why I should even move to eat. I mean that in the most literal sense with no exaggeration

Having nothing to strive and care for \[see **(1)** and (**2)**\]  my problem with father \[see **(3)**\]  and meaningless suffering \[see **(4)**\] lead to not having a will to live and wanting to end the suffering.

I got into contact with a doctor? a specialist? basically someone who can help by talking things out. They helped and I felt a little better. Mother isn't a horrible person  but becomes one when it's anything academic related. I seriously hope this isn't Stockholm syndrome. Last session with the doctor  they told mother to stop being so hard on me. This made life so much easier despite me not doing much studying for exactly 2 days. I usually lose my mind when there is unfinished work. I felt as if I could breath and enjoy life again during these 2 days. Then she returned to treating me as usual

**(5)** These 2 day also taught me something very important: I am not mentally ill and I don't have any physical disabilities. I wasn't like this before. I think I only need someone to help encourage me and push me forward. Every time I imagine someone in my head supporting me and crying: ""You can do this!"" and ""You can get out of this!"" things get a lil better. I don't want to **ONLY** relying on my imagination too much because I fear I might actually hallucinate later on like this

Last time I was in this state of extreme pain and emotion  something changed. ""I no longer want to die. I want to live for however many years I have left + 100 more! If this is what I am fighting for then it must be well worth the suffering!"". This is exactly what I said to myself during that

I don't why this happened and I won't question it \[see **(1)**\]. I want it be this way until my heart stops beating. I know getting out of this is well within my capabilities. I just need emotional support \[see **(5)**\]. Also how do I continue my everyday life without this horrible state stopping me completely dead in my tracks  or  even better yet  how to do deal with such things? I will eventually have to deal with other worse things so I need to be well equipped",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1io9sap/everything_suddenly_became_worthless_and_nothing/
SuicideWatch,I can't with the pain of kms but I don't want to keep living this lonely and depressed,"Sorry for any typo or mistake  English is not my native language.

I'm a fucking teenager dude  there's so much things that I want to do and so much i want to see but I don't know if I'm going to last that long.

I've actually made a list of things I wanna do before dieing  like seeing the release of games like Silksong or USR  making a YouTube channel  learning to draw better or play the piano with both hands...

I've wanted to kill myself years ago  but I've never done it because of how painful it would be  I'm a fucking coward that can't handle pain at all  so I've never been able to do anything in order to kms  I sometimes wish there was a big red button that kills me upon mere contact  as a matter of fact  I'll probably wouldn't be posting this rn if that shit existed 

Also my depression comes from the fact that I don't go to school  therefore I don't have any friends/someone to talk to... The only person I have is my cousin that has went through something similar  but I'm too embarrassed to talk about this with her And my parents aren't really the best listeners in the world so :/

It makes me wanna cry seeing my mom worrying about how I spent to much time in my room with my phone  I can't tell her any of this or else I'll probably ended up without screens for the rest of my life. She is a beautiful person and I love her very much  she also had suicidal thoughts before having me but she said that when I was born she got a reason to not kill herself  she also has said that she would kill herself if I ever die before her  and we are always playing with this topic but she sounds very serious about that tho... 

I don't want to take her life but I can't handle being this lonely and depressed  I'll definitely not kill myself soon but I've wanted to share my fellings here cause it's the only place I know where my mom won't find them

And i want to say  that my situation is probably MILES away from what the people in this subreddit are going through  I just feel like sharing it to you guys...

If you have any tips of how to deal with this  please comment them  I'll happily read them :) cause I'm not leaving reddit anytime soon  it's the place where I can say my problems to a void of anonymously and get an answer back",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1j1iqi7/i_cant_with_the_pain_of_kms_but_i_dont_want_to/

SuicideWatch,nobody understands and no one is there to help me. everyone lied and apparently i just deserve to die,"tried to reach out and received responses analogue to telling a blind person to appreciate colours. so have deep trauma that lasts decades with your parents and the only thing you want to do is to cut tie with them? im sure having an open conversation with them will solve the problem. whats the worse thing that could happen? ranted about my situation and all i got was being bashed on self diagnosing my conditions (i waited for years  psychiatrists just refused to treat or assess me. did extensive research  and people around me who are professional or diagnosed agree). saying its harmful to the ones that actually suffer from the conditions  yet what the fuck do you know about me? its so easy to type on a keyboard judging people youve never met isnt it?
im sorry i shouldnt ever reach out  i should just die. i deserve it. 

my favourite person (bpd related) told me he cares about me yet its been months and he never texts me asking how im doing. he wasnt even reading the texts from me seriously and treated me like his personal agenda - popping up every week or so telling me his plans so “oops sorry cant see you tomorrow” and thats it. NOT A SINGLE TEXT. im forgotten so easily and nobody  absolutely nobody can help me when im in a crisis like this! said he cares but he fucking doesnt  if you care why dont you send me a text asking me how i have been? this would do so much and you know that  but youre just a fucking liar!
i thought i could continue the relationship with my fp after all but the reality is im forgotten so quickly in like  two months. 
why does moving on feel so cold and cruel?

the psychiatrists refuse to treat me  i have plans to kill myself  i have constant impulsive thoughts to just stab a random stranger on street  even some plans to murder my own family members. brought them up to the psychiatrists and apparently they thought its okay and its normal to feel jealous of others life etc. stopped going there a few days ago because its so fucking triggering. they insisted not treating me unless my family is involved (im an adult)  and i broke down. losing my voice asking  so i just deserve to die? so i should just be left alone because i want to heal myself at first? so what? you guys are supposed to help suicidal people arent you? you only make me want to kill myself more. 

apparently im not ill enough to be treated properly. so i will get worse. planning to do an attempt next week… :) i dont care whether i will be dead or not. i just want to feel validated. according to my psychiatrists’ actions i deserve that either way.

SuicideWatch,I’m sorry  but I’m going to do it. My cat must know  he is on my lap. At midnight I will do it. Please help me. Any body. I’m honestly done. I don’t care if I’m 13. I just want it to end,"I haven’t told anybody how I’m feeling because I don’t want to go to the mental hospital. The mental hospital is hell. If it wasn’t there I would be talking to my parents. I would be getting help. But I can’t  I know the consequences. The hospital punishes me. I would use a hotline but I don’t want police coming to my house. I’m scared. I’m the most scared I’ve been in my life. 





I know nobody will read this  but here I want to tell my story. The truth is  I want to live. I just want the pain to stop. 




I’m a 13 year old girl. I’ve been hospitalized 4 times. I’ve been suffering a lot. I have no self-confidence. I have no love for myself. 
I sew. I sew dolls. I love my dolls. Nobody will understand. 



Here is my first goodbye.  To my dolls: I love you. I know when I leave you will go to. I’m sorry. My heart breaks. I wish I could’ve taken care of you better. You saved my life 2 times. You helped me when I needed it the most. I will say all your names. I love all of you. I’m in tears. I don’t want to leave you. I don’t want to go. Kazumi  Sayaka  Kyoko  Mami  Madoka  Luka  Rin  Homura  Yachiyo  Iroha  Sana  Felicia  Tsuruno  Nikki  Ren  Rena  Mitama  Alina  Kanade  Sakura  Rika  Gumi  Emma  Ruby  Weiss  Blake  Yang  Yowane  Nagisa. I’m so sorry. I love you. All of you




To Miku: I love you. Your not even a doll to me. You are my best friend. My very best friend. You where there when no other human friend loved me. You where there when I cried out for help. You are here now sleeping not knowing anything. I can’t even apologize. It won’t mean anything. I hope in another world we could meet again. I love you.




I draw. Everyday. But nobody likes my drawings.  Here is my second goodbye: to my materials. I wish I could’ve used you more. I wish I could’ve made something worth while out of you. But I couldn’t. Maybe someone else can. I’m sorry.




I used to sing. I lost confidence in doing so. Here is my third goodbye: to my unwritten words. I’m sorry I couldn’t sing you to the world. I’m so sorry.




My fourth: To mommy and daddy and my brother. I love you. I wish I could’ve made you happier. I wish I could’ve made you proud.





And finally Binxy. My cat. You are with me now  in my last hours. I can’t even say anything. You won’t understand. My heart is dust now  because I’m being selfish. You are 14.  I don’t want to make you last years sad. I know you love me. You will miss me. I can’t even say anything. You seem to know. You have your head down. I know I’m being selfish. But please know  I love you. I love you so much Binxy. 




I don’t know what to do. I want help. But I can’t with out going to the hospital. I’m sorry. Please forgive me. Hold my hand. Give me a hug. Anything. With one final cry  please. I don’t want to go. But I can’t stay. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.  I’m sorry.",1515,200,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/eo9o49/im_sorry_but_im_going_to_do_it_my_cat_must_know/

SuicideWatch,My head is so fucked up and nobody understands   not even me.,Hello I’m 16  I’ve tried everything to help myself you can think of and I’m really contemplating suicide again as I feel inferior to everyone. I’m not whining or crying out for help (I am male so suppress my feelings most of the time). But anyway yeah  I’m diagnosed with ASD  I’m extremely underweight naturally   can’t get a girlfriend  constantly told I’m weird. I’ve abused nearly every drug as it’s my form of escapism  I quit my shitty £5/hour job I been working since 13 today by just not going in and now idrk  I’m very passionate about music but everyone says I won’t get anywhere.

I want to stop existing.,"I was going to write some long winded post explain how in despair I feel  I erased it all. It's not worth it. I don't care. There's this quote I saw  it was from a 19 year old girl to her mother about how the girl felt about being autistic and having burnout. ""I think this is it  Mum. 19 years is my limit..."" It sums up everything I feel perfectly. I guess 16 years is mine. 

I'm just tired. At my limit. And I can't even get a break from it all  everytime I go seeking one it's shut down. I've shut down too. I'm done with it all  I want to stop existing.

SuicideWatch,My life isn't BAD bad  but I don't see the point to living. It just feels like I'm wasting away. But I don't want to kill myself either. I just want to vanish  or maybe fall into a coma.,"I'm probably going to sound like a terrible ungrateful person for saying this but  I just don't want to deal with anything anymore. My family is okay  had some arguing here and there but nothing abusive. I'm currently in uni with decent grades but also a whole lot of stress.

I've had suicidal thoughts for at least 8 years now  most of the times they come and go  but recently I've been starting to feel like things are pointless. I don't want to end up in a low paying job in this broken economy  doing the same thing from day till night  rinse and repeat. I hate having to deal with expectations of people and myself. I hate feeling like a fucking failure who can't get a job because of volatile emotions. I hate dealing with people who expect everything but pay you sheckels.

I don't see the point of carrying on anymore. Sure  there will be good times  but even during the good times I can't feel anything anymore. All I can feel is just neutral or depressed  and all I can do is pretend to be alright  all smiles  maybe play a fucking idiot to put on the act that all is well and I'm an upbeat cheerful person  or I'll just get into more trouble and even more depression. I feel like nobody I talk to will understand  and the people I've talked to all just say ""I've been through worse and I'm fine""  and I'm sick and tired of hearing that.

I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to fall into a coma  but that won't happen anytime soon. Sometimes I just wish my brain wasn't this volatile and would take a chill pill  but a therapist is out of the option since they're very expensive and because of the whole covid situation.

I don't want to be a burden to anyone anymore. But I don't know what to do.

I don't know. Thank you for reading though. Deep down I still wish that everything will be okay  even though I hate holding on to false hope.

SuicideWatch,i feel like a burden,im just 16 and ive attempted about 3 times. I went to the mental hospital for the first time the first week of December 2024 and I felt so horrible for my parents. I felt horrible because the hospital was almost an hour away from where we lived. It was a good hospital and all and it helped me for maybe two weeks after I got out but now that it’s been two months since then I’ve felt as thought life has no meaning anymore. Every day feels like a cycle and I feel the need to end it again. I don’t want to express how I feel to anyone because I know my parents will be worried and they’ll have to go through all the trouble again. Not only that but my school work will be so behind and I’ll be behind all over again. I just don’t want to put my family through all this again but then again  like everyone says  your mental health comes first  but at this point I’m not sure anymore.,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1isvlyl/i_feel_like_a_burden/
SuicideWatch,Feeling like a burden or that I’m “seeking attention”,"I've been dealing with my fiancée leaving me since last September.  Her telling me she's leaving me randomly one day and then her friends are there packing her stuff up.  Then barely a month later she's dating her male ""best friend"".  So not only do I have to deal with the loss of her leaving  I also have to deal with the feeling of being replaced or discarded for someone else.  

I bought a house for us a year and a half ago and now I'm living back at my parents at the age of 38.. getting ready to put the house on the market because I can't afford living there by myself with the mortgage and bills.

I can't shake the thought that she's just having this great life now while I'm stuck cleaning everything up after her abrupt exit.  She told me that she doesn't even think about me anymore.  We were together for almost 5 years.  

I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts  feeling like I have nothing left to look forward to.. the idea of dating and starting over at almost 40 makes me sick to my stomach.  I've talked to my friends  my family and my doctors about my feelings.  About how easy it would be to just end it and not feel this pain anymore.  

I've been staying in contact with people when things get hard but now I'm starting to feel like it's not working anymore.  I type out a message to send someone and then I immediately think that they're just going to see the message and be like ""oh god not this again"" or that I'm just throwing my issues onto them again and being a burden.  

I can't help but keep talking about the same feelings I have and the same thoughts because I don't know how else to process anything.  I know I'm sounding like a broken record.  But if I can't reach out to anyone then what do I do?  I'm already thinking that it's not fair that I have to stay alive for other people's sake. People close to me just don't want to deal with the emotions of me ending my life but why is it their decision?  Why am I not allowed to make my own decision and end it?  And if I want to do it  I get sent to a mental hospital against my will.  How is that fair?  Why do I have to sit here and suffer through these feelings and emotions? They say suicide is selfish and yeah  I think it is.  But aren't we supposed to be selfish when it comes to our stuff?  Like if I'm with a toxic person and I leave for my own well being  that's selfish.  So how come I'm not allowed to be selfish about my own feelings and put an end to all of this pain?

I wish I knew how to handle these feelings better.. but I can't see a bright future.  I tell myself that I'll get better  that I'll improve myself and work on my flaws.  Get into a better shape  mentally and physically  for the next person.  But I'm almost 40  I feel like I'm already reaching the halfway point of my life and I have nothing to show for it.  Having this fear that the only people I'll meet now are just going to settle for me because of where we are at in our lives.  

All anyone can tell me is the same cliche things.  ""Give it time  things will get better""  ""You'll meet the person you're meant to be with""  ""Everything is still new  you'll feel better as time goes on""

What if things don't get better?  What if I already met that person or maybe they don't exist? What if I'm one of those people who are destined to be alone for the rest of their lives and just die alone?  People can say ""oh that won't happen"" but it does happen to people.  It happens to a lot of people and I might be in that category.  That scares me and I'd much rather kill myself and end it now instead of suffering the rest of my life being alone.  

It's easy for people to say positive things when they're not dealing with this stuff but it feels impossible to stay positive for myself.  

I guess that's why I'm here.  Hoping that maybe someone knows exactly how I'm feeling right now and maybe they have advice that doesn't sound cliche.  

Because it feels like I'm losing this battle inside of myself.  That my mind is constantly disagreeing or flat out ignoring people's advice.  Feeling like I'm actually broken and the only thing that will solve it is killing myself.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1iaxat1/feeling_like_a_burden_or_that_im_seeking_attention/
SuicideWatch,I’m 23 and I don’t feel like I have a reason to live,"I have severe anxiety and I have no passions or direction in life. I’ve never been in a relationship and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to be in one. Social interactions drain me a lot and I feel like I’m way behind my peers. It just seems like they can all have fun together at parties  trips  game nights  I don’t fucking know. Meanwhile  I’m just stuck at home. I’ve always felt like a burden to everyone around me and I think honestly it would be better if I just wasn’t here. My family might be a bit sad but honestly  I still think it would be better in the long run if they were freed from the burden that is me. My dad is dead anyway  and I’ve never really had the best relationship with my mum. My sister is very social and likable so I think she’ll be able to find her place in this world relatively easily and find her people. So I think she would eventually learn to live with the fact that her fucked up sister killed herself.
I just don’t see the point in living",3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1hw6hqv/im_23_and_i_dont_feel_like_i_have_a_reason_to_live/
SuicideWatch,I feel like a burden to everyone around me,As the title suggests  I feel like a burden to everyone around me. I feel like such a financial burden to my parents; they’ve paid for me to have 2 therapists for the past 3-4 years and counting  I’ve had a lot of medical procedures in the past due to brain tumors  I’m in college now and they pay for it (which I’m extremely grateful for)  but if I wasn’t here they wouldn’t have to pay for it at all.  I feel like my brothers would be fine without me because they prefer each other more anyway. I don’t feel like I belong in my family either since I’m a transracial adoptee. My boyfriend would be better off without me because he could find someone that meets/satisfies his sexual needs a lot better. I know I’m not enough for him in that aspect of our relationship. I only have like 2 friends and they’d be fine without me because they have plenty of other friends and I’m sure they would barely even notice I was gone. ,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1hzf358/i_feel_like_a_burden_to_everyone_around_me/

SuicideWatch,I feel like a complete bum (17F),"I (17F) have just recently (and by recently I mean about a month ago) have dropped out of high school due to wanting to not only pursue other things but my mental health as well. I’m enrolled in an early childhood education course that starts next February  and I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression for years.

So in this time  I’ve been trying to look for a job  which hasn’t been going too well. I haven’t really had a hell of a lot of luck in that department since I’ve never had a job before  and the closest thing I’ve gotten to it so far has been two trial shifts at a donut shop  and I’m not even employed there yet because I’m not barista trained and will want me trained first before I get rostered shifts… and even with that that may take months of pursuing since they take forever to get back to me. And because of all of this  it’s meant that all I do at home are occasional pitch in’s around the house (e.g.  washing dishes  taking the bins out  feeding the cat) but in the grand scheme of things it’s obviously not much  and I know that. 

But as more and more time has passed  I feel like my parents’ (my Dad especially) treatment of me has seriously dropped of me because their opinion of me has probably dropped too since I left school. I still struggle getting up early in the morning and doing stuff around the house  and my Dad just yelled at me before because it was about 10:30 and I hadn’t even gotten out of bed yet  that I’m acting like a bum  and just telling me to even pretend like a give a shit about anything… and it really hurt to hear. I am in therapy  and have been for a couple of months now  but there hasn’t really been any noticeable positive change  so I think even that itself is something my parents are resenting because they have to pay for it. 

I just hate already feeling like a complete and total burden on people’s lives and that I’m not good enough  but I would feel far too guilty to take myself out of the equation as much as I would want to. I’m 17 and I’m already feeling guilty because I should be doing more or paying rent somehow even though all the money I have is what I’ve saved from birthdays and Christmas. I don’t want to be a bum but the way I feel makes everything so hard  and I want to be better  I really do. I don’t want to be disappointing people anymore.",5,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1h1jegy/i_feel_like_a_complete_bum_17f/

SuicideWatch,Feeling very worthless,I am struggling very badly with CPTSD and borderline personality disorder (quiet type). My roommate refuses to be understanding of my brain fog/lapses  my concentration issues and my dissociating. I am going to therapy and doin a lot of stuff to work on my mental health  but to no avail. I try so hard every day and he just yells at me every single day for hours about how stupid I am. Over small things like I took too long to do a task that he could've executed faster/better. I have a hard time remembering all of the steps of certain tasks and I try my best to execute them but if I miss one small step all hell breaks loose. I have tried over and over to try to get him to understand me but at the end of the day  he doesn't give a fuck. He only cares about what he's going through and expects everyone else to just cater to his emotional well-being. He lured me into living here with love notes and promises of taking care of me because my last roommate sexually abused me. I hate it here and he makes me want to die. I took 8 extra strength Tylenols the other night but only wish I had taken 8 more.,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1jh3y41/feeling_very_worthless/

This is such a common pattern in my life  I’m just so used to it I can laugh at myself. Everything lets me down and I let myself down  nothing can hold me up anymore because I’m not meant to be here. My soul is aching for a rest but I can’t even do the least for myself and end my life. It’s so hard to even get up in the morning and get out of bed  and it’s even harder trying to do something with my life  even if it means ending it. 

I just wanna end this all  why is it so much to ask for? It’s so hard to do anything. I’m so weak. Dumb. Stupid… 

I haven’t accomplished anything  not even the thing I really want the most  which is to kill myself.

SuicidalThots,Does this note sound super depressing or did I explain that it’s better this way,"So its come to this  death the end of  life. it scares people just thinking about it  but why it happens every day in so many different ways. most have faith to help cope this this inevitability  but I’ve come to terms with the fact that i have no idea of what happens. Is it eternal darkness  do i finally after all this time meet god and get sent to heaven or hell or does your consciousness get sent flying through the cosmos aimlessly exploring the universe. neither you nor i have this answer but what i am sure of if that my mind body and soul have been Exhausted I’m tired of being a disappointment to the ones I look up to i don’t Like school yet I understand it’s important. i’ve started to realize that i’m not human at least on the inside my reasoning for saying this is because i have nothing in common With any one i to i when i try to talk its like i’m speaking another language I can’t communicate And at the top of that it’s I have lack of emotion I feel too passionate about people but at the same time I could care less I can watch somebody die and then go eat afterwards  yet at the same Weep at the sign of cruelty and injustice I guess it’s because I’m so desensitized to death. Another reason why I feel so depressed is loneliness  I long for an emotional connection with someone be it as a  best friend  Or lover but even I know that would never work for I push people away because I can’t imagine someone think I’m attractive or fun to hang around I don’t know how to talk to people I can’t relate in any way other than being a stoner  more on that later. Another thing that really just hurts to see. That I know I’m unwanted I can see the looks by family members i can see the disappointment in there eyes. In your eyes I’m disheveled Corpse of what I want to was which I guess is true but And appearance such as long hair black leather  band shirts and everything else that I like is the only that gives me confidence. But I really want to leave this on a positive note such as instead of thinking about how terrible this is that I’m leaving this earth think about it as I’m no longer suffering because his life is true pain it really is I look in the mirror and I see something that I hate that I want to destroy I want to see freed from. The physical body I have chaining my soul to this earth and in death I’d be free. Mom although you were psycho I love you with all my heart and it hurts me to see you the way you are what Ive done to you.Papa Joe and hurts me and makes me cry to think about how this is going to affect you you’re going to be alone for right now reading this you’re probably weeping but its ok cause I’m always here with you. To my nana Who is always so sweet to me I’m sorry for wasting your time throwing away your love. To my sister who I annoyed the hell out of I don’t even know what to say other than I’m sorry for the 16 years of being a complete and utter asshole I always love you and I’m sorry. To the dark one yes even in death that will be your nickname for you but in short time knowing each other You’ve been one of the best things that ever happened to me I don’t know worse you were really mean to me and you really did hurt my confidence a lot when you made fun of my reading ability but also you helped my confidence by Tell me how good I’m drumming I was and other things that you complimented me on but the most important thing is you are my sister although you are not blood you’re better than blood and for that I’ll always love you. Lizzie you’re a brat but I love you I can tell you really didn’t like me that much but it’s OK i really didn’t like myself much either I will miss you a lot and I understand why I was really annoying and I did treat you like crap sometimes well most of the time. To Little Manny you were truly one of the best cousins a teenage punk could ever ask for really you’re almost like a dad to me words cant express how much you mean to me you are like the big brother I always wanted you made it your goal to make shure i was doing good and that i was on the right track you even tried to help me get a job. You never talk down to me and treated me like your equal for that i thank you for whom the bell tolls my friend. Now this letter is gonna be a book if i keep going on so im gonna make it quick think about the fact i die like this on my one account instead of a drug overdose or in a gang murder  be sad that im gone but don’t destroy your self thinking about it. Rember the good. Pleas dont blame the weed for it was the only thing keeping me from doing this sooner it was one of my few joys it helped me relax and not thing about death also it helps me be social. And don’t blame the music either its the only music i can relate to cas people like me make it. With that out of the way i can say good by. Oh yea the positive note I guess im free.

loneliness,suicide,"i got nobody. i have my parents  and I love and appreciate them but I’ve become a social recluse almost. feeling like a reject.


spending time in social settings has become hell. seeing ppl with their friends and SO’s. my social skills aren’t the best so its just really hard.

ive had friends and SO’s  but times have changed and things happened that made me realize that my friends were fake  and i got dumped by my gf. its been around a year now and im still thinking of it. pathetic.

i dont belong anywhere  and my loneliness is killing me. school  work  then go home and sleep or do more work.

It’s worse because i have made memories with my old friends and my SO’s  but now they’re all gone and i’m grasping to the little that I had which is about years ago now. Its like i got a free trial and I cant access the full package now.

ive been battling depression and loneliness for around five years now  and Ive hit my lowest point now. I dont wanna be here anymore. I cant stand another day. i dont know how much i can say here  but ive been planning. 

i cant stand going out and holding back my tears everyday.

loneliness, cheating  suicide or kill thoughts,"I have been subjected to a financial as well as a professional cheating by my close relative which is consider myself as a brother. I worked for him and because of his words I spend 3 years with him. He told me I will be rewarded at the end. My salary was pending for 21 months and I haven't asked him because I knew him he was struggling. I wanted to end my job in his company after one year but he told me to stay for bit more and it lasted to e years. But at the end he only paid me salary of 15 months without any increment. Ath the same time till my birth my father ( who died before my birth) took all his money ( my father was soo rich at that time ). They stayed at my house in which the father build it for us. My father died just after 6 months of marriage with my mother. So she went back to her home. So I was taken care off my grandparents. But still my house and an another small property was their and the house. Obtaining area was multi owned owners including me my mom and  my father's parents as per shariah rule. But my father's father was not interested in sharing that property and we went to court but in a cinema style incident our advocate cheated us.
While I was studying in 5th standard my mother married another guy and she gone with him and I was fully taken care of my mother's parents. But I heard they saying their inability to take care of me kid every day ( but they have done their duty well especially my grandmother) . In my childhood I was a pro introvert and I don't have much friends too. My plus 2 life gave me a new charactor. But after that I never had any new friends or others. I never had any girlfriends. Once I had a crush on collage   but all my so called friends where supporting a senior guy who also had crush on her. So I decided to stay away from relationships because I know I won't be having any such things and I know nobody will be loving me. 
Since then most of the time I speak with trees or some non living beings or even myself. After college I started earning and then my relative guy came to my life. 
Also on last month I bought the property ownership of my father's relatives and I wanted to sell my land and start a new career.But still they block the sale of the land and they never wanted me to be a success man. 
I never misbehaved with any of the people or i somehow wanted to be nice with everyone. But no one loves me back or even some people even without any reason wanted me to get hurt. Now I am getting the suicide thoughts or like some one is murnering to kill the guys who cheat me or to commit suicide and escape from the world. Right now I don't have any job  no gf  no home   no money and nothing .

loneliness,i contacted the suicide hotline ,"i wasnt at risk or anything  but i was really desperate for somebody to talk to about my problems and i had pretty kow expectations when going in...but i came out pleasantly surprised. i learned things about myself that i never realized before. i realize that i make my own life difficult with how often i spend my time self loathing and how much i think about how useless and unproductive i am. my problem has been me the whole time bro



like yeah ive had many many factors in my life that led me to where i am today like my long history of being abused by other people  but the person i spoke to told me that my worth isnt defined by how people treat me...and dude. when i read that. i cried. i looked in the mirror and i fucking cried. i needed to hear that so badly its insane. 



i also learned that its okay to exist...im not a very productive person most of the time and i often beat myself up for that  but   its okay to just exist. even if im not employed right now...my dad will still love me and wont abandon me. especially since hes spent most of his life fighting custody for me

loneliness,Thoughts of non-existence and suicide within the context of loneliness,"I have realized that  when alone  but when im not fully isolated  such as when i have goone to clasroom or some friend has talked to me that day  I will most of the times end up with the track of thought of ""phisical non-existence would be better""  sometimes with and sometimes without the suicidal tone that is normaly added to that sentence.

Should this fact be contrasted by itself  it may seem like textbook depresion  which it's why these other 2 facts seem so fascinating to me.

The first   that when with those persons  I most of the time feel good  not great by itself  but definitely not suicidal. 

Yet when I have not contacted with anyone for a few days  like it's common with my semiperiodic self isolation phases  I feel okay. Not great  not even good  but I definitely feel better than a few hours after the ""social contact"" itself.

I think that this may be due to that when I'm with someone I realize all I'm missing in a social life  such as friends and people who love me  which  come the time I am finally alone and the ""social feromones"" have gone down  I realize my life is shit.

I've come to say to myself ""I hope it gets better or worse""  in the meaning that having someone to be with as myself and love is good  absolute loneliness does seem bad  but the middle point  when I'm lonely but not lonely enough to be ignorant of my loneliness is hell in my own bedroom.

I could have a few people around me but I prefer loneliness over friends who makes me anxious   i always choose self respect and peace over toxic relationships so thats why I'm lonely  I've experienced good friendships and bad ones  but all of them has ended somehow wich Is fine! 
It's difficult to maintain self love when you're not supported   still I'm really grateful for supports that I've got in life  but people aren't our objects we cant force them or beg them for attention. so they come and go   or they may take time away on their own  being busy with life  self discovery  enjoying other people's company. For a while or forever.

Specially in this difficult days of getting ready for important life changing exams and studying for 12 hours a day!

loneliness,Lonely Depressed,"Hi 

I 26 M have been struggling with connection through out my life and would go years in between some relationships that never last more than 6 months.

My confidence has never been “healthy” and recently has been the lowest that it’s ever been.

I’ve had hinge for a few weeks and have gotten 2 matches. 1 of which messaged me first last week. We hit it off on the app and set a date 2 days later to get a drink after her short work shift. She mostly inniated idea of coffee & card/board game for a first date.  We ended up changing this to a drink cus her shift was in the Am.

I recommended a spot and she did not respond for 24 hours which concerned me considering she was triple texting me and i thought we liked each other. She texted me morning of date and said she had to bail but implied we could reschedule. 

So far  she hasn’t responded but even if she did i don’t think that I should entertain her behavior to me taking day(s) to get back to me. 

This sparked my anxiety and on Sunday i spent day watching football game and My friend (who is crazy popular) introduced me to his friend that’s a girl. 

She was nice to me and we had things to talk about. She came alone only knowing my friend who introduced us in a group of maybe 11-13 people. She was the only single girl but not only girl. So when he was talking to other friends me and her would talk. 

End of night a different guy in the group walked her home. I was very upset/ jealous and already upset from Hinge date ghosting me yesterday.

I long for connection and have resorted to making a wall of pillows in my bed to feel like i am next to someone.",3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1ib6x71/lonely_depressed/

loneliness,32 m  going through a hard time again in life. Depressed  lonely  feel empty. Just need someone to talk to.,"I’m 32  going through a rough time yet again. Living with my ex but separately in the same house. For the time being at least. We had been together for about 3.5 years. Living together a majority of that.   She was my best friend  but now I don’t have that anymore. We were together almost every day  I have friends  but I guess we have become distant due to the nature of my relationship.. it’s hard to reach out to anyone. Even my family  I hate the feeling of being a burden. Everyone has their own life and problems  lately I just have been so down  depressed  empty. Drinking to forget about shit.

Somehow I always manage to ruin the good things I have… honestly it’s just fucking hard. Sometimes I just sit for hours doing absolutely nothing. Some days I feel good enough to get out and do something. I spiral a lot at night. Because it’s the quietest and when I feel most alone.  I don’t even necessarily need to talk about my problems. Just someone to talk to  it’s hard when you just feel like you need someone but there is no one.

If anyone feels the same or just wants to talk about life or anything I’d appreciate that. All good if not. Thought I would try. Thanks for reading ",9,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1f7qsbz/32_m_going_through_a_hard_time_again_in_life/
loneliness,Had a breakup while studying abroad and am feeling lonely and depressed since then.,"

Last year  I came to Germany for my masters. I have been pretty independent my whole life and being on my own didn’t bother me much. I was single when I came here and was focusing on my career and getting integrated into the culture. Cut to 3-4 months after that  I was approached by a guy from my uni and we did hit it off. It was clear from the beginning that we were dating for something serious. We had our ups and downs and it seemed he was not that serious into me. Now here  I made a mistake and kept giving this thing a try. I kept trying to put in more efforts but he would always disappoint me by canceling plans  telling me he feels pressure etc. Suddenly  things started getting better after 2-3 months and he changed a lot. But the lying and hiding things still continued. Here is when I became restless and was fighting with him out of frustration. Everything he did made me feel miserable about myself. One fine day  he ended things with me saying I am too emotional and he can’t take it anymore. It all came a day after he said he is lucky to have me. This sudden shock made me feel terrible. This was almost 4 months ago. I went through a lot of panic attacks and anxiety and it affected my studies and part-time job. Now  most of my friends have gone back to our home country and I am all alone here. I can’t help but feel lonely and miserable. A part of me still feels angry that while I am all sad and miserable here  he is enjoying his life to the fullest. The things which he couldn’t do with me because he had no time he is doing now while I have failed in my life and can’t even get out of bed.

My other sister (23) only comes when we've gone to the cinema or a gig together.

They tend to make excuses all year.round when I've tried hinting so I tend not to bother anymore. When it's the summer  it's usually because it's ""too hot""  most of the other time  it's because my building doesn't have a lift (but it's only a small block of 8 flats) and they don't want to walk up the stairs. If they can't get a taxi to the door  they won't do it  despite the fact that I only live on the other side of the town centre.
All I want is for them to spend a few hours with me. To have a cup of tea  watch a film  have lunch or something  but they never even offer to do that outside  let alone come to my flat for it. I've visit them sometimes but I struggle going back to that house because it can still be a comfort for me and I'm struggle with knowing I'm leaving to go back to the flat. They can come here and leave easily  I can't do that as happily.

I spend most days hoping  and wishing that they might give a surprise visit  but they don't and I just want to stop expecting it but I don't know how to take away that small bit of hope. I have hobbies  but I get bored of them easily  I have no friends (in my city anyway) and an inability to make any because I'm rubbish at it. My mental health is just not doing well at the moment and I just feel like nobody cares or anything.",7,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1i4ag8g/how_to_stop_this_overwhelming_loneliness_feeling/

loneliness,how do you make new friends?,"**Hi.**

I have a somewhat long and maybe somewhat boring story  but it leads to what worries me the most right now.

I’m a 23-year-old man  and for as long as I can remember  people have always ""come"" to me; I never really chose my friends (except once  but that ended  and it was mere coincidence). I’ve kept my childhood friends since we started school together. Some joined along the way  but I don’t really remember how it all began. I’ve always felt some kind of noise or disconnect with them: they are nothing like me  we don’t share hobbies  and the conversations we used to have have lost meaning for me (when there are still any left).

It’s been six years since we graduated from school. They started university before me because I took a gap year  and now they’re graduating while I still have a year left. This has greatly affected our conversations and dynamics—it leaves me with a strange feeling  like we’re in completely different stages of life and there’s no real common ground anymore.

Since high school ended  we’ve only met up to drink and talk about life. Their conversations revolve around their relationships or topics that  in my opinion  should remain private. In general  I’m just not interested. The only thing that connects us is memories that don’t really mean anything anymore. I’ve come to the conclusion that they are no longer for me  and I’m no longer for them.

This feeling became even clearer when my partner’s friend started dating what used to be my best friend. He changed for the worse when he started dating her—he became someone completely different  and not in a good way. Now she hangs out with my friends without me. They still invite me  but I no longer want to go. On top of that  she used to be my friend  but our friendship fell apart  and now she has become a bridge between them that I was left out of. I think this was the last piece I needed to realize that I no longer belong there.

As for my university friends  I feel like they all have too many problems. I feel like a drain for their misery  and apparently  ""that’s what friendship is.""

I’ve always been there for the people who have sought me out. I always respond when someone needs help  within my capabilities. But when I go through a rough time  no one is there for me.

I have bipolar disorder type 2  and lately  I feel an overwhelming loneliness. I no longer find meaning in living; I just feel like I exist. My partner is my only friend  and I don’t want to exhaust that resource.

I’ve realized that I need to meet new people—people with common interests  people I can talk to about things I enjoy  do things together  and build synergy toward shared goals. But honestly  I don’t know how to do that.

That’s why I’m writing here. I’ve tried meeting people through games like Valorant or LoL  apps like Bumble BFF or Boo. I’ve also thought about looking for communities related to my hobbies or interests on Discord or Reddit. But deep down  I feel like I don’t know what I’m doing. It doesn’t feel natural. I have no hope that it will work.

Sometimes I feel like I’m asking for too much  but I just don’t know what to do. Has anyone been through something similar? Do you have any advice or suggestions on how to meet people in a more genuine way?

loneliness,Ever feel like social media is quietly making things worse?,"I came across a study that found around **40% of young people in mental health treatment** reported *problematic social media use -* as in  feeling anxious  frustrated  or even angry when not online.

What struck me is that this kind of use shares traits with addiction: cravings  disrupting daily life  and not being able to stop even when it’s hurting you. These individuals also reported worse depression  anxiety  and suicidal thoughts.

It’s not about saying “just quit social media” - for some  it’s a lifeline. But it made me wonder:

loneliness,I don’t have nobody ,"
My name is Anthony Bookman. My wife passed back in may  and ever since everything went down hill we was struggling beforehand but getting by but after her passing it’s 10x worse all we had was each other. She was from the Philippines but moved here with her aunt and her aunts husband which they were practically upper middle class her family over here are doing well. Her side of the family are rich compared to me and my family which I barely have. You see I was born at 6 months 3 months early due to my mother’s crack addiction I was a breach baby I literally stepped into this world ( I came out foot first) she found out she was pregnant with me at 3 months and continued to do what she do. I think she was trying to get me aborted by crack idk lol but I survived. She never told me the truth about my father which I never met because she was ashamed to admit that she was a prostitute. I was the black sheep of the family I’m the middle child and she always treated me differently. My older brother and little brother was never subjected to the beating she gave me. She was so quick to punch me in my face and embarrass me in front of my friends and girls to keep me humble I guess because I don’t look like anyone I’m related to even though we have a very little family members on my mother side. I was always made fun of and told that they found me in front of Taco Bell because I look Hispanic due to my features. I’m black but due to not knowing my father my ethnicity always is questioned and always asked what else I am mixed with and reluctant to say. I was always jealous of my brothers because they have relationships with they father and came around gave them gifts and took them to places but I had to play it off like it didn’t bother me because whenever I asked about my father she would get mad and make it a big thing about it so I had to learn to keep my mouth shut. So naturally to gravitated to the streets looking for acceptance and subconsciously love I never received in the house hold.  When my mother was pregnant with my little brother when I was 15 I got locked up for robbing the pizza man due to it was never no food in the house because my brother was having a baby also at the same time so majority of the time they was eating out and only time they was bringing in food was for themselves so I had to fend for myself which marked me for a lifetime of struggling to find a career because who wanted to hire a convicted? I was charged as an adult btw. I tried to join the military and rejected. I wanted to go to college but didn’t know what I was doing I didn’t know how to fill out the fasfa application so I just gave up and continued down the wrong path. I was given a settlement at 18 due to getting hit by a car when I was 9 and luckily my grandma before she passed when I was 12 set it up for me to get it when I was 18 because my mother is a narcissistic money hungry delusional selfish person who only cares about herself and her house always comes first. When I turned 18 which I was still in high school I moved out and me and my brother got a apartment which I paid for and him and his baby mother moved into and me being so naive and so happy to be on my own I allowed them to take advantage. I gave my nephew his own room and they had a room and I slept in the living room. I helped put me and my brother through driving school and bought my brother a car. My mother was mad because she couldn’t control me since I was out her house even though I have her 2 000 dollars before we even left the bank. I was awarded 20 000 btw which 5 000 had to go to the lawyer that represented me for the robbery case and agreed to wait till I turn 18. One day my mother called me and demanded that I give her 1 000 dollars just cause with a attitude and in reply I said what you trying to pimp me or something and till this day she tells everyone I never gave her anything and say that was my reply when she asked me for money. I was trying to be conservative and didn’t want to run through my money but in 18 months it was gone. I checked my account one day and I only had 1 000 only to find out that my mother was stealing from me it took me 8 years to put it together I must of had a mental block because I didn’t want to believe it but her address was where I was getting checks and my bank information sent to and when I brought it to her attention about my account status and what I should do because I was highly upset and didn’t know at the time about disputing the charges to my account she played dumb and acted like it wasn’t nothing I can do and she didn’t know what to do so it was back to square one. She always allowed my brother and his family to move back in with her but when it came to me I always had to find a way and beg people to sleep on their couch or house which I never was able to get myself together because I always had to find a place to lay my head at which led me back to the street and another conviction of robbery in which I did 2 years prison time of robbing a drug dealer who told on me. I came home sold drugs here and there and at 25 had my first daughter with a girl I barely knew I got her pregnant having a threesome with her homegirl. I was working temp jobs to stay afloat and then two years later I met the love of my life. She was the only person who showed me love and truly cared about me and my wellbeing and I think she had pity on me because of how I would always bend backwards for the people who shitted on me and opened my eyes about the treatment of my family and that isn’t the way i was supposed to be treated. She ended up getting pregnant with our son Aj and it was basically us against the world and at 3 my son was diagnosed with level 2 autism which strengthened our love and relationship even though our relationship was going up and down like anyone else’s. She passed on may 23 2024 and ever since I haven’t been the same. I lost the only person who truly loved me and now it’s just me and him. We currently in a hotel shelter and I haven’t been able to work do to not having no help or be able to afford a babysitter and the time he goes to school it’s hard to find employment in between the time of that. I’m still waiting on ssi for his medical condition and her survival benefits and it’s super hard and stressful. I’m still grieving but I have to stay strong for our son and luckily she has a strong family relationship who loves our son and takes him from time to time and holidays which I’m very grateful because I never had that growing up. Birthdays and Christmas is just another day for me because after my grandma passed that stuff stopped and now I’m basically at my ropes end and don’t know what to do. I donate plasma twice a week so we can eat for the week and our social service benefits which we was barely getting by on was cut in half which is now basically impossible to get through the end of the month on. I’m getting 150 in foodstamps and 300 in cash benefits and my phone bill is 140. I did have a government phone so I didn’t have bill but it was always breaking easy or getting cut off due to the people I sign up with scamming and signing up people with my info causing my phone getting cut off. I went through at least 30 of them phones. My Facebook was recently hacked and it had all of me and my wife memories and the birth of our son so I had to make a new one but hopefully soon I be able to get back into it so I don’t lose it. But long story short if anyone can help that would be greatly help just look up my
Name on facebook I recently made it but my original facebook page is Tone Bookman and you will see I’m not bullshitting or trying to scam people.

Her family do the best they can they would send me 100 dollars at the end of the month when I ask but I try to not over do it I hit her stepfather around the 15-20 of the month so we can make it until the cash assistance hit on the second but truthfully it’s not enough. If I can get a car I can DoorDash and do much more and be able to keep us afloat. It’s much more I can go into about

loneliness,I feel like giving up ,"I've probably gone through CEN which has completely messed up my life. I'm 16 and from the age of 14 I've been experiencing intense loneliness  on and off depression  porn addiction. I've lost interest in everything  in every hobby of mine  studies and everything. I'm in 12th grade now and I'm not even studying! People say 12th grade is important for your career and college but I just don't the energy to study. I don't even have the energy to get out of my bed  to brush my teeth. 

I crave for love  someone to see me  understand me and appreciate me soooo much. I can't even explain. Sometimes I just spend nights crying just because of this and sleep around 4-5 am  waking up with swollen eyes. I have no friends I can turn to  my relationship with my parents is not good. They don't understand anything that I do  they don't appreciate me for the good things. They always keep talking about themselves  their likes  dislikes and just themselves. They don't even know who I am as a person. They don't know who their son is  his personality and all. 

My low self-esteem and perfectionism makes things even more harder. I don't find joy in my hobbies and interests anymore like playing guitar. Just holding guitar in my hands makes me tear up. Makes me feel heavy in my chest. My social skills are not good at all. I'm like an outcast in my high school with no friends. No one understands me  no one sees me. Why? Because I don't keep scrolling fucking instagram and play games all day like them. My personality is completely different from everyone maybe because of how I was raised. Just being alone in my head. Socializing is so hard for me  the fear of rejection and all  even my friends poke me that I'm an asshole I can't even be confident in front of them and all. I just can't explain how hard it is  spending all these years alone locked inside your home and then you imagine that when you'll get into teenage  everything will be alright but then you realise that everyone is so different from you and you don't have the skills  you've developed so many fears over all these years that it feels impossible. Loneliness is my main problem because it stems from my childhood and it feeds all the other. 

I've tried my best to control myself. Meditated for hours  journaled  tried a bunch of things out but nothing helps. Wish there was magic in this world so I could've felt better instantly. I'm still here and I haven't taken my life because I still believe someone will help me get through this. I don't think this belief is gonna last long.

loneliness,Therapy ,"I’ve tried it many many times  even been on medication for depression and it just doesn’t work for me. I think therapy just helps you accept your situation and doesn’t pretend to give you advice on how to overcome whatever is causing you pain. Accept loneliness  poverty  fatness  misery  death of someone  etc. I think for me what has sort of worked was just doing a lot of hobbies to get my mind off of my loneliness. Or working out a lot until I was too tired to notice how lonely I am. Therapy was just me crying on a couch on how pointless my life was and the therapist just listening or prescribing medication or making me journal (I’m not into writing or literature  sorry; do a lot of it at work  not about to do it on my free time). 
Some people have been judgmental towards me however  because this year  I’ve decided I’m going to voice my feelings and say I don’t believe in therapy and will die on this hill. So it’s all right for people to claim they are atheists for example  (I’m catholic and believe in god) and I’m supposed to be tolerant  but they can’t be tolerant towards me when I say I’m not going to therapy because I don’t believe in it. I’m not an addict  I’m very responsible in my job  I clean myself and maintain my house  I’m active and feed myself properly- I don’t need therapy or medication as I’m a functional adult. I don’t judge those who do believe they need it  but I’ve tried it and it doesn’t work for me; rather get a dopamine hit from sports  the gym  shopping  or getting payed well for my work.

I was only 17 when my grandpa died and just turned 18 when my grandma died. i don’t talk to my younger siblings and my older siblings moved away. I was left with my aunt and she was a slob and it was horrible. I ended up moving out and my job has been cutting my hours and it’s just been hard. I was with a girl but it turned out she was with someone else the whole time and ofc she dropped me.  my whole life i have felt like a nobody. i’m just here because my mom had me.

loneliness,I'm building an app to help address the loneliness epidemic. Would love your honest feedback!,"Hey everyone 

I’m a computer science and design master’s student who wants to make the world a little better. For the past few months  I’ve been working on an app idea  and I’d love to hear your thoughts.

I personally struggle with making friends and have mild social anxiety. It can be really rough some days. I’ve tried a bunch of social and friend-making apps  but I’ve never felt good about any of them.

**The idea is simple:**

Instead of focusing on dating-like profiles  awkward meetups  or curated dinners  this app gives you small social challenges to help you step outside your comfort zone in the real-world.

It meets you at your current social comfort levels and integrates challenges into your daily routine. For example:

* If you regularly go to cafes  take public transport  or go the gym but never actually talk to anyone  it might challenge you to give a genuine compliment  start a small conversation about a suggested topic  or even just say hi.
* The goal is to help you practice social skills in low-pressure situations for those who find it intimidating or challenging to talk to new people.
* It can also track your progress over time and see how different challenges and situations impact your nerves or feelings of loneliness.

My philosophy is this: If I can go about my everyday life being open  curious  and willing to interact with those around me  I can naturally find acquaintances  friends  best friends  opportunities  or partners.

loneliness,Help with loneliness,"Hello. I'm 37 years old and truly feel ready for life to finish. Everyday I experience loneliness and regardless of what I do I can never shake that feeling. For years  I had this belief that one day I would find love but after that delusion started fading away a couple of years ago  I've never been the same and slowly descending. That delusion kept my hopes up my whole life when I got my heart broken each time. I can get dates and even had relationships but I always went with women I truly didn't love in hopes that maybe that feeling would change. In the end  it didn't and both of us ended up feeling worse. It was a learning experience for me. Unfortunately I've never had a girl that I like  like me. I looked into a lot of self improvement and just being myself but no matter what I did  it truly felt like I was cursed. 

I exercise 3-4 days a week  go on frequent walks  tried making friends at work and social events  tried social and dating apps but nothings helped my mental health. I've even moved twice in the last 3 years in hopes that a new town would re-energize my life. When I finish work  I find myself sometimes just staring at my tv screen and walking around my house as I'm starting to lose my desire to enjoy the hobbies I used to enjoy. Most of my friends I still keep in touch with but they are often busy with their families. The only reason why I've not pulled the plug yet is because I don't want my parents to suffer but I truly don't know how long I'm gonna last.",12,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1jlspod/help_with_loneliness/

spending time in social settings has become hell. seeing ppl with their friends and SO’s. my social skills aren’t the best so its just really hard.

ive had friends and SO’s  but times have changed and things happened that made me realize that my friends were fake  and i got dumped by my gf. its been around a year now and im still thinking of it. pathetic.

i dont belong anywhere  and my loneliness is killing me. school  work  then go home and sleep or do more work.

It’s worse because i have made memories with my old friends and my SO’s  but now they’re all gone and i’m grasping to the little that I had which is about years ago now. Its like i got a free trial and I cant access the full package now.

ive been battling depression and loneliness for around five years now  and Ive hit my lowest point now. I dont wanna be here anymore. I cant stand another day. i dont know how much i can say here  but ive been planning. 

i cant stand going out and holding back my tears everyday.

loneliness, cheating  suicide or kill thoughts,"I have been subjected to a financial as well as a professional cheating by my close relative which is consider myself as a brother. I worked for him and because of his words I spend 3 years with him. He told me I will be rewarded at the end. My salary was pending for 21 months and I haven't asked him because I knew him he was struggling. I wanted to end my job in his company after one year but he told me to stay for bit more and it lasted to e years. But at the end he only paid me salary of 15 months without any increment. Ath the same time till my birth my father ( who died before my birth) took all his money ( my father was soo rich at that time ). They stayed at my house in which the father build it for us. My father died just after 6 months of marriage with my mother. So she went back to her home. So I was taken care off my grandparents. But still my house and an another small property was their and the house. Obtaining area was multi owned owners including me my mom and  my father's parents as per shariah rule. But my father's father was not interested in sharing that property and we went to court but in a cinema style incident our advocate cheated us.
While I was studying in 5th standard my mother married another guy and she gone with him and I was fully taken care of my mother's parents. But I heard they saying their inability to take care of me kid every day ( but they have done their duty well especially my grandmother) . In my childhood I was a pro introvert and I don't have much friends too. My plus 2 life gave me a new charactor. But after that I never had any new friends or others. I never had any girlfriends. Once I had a crush on collage   but all my so called friends where supporting a senior guy who also had crush on her. So I decided to stay away from relationships because I know I won't be having any such things and I know nobody will be loving me. 
Since then most of the time I speak with trees or some non living beings or even myself. After college I started earning and then my relative guy came to my life. 
Also on last month I bought the property ownership of my father's relatives and I wanted to sell my land and start a new career.But still they block the sale of the land and they never wanted me to be a success man. 
I never misbehaved with any of the people or i somehow wanted to be nice with everyone. But no one loves me back or even some people even without any reason wanted me to get hurt. Now I am getting the suicide thoughts or like some one is murnering to kill the guys who cheat me or to commit suicide and escape from the world. Right now I don't have any job  no gf  no home   no money and nothing .

like yeah ive had many many factors in my life that led me to where i am today like my long history of being abused by other people  but the person i spoke to told me that my worth isnt defined by how people treat me...and dude. when i read that. i cried. i looked in the mirror and i fucking cried. i needed to hear that so badly its insane. 



i also learned that its okay to exist...im not a very productive person most of the time and i often beat myself up for that  but   its okay to just exist. even if im not employed right now...my dad will still love me and wont abandon me. especially since hes spent most of his life fighting custody for me

loneliness,Thoughts of non-existence and suicide within the context of loneliness,"I have realized that  when alone  but when im not fully isolated  such as when i have goone to clasroom or some friend has talked to me that day  I will most of the times end up with the track of thought of ""phisical non-existence would be better""  sometimes with and sometimes without the suicidal tone that is normaly added to that sentence.

Should this fact be contrasted by itself  it may seem like textbook depresion  which it's why these other 2 facts seem so fascinating to me.

The first   that when with those persons  I most of the time feel good  not great by itself  but definitely not suicidal. 

Yet when I have not contacted with anyone for a few days  like it's common with my semiperiodic self isolation phases  I feel okay. Not great  not even good  but I definitely feel better than a few hours after the ""social contact"" itself.

I think that this may be due to that when I'm with someone I realize all I'm missing in a social life  such as friends and people who love me  which  come the time I am finally alone and the ""social feromones"" have gone down  I realize my life is shit.

I've come to say to myself ""I hope it gets better or worse""  in the meaning that having someone to be with as myself and love is good  absolute loneliness does seem bad  but the middle point  when I'm lonely but not lonely enough to be ignorant of my loneliness is hell in my own bedroom.

loneliness,Can't make it on my own any longer,"My (41 F) life in a nutshell:

I grew up in a dysfunctional family with physical and mental abuse. Was bullied at school. Started drinking and taking drugs as a teenager.

In my mid-twenties  I found a spiritual community that helped me out of that lifestyle and a few years later  I left my home country and moved to a place where this community is more active. Lost contact with all of my old friends.

Have always been struggling to fit into society  dropped out of university and got a job but burnt out in my early 30's. Was diagnosed with autism and adhd around that time. Also ended up homeless  was moving around a lot between 2014 and 2018 with no place to rest while also suffering from major depression and serious fatigue. Got no support from my family  they only carried on with mental abuse so I cut off ties with them.

Got disability pension 2018 at the age of 35. Found a decent place to live but also isolated myself totally since then. Was also in a destructive relationship  ended it in late 2019 since he threatened to beat me up and kill me. Then pandemic happened and I got even more isolated.

Left the spiritual community last year since I found out they're a cult; got no real support from them whatsoever  they just manipulated me into thinking that all negative things happening to me are my own fault and result of my past actions  and there was nothing I could do about it and that I was on my own. Got contact with some cult survivor groups and made close friends with one person online. Soon we developed romantic feelings to each other and since a couple of months or so we've been in a long distance relationship. He's been my everything since then but just like me  he suffers from ptsd and has since 10 days or so behaved very weirdly. Isolated from the rest of the world  hardly responding to my messages and when he does  it takes nearly one day or so.

I think I'm having a mental breakdown  I'm nearly suicidal. What's the point of going on with life? It's only been a series of tragedies and I seem to make terrible mistakes all the time. Have zero friends I can rely on and I'm too broken to make it on my own. Thought that me and my boyfriend (or maybe I should consider myself single at this point?) would have supported each other and start a new life together but it seems he's not on the same page anymore. I just can't cope with him disappearing  not giving me any kind of validation or showing any signs that he wants to communicate with me and sort things out. So on top of all this  my heart's also broken now.

After a life like this  how can I carry on without family or friends or anyone to rely on? I just want to give up",2,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1jmo7da/cant_make_it_on_my_own_any_longer/

loneliness,I hate my life and want to end it,"Idk why I am typing this... just created this account because I am this desperate for help. 

Everything in my life is shit. I just don't know what to do anymore.. I feel like killing myself..
I can't even stick to my workout schedule because I am this suicidal.. I hate eating. It's the same shit everyday and also exhausting. The fact that I am human also disgusts me in a way. I am just ashamed of myself.. I have noone. My dad died last year.. my birthgiver on the other hand who I live with is an abuse piece of ... (not gonna call names although I would want to say so much bad shit about this person.. ugh feel like vomiting)... literally traumatized by her. I believe that she is a narcissist. 

Anyways.. regardless of that I can't find to seem joy in life anymore. Everything is draining me. Feel like a piece of fat shit and am afraid of loosing my muscles that I have built. I have already not been active at all for about 2 weeks I believe and I just hate this feeling of loosing my strenght  rusting and becoming weaker and weaker.. 

I did watch lots of movies the past week being in another depressive episode again  which I am still in..  and watching some funny videos here and there laughing but I am still being tormented in my insides by everything that has happened to me and the pain I am feeling..
I genuinely don't know if I can keep existing anymore. I have no energy to make new friendships.. I am scared of people.. scared of abuse or being threatened and treated like garbage.

The fact that I also crave love and compassion AND on top of all of that am a fuckin human being is so disgusting to me. I just want to vanish and have never existed in the first place. My birthgiver should have just gotten an abortion and that would've been best for me and probably for her too. I hate the fact that I am saying this but man I am hurt.

Noone wants me or needs me. Makes no difference if I am not here anymore. I do have my uncle (my dads brother) and a good friend of mine but man I ultimately don't give a shit if they suffer if I really decide to kill myself.. this is my life and I can do whatever the fuck I want. Why am I even here?! I just want this knife sticking through my chest to be gone. I can't live with it like this anymore. 

On top of that I can't seem to find a job.. been only getting rejections and my money is running out..
Luckily from tomorrow on I'll partially be in a psych ward... hope this will help but I still feel so lost. I don't know if it'll make a difference. After my 1 to 2 month stay there I will have to have a job and man I just don't think I can do it. If I just were financially secure and had a loving home (instead of a sick toxic place) things would be so much better for me.. 

I hate being an adult.. I just feel like a lost small boy.. no matter how old my body is my spirit will always be a small young boy running wild in his dreams..

Idk Idk Idk...

Idk man.. I am really lost here. Whatever.. 
I am just lost.. forever..

Edit: So it seems that it'll take a little longer until I can go to the psych ward. Hopefully no later than a week but it's also not promised so yeah.. this is not good.

loneliness,Asking for help // does anyone relate  can I get better?,"I think I was born without the primal feeling that makes you care about your own survival. Everything I do feels superficial. For years I have isolated myself. I've always said I wanted to run away but I know if I was anywhere by myself i would be self neglectful. If left alone without responsabilities  with all the money in the world and no one to be responsible for other than myself  I wouldn't bother making myself food  getting out of bed or trying to do anything with my money. I have never been able to visualise my future  I've felt like I was meant to die young but it hasn't happened yet or something. I'm not actively suicidal or anything. I feel guilty  I have a home  loving parents  longtime friends  I have a job and an education. I know I am priviledged so why doesn't that matter to me. An old friend of mine passed away recently  two days before he moved to another country. I think about it everyday with guilt  he had a plan and potential and worth. He truly deserved to get a fresh start. Why am I the one that lives. I am grateful for what I have but It feels unappreciated. I know there is people I can talk to but I feel alone. For the last few years even at my happiest I've always felt it in the back of my mind. I don't feel worthy of life. Nothing extremely traumatic has happened to me  I have no reason for this. I like my appearance  I have hobbies but it's all superficial. I don't hate myself either it's about my instincts why don't I put myself first.
If I was given the chance I'd let myself rot to death. I look around and everyone has moved on  I've felt like this for years  I don't understand why I don't care for myself  why I don't have that survival instinct. I can't even say I gave up on myself cos I don't think I was ever there. If someone tried to kill me  adrenaline aside  I don't think id run  truly I feel like I deserve it. I know I'm wasting my life why don't I care to fix it. I'm constantly asking for a sign that I'm worthy or that there is a plan for me but I know that at the end it's not real and the only person that can fix this is me. I feel like a curse on those around me and I realise I am the problem but I don't know how to ask for help. I know this is stupid but do you believe in cursed souls like genuinely is there something wrong with me.

loneliness,What can I do,"I’m a 21-year-old female  the youngest of eight siblings  but I genuinely believe I’m the most unlovable  loneliest person who has ever lived. Appearance-wise  I’m below average—I’ve been made aware of this since elementary school. When my brother and I would play house with friends or cousins  the only person who wanted to be paired with me was my brother  which led to other issues I don’t need to get into.
As the youngest  my siblings were all too grown and independent to be close to our extended family  so it was just my siblings and me. Most of them have had issues with each other and aren’t on speaking terms  so I mainly grew up with my sister  who is six years older than me. You could say she raised me.
Although I really enjoyed people’s company  they didn’t feel the same way. I had very few friends  and I always felt like I was forcing myself on them or that they secretly hated me. I spent most of my school breaks walking around alone  in the bathroom  or sitting in the classroom with my head on the table  just waiting for the day to be over.
I had one friendship during middle school that keeps me together. Even though she preferred to hang out with her other friends during breaks  she was kind enough to love me for the rest of the day and chose to stay in classes with me instead of going with them.
When my sister—the one who raised me due to my incompetent mother—graduated  she went into a depressive episode and wouldn’t leave her room. Although I deeply sympathized with her  I couldn’t help but think she was selfish for leaving me alone when she knew she was all I had. Then  she found something silly I had said on the internet that she believed was “disrespectful to God” and told me not to speak to her because of it. Her reaction was extreme  but I still stopped talking to her for the entire two years she stayed in her room. Even after she came out  we never returned to the way we were.
During those two years  I went through one of the most transitional periods of my life—I got into university. I didn’t make friends  always felt awkward and out of place  and no one spoke to me  but it was still miles better than school.
My brothers have children  and I was happy because I thought  Finally  someone who isn’t years older than me that I can befriend. But that didn’t happen. Sometimes they were nice  and I felt extremely happy and full of love because I have so much to give. But then  other times  they weren’t  and I could feel how uncomfortable they were around me. They would say some of the meanest things I’ve ever heard.
Once  I was chatting with one of my sisters  and she kept talking about how “ugly” one of our cousins was—while describing me. Another time  she came into my room and accused me of being jealous of her. When I had bangs  she laughed at me for “attempting to be pretty.” Over time  I realized she just hated me  so I stopped speaking to her completely.
My mom also hates me  but she has always been a horrible mother to all my siblings. She constantly compares me to my father  saying I’m evil. She blames me for everything bad that happens. She calls me greedy. She pushed me when I refused to lie to my father like she wanted me to. She starts problems and then plays the victim.
My dad and I were never really close—he’s just there.
I’m still in university  and I’ve made some friends  but the relationships feel purely transactional. They only text when they need something. Most of the time  everyone is just trying to get rid of me so they can be with their real friends. I feel forgettable. I’ll participate in something with an instructor  and they’ll name everyone who was involved—except me.
In every classroom  I’m at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Even with the group of “friends” I have  I’m always the ugliest one  the one left out. When I’m around people  they constantly get complimented while I just stand there  unnoticed. Everyone I interact with seems to have something negative to say about me—to my face.
My family hates me. I have no real friends. Every comment I’ve ever received about my appearance in 21 years has been negative. No one has ever complimented me. No guy has ever looked at me. No one has ever wanted to befriend me.
I’m not very smart. I’ve struggled with my body for as long as I can remember.
I don’t see myself killing myself  but I also don’t understand what’s keeping me going. I spend most  if not all  of my days in my room—not because I enjoy it  but because there’s nowhere else for me to be.
Does anyone know what is going on or what can I do LOL?",3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1ivssrt/what_can_i_do/
loneliness,39M I’ve never felt more alone ,"
I'm 39  and  I am in exact same situation -- never had a girlfriend  had sex  never even kissing a girl. I'd be happy to give some insight straight from the horse's mouth. from time to time  and if you're in the know and can identify with a certain lived experience  it's easy to observe when someone is on the spectrum. I've always gleaned that from peoples mannerisms  my obsessive interests (video games and classic rock)  and my way of speaking (tone of voice  tendency to overenunciate words) that i have an autism spectrum disorder -- possibly diagnosed. Having autism is more than enough to render yourself as women-repellant just by sheer virtue of existing  without the upbringings that most autistic men have to suffer from. And even though a lot of what Bo is saying here are conjectures  his predictions on a lot of points I would say are pretty spot on. I could talk forever about the upbringing that got me here  but I'll try to distill it into a few essential cliff points: I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome when I was 13 years old when my grandparents noticed I couldn't make eye contact with people and had sensory processing issues that kept me from eating  as I would throw virtually everything I was fed right back up. My mother was the dominant parent in my household -- my dad wasn't around  but always seemed more interested in doing drugs. He was in and out of prison my whole childhood and then finally 3 years ago broke into my apartment and stole from me. than spending any quality time with me or the rest of my family. He was a negligent parent and bordered on abusive at times.He messed up the chance when I was 14 to have a stepmom yet again because of his drug problems. I had no other key male figures in my life except my grandfather  and had no brothers or male cousins (at least ones that were my age and lived close to me) -- I am an only child and all of my close cousins were female. I found sports boring as a kid  which made it hard to relate to my father and other boys at school. This plus the autism led to me being bullied pretty much my entire life going through school. I was also precocious as a child  known for being more developed in the intellectual/cognitive side of things than other kids my age. I always read/wrote several grades higher than my grade level. This caused teachers (and older people in general) to take bigger notice of me than the other kids  which meant I was watched like a hawk constantly and couldn't take the risks and missteps that other boys my age could get away with. I would be punished  called out  and reprimanded for doing way less than other boys  and this was a pattern that continued well into adulthood. This doesn't even begin to go into my history with girls. I never even had to ask out girls in school to become aware of my low value -- it was always something that other kids would bring up on their own accord and situations that I would be pulled into by them that reinforced that fact. I never started trying to date until university and even then  it was only a few half-hearted attempts here and there. Nowadays  I can give off a positive impression and seem to do ""okay"". I've haven't wanted to go to the gym because i don't want to see all the happy couples with their normie happiness shoved in my face because i have seen this pain in my face for 6 years working in retail let me tell you it hurt so bad everyday i would get up for work i would feel so drained to have to endure that pain daily to have to interact with the general public seeing something i will never have again is like dying a thousand deaths. I am bald now i miss my hair but it is what it is. I grow a beard or goatee even now that I'm almost 40. I am currently working a job in security making decent money and living on my own with totally alone -- though I am at a kind of crossroads point in my career where I will have to to betterr myself and work my way up in my current company which i have never been given the chance in my entire life up until now.if I want to stay healthy. It is a data centerr security job that is very easy and when i worked in retail was very taxing on my mental and physical health  so I probably won't stay ""attractive"" for long if I continue to work this job. So I'm now finally at a point where I could date and have some success if I was willing to put myself out there.... And I don't. Why? Because I just don't care enough to. My upbringing has completely killed my spirit  and I am finding myself at a point where I'm just finding it so hard to want to try. Throughout the entirety of my life  I've been made to feel as if the realm of sex  and dating  and relationships was a parallel society that I was never allowed to be a part of. It's almost a universal experience where the periods of middle school and high school and college are permitted as this period of discovery where people have their first experiences really gauging their worth in that arena  being attractive and being sexy and being charismatic and getting to share themselves with the opposite sex in an environment and consciousness that's carefree with little strings of attached. I never got to have that throughout that point in my life. That affirmation only came afterwards  as I got into my 20s i had made a mistake by meeting all the wrong women and even had a child with the wrong woman which i was never ready to be a father my daughter which is now 13 i haven't seen her in 7 years since by grandmother passed away and my last relationship was about to be on the rocks because my ex blamed me for not working even though she set the trap of telling me to not to work for 3 summers in a row and as a love sick fool i fell for it and it ultimately was my own down fall and fault being so emotional invested into someone who didn't return the feelings i had for them. and all of my peers had already built their confidence and success in that area. It makes me feel like I'm living a lie  where the lessons that I have had to learn from my upbringing were never real. And to me  that isn't fair. I feel so ashamed for not being able to develop in that way at a normal timeframe  at the same time that most people get to discover themselves and flourish. It wouldn't feel right for me to start now; it would all just feel like a big cope. Especially given that most days  it's hard to even just get up in the morning. I am so dead inside. After all  back in high school  the prospect of me even being seen with a girl was so ridiculous and offensive to people that even asking a girl out was out of the question. I don't deserve it. I'm not entitled to it. I was never owed it like all my peers were. I was disgusted. I was a creep. And when I'm made to feel that way without doing anything to anybody  I don't tend to take it lightly. I have a very hard time letting things go  and ultimately that is what has to change if I want to stop rotting in this situation. No amount of money  or gym  or confidence will fix that. I need serious help. And here we have a self-fulfilling prophecy.",10,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1h7org3/39m_ive_never_felt_more_alone/
loneliness, cheating  suicide or kill thoughts,"I have been subjected to a financial as well as a professional cheating by my close relative which is consider myself as a brother. I worked for him and because of his words I spend 3 years with him. He told me I will be rewarded at the end. My salary was pending for 21 months and I haven't asked him because I knew him he was struggling. I wanted to end my job in his company after one year but he told me to stay for bit more and it lasted to e years. But at the end he only paid me salary of 15 months without any increment. Ath the same time till my birth my father ( who died before my birth) took all his money ( my father was soo rich at that time ). They stayed at my house in which the father build it for us. My father died just after 6 months of marriage with my mother. So she went back to her home. So I was taken care off my grandparents. But still my house and an another small property was their and the house. Obtaining area was multi owned owners including me my mom and  my father's parents as per shariah rule. But my father's father was not interested in sharing that property and we went to court but in a cinema style incident our advocate cheated us.
While I was studying in 5th standard my mother married another guy and she gone with him and I was fully taken care of my mother's parents. But I heard they saying their inability to take care of me kid every day ( but they have done their duty well especially my grandmother) . In my childhood I was a pro introvert and I don't have much friends too. My plus 2 life gave me a new charactor. But after that I never had any new friends or others. I never had any girlfriends. Once I had a crush on collage   but all my so called friends where supporting a senior guy who also had crush on her. So I decided to stay away from relationships because I know I won't be having any such things and I know nobody will be loving me. 
Since then most of the time I speak with trees or some non living beings or even myself. After college I started earning and then my relative guy came to my life. 
Also on last month I bought the property ownership of my father's relatives and I wanted to sell my land and start a new career.But still they block the sale of the land and they never wanted me to be a success man. 
I never misbehaved with any of the people or i somehow wanted to be nice with everyone. But no one loves me back or even some people even without any reason wanted me to get hurt. Now I am getting the suicide thoughts or like some one is murnering to kill the guys who cheat me or to commit suicide and escape from the world. Right now I don't have any job  no gf  no home   no money and nothing . 
I donno what to do

loneliness,Stabbed in the back and cut from the throat,For a while I've been romanticless for basically the past 6 years now and soon to turn 19  I had a female friend who I kinda enjoyed chatting with and being friends with  she was basically my only hope that I could rely on for helping me unbind my loneliness  until now  I got suspended on Xbox for saying something I shouldn't have  for 2 days  now I go on to Discord to chat with her and I figure that I can't message her  I could message other people but I don't know why her specifically I couldn't message  maybe she deactivated her account  maybe she unfriended me despite saying nothing wrong  but overall  She stabbed me in the back while Microsoft cuts me in the throat to mute me from chatting on certain platforms for 2 day  maybe this all goes away and I was overreacting for nothing  or she is still unable for me to re-add her as a friend and I lost a good friend and I have travel back into the deep-end to find another female to be friends with.

loneliness,does anyone know if being lonely ever goes away?,I just want to feel okay by myself but I always feel a sense of crippling loneliness when I am alone. I try to distract myself by going out  having hobbies  and other things but it just seems as if nothing works. at the end of the day I just lay awake wishing I didn’t feel so alone. even when I am around people I still feel like the loneliest person in the room. I attempt to fill the void by jumping from relationships; I end up getting very attached because its the only thing that seems to ease my loneliness but they never work out. then I am left to feel even more lonely than before. I heard of people talk about things like “self love” but I just don’t know how to apply that to myself. it feels I am trapped inside my own mind and cant get out. I don’t know what im doing with my life anymore. I have friends and family that support and love me  honestly they are the only reason im still hanging on. I am starting to believe there is no way out of this. I want to find a way out on my own so badly but I cannot even stand being on my own.

loneliness,Can't make it on my own any longer,"My (41 F) life in a nutshell:

I grew up in a dysfunctional family with physical and mental abuse. Was bullied at school. Started drinking and taking drugs as a teenager.

In my mid-twenties  I found a spiritual community that helped me out of that lifestyle and a few years later  I left my home country and moved to a place where this community is more active. Lost contact with all of my old friends.

Have always been struggling to fit into society  dropped out of university and got a job but burnt out in my early 30's. Was diagnosed with autism and adhd around that time. Also ended up homeless  was moving around a lot between 2014 and 2018 with no place to rest while also suffering from major depression and serious fatigue. Got no support from my family  they only carried on with mental abuse so I cut off ties with them.

Got disability pension 2018 at the age of 35. Found a decent place to live but also isolated myself totally since then. Was also in a destructive relationship  ended it in late 2019 since he threatened to beat me up and kill me. Then pandemic happened and I got even more isolated.

Left the spiritual community last year since I found out they're a cult; got no real support from them whatsoever  they just manipulated me into thinking that all negative things happening to me are my own fault and result of my past actions  and there was nothing I could do about it and that I was on my own. Got contact with some cult survivor groups and made close friends with one person online. Soon we developed romantic feelings to each other and since a couple of months or so we've been in a long distance relationship. He's been my everything since then but just like me  he suffers from ptsd and has since 10 days or so behaved very weirdly. Isolated from the rest of the world  hardly responding to my messages and when he does  it takes nearly one day or so.

I think I'm having a mental breakdown  I'm nearly suicidal. What's the point of going on with life? It's only been a series of tragedies and I seem to make terrible mistakes all the time. Have zero friends I can rely on and I'm too broken to make it on my own. Thought that me and my boyfriend (or maybe I should consider myself single at this point?) would have supported each other and start a new life together but it seems he's not on the same page anymore. I just can't cope with him disappearing  not giving me any kind of validation or showing any signs that he wants to communicate with me and sort things out. So on top of all this  my heart's also broken now.

After a life like this  how can I carry on without family or friends or anyone to rely on? I just want to give up",2,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1jmo7da/cant_make_it_on_my_own_any_longer/
loneliness,Seeking excitement in depression,"Well loneliness isn't about a few or no people being around you  sometimes its noone waiting for you  asking you about your day  caring about your achievements   or even  thinking your hobbies and goals are stupid! I could have a few people around me but I prefer loneliness over friends who makes me anxious   i always choose self respect and peace over toxic relationships so thats why I'm lonely  I've experienced good friendships and bad ones  but all of them has ended somehow wich Is fine! 
It's difficult to maintain self love when you're not supported   still I'm really grateful for supports that I've got in life  but people aren't our objects we cant force them or beg them for attention. so they come and go   or they may take time away on their own  being busy with life  self discovery  enjoying other people's company. For a while or forever. 
As an 18 year old girl I feel like I need to glow  share and receive  explore and talk to people without being stressed. Having friends who care about me and i care about them. But I've been struggling to find a friend or a group of friends who can make me feel more supported and less isolated. Specially in this difficult days of getting ready for important life changing exams and studying for 12 hours a day!
Plus I'm having a long distance relationship   I'm grateful for him but at this point it's just me alone having to build a life before taking another step!

loneliness,I think something is wrong with me,"I really apologise for this really long post. If you do end up reading it thank you. Even that is enough. Sorry I sound like I'm complaining  I just don't really know where to go  I just really want someone to tell me what is wrong with me. 

I (28F) know it's common to think that there is something wrong when you're isolated. I've been told many times by my therapists  psychiatrists  past ""friends"" that there is nothing wrong with me. I get it. It's the easiest answer to give and who is actually analysing somebody that deeply? But I can't help shake this feeling. 

I always had problems making friends growing up. As a kid  a parent who  I guess  felt sorry for me ask her child to be friends with me. It worked  but we are not really friends (I'll get to why I feel like I'm not friends with any of these people in the end). High school I had no friends at all because I went to 7 high schools and couldn't be bothered to make friends knowing that I will change schools soon. In university I thought I made friends  but realising now that is not the case. And for the past 5 years I haven't spoken to anyone except saying ""hello  how are you"" at work.

Before I get into why I feel they are not my friends  here are the reasons why I think there is something wrong with me. Here are some reasons: 
- whenever I did hang around people and try to talk to them (I ask them about their background  I try to pick up on things that they like and talk it   gossip (though I hate gossiping)  talk about trends  news  sports  literally whatever they like) I see that once I stop asking questions or trying to carry the conversation they become silent and walk away. This was clear to me in parties in particular. 
- Another reason is  because I know people judge others base on appearances  which is fine  I tried my best to dress and look like others. I only did this when I notice people who dress and look similar hang out with each other. So I tried to follow and dress like them. This goes along with behaving like them. Despite this  people never like to talk to me.
- I remember in school and university  whenever we needed to choose partners for a project  I was always the last resort. 
- people keep forgetting I am there. One time a groups of friends drove off and left me in a small ski town because they forgot about me. I had to rent a car to drive back alone. It seems like I am invisible.
- It seems people never want to talk to me. A few times I had friends who had friends living abroad and they would make the effort to call them on the phone regularly. A lot of the times I was there when they made the call so I heard what they talked about... gossip  life updates  interest  travel. But it seems that when I talke about the same  they showed no interest. 

I know people drift away  I know that people have their own lives  I know people have their own problems  so I'm trying my best to be understanding and forgiving as possible. When I am around people I make an effort to smile  be energetic  talk about them and their interest  try to avoid talking about myself unless someone asks  I just try to be like others and how I observe them. But no matter what  it seems that people have some sort of aversion to me. The reason I don't think my past friends are my friends for the following:

- when my friends talk and catch up with their friends (as my last point above) they made the effort to call once a month or two. When I moved abroad I called those friends of mine  talked about similars things they like to talk about (and they enthusiastically talked about it with their other friends)  but once I stop initiating all connection was gone. I haven't heard from them since. 
- I don't care for my own birthday  I never did... But I always cared and celebrated my friends. I wished them a bday and then gifted something or planned something. I never expected anything in return  and they have said they have a hard time to remember peoples birthday  which is completely okay. However  I know that's a lie because I see them wishing  baking cakes  excitedly wishing their other friends birthdays (even though I've known them for longer... Not that that matters)
- whenever I expressed to someone that I have some mental issues  right away they distance themselves. Which again is okay because people have different capacities to cope with such things. However I see them being completely there for someone else. I even have one friend who works with people with mental health problem  but she turned her back on me  but not on others. 

Essentially I realise I have no friends because I see the capacity they have of being a good friend to others  but they don't reciprocate towards me. Despite me trying to be there for them. I know this sounds like a me versus them problem and I try not to view it that way  but as the years pass  it's hard not to get into that state of mind.

I thought initially it was just the group of friends I was hanging out with  but I tried making new friends with different people. I'm abroad for work and tried with different people. Nothing works. I don't know if I'm so incompetent in making friends. I don't know if I make others uncomfortable. I though maybe I was a narcissist  but doing all the test and asking my multiple therapists  they all say I'm definitely not. I just don't understand why nothing is working. 

This has been going on for sometime now  I see my behaviours and mental state is deteriorating. It's hard to smile  it's hard to have energy  it's hard to maintain conversations when people don't show interest  it's hard to be happy  even the idea of meeting new people exhaust me. I even try to do the opposite. Instead of caring and being the person that initiates  I tried toning it down  try to be ""cooler"" (I hate viewing things that way btw)  but all of that resulted in not one talking to me. 

I try not to be so dependent on people giving me happiness  but being socially isolated is like going against the hardware of being a social being. I'm tired of people telling me that you need to find interest or whatever generic advice (though I know it's coming from a good place  so I still appreciate it and I'm not angry)  I  have an interests and hobbies but being isolated still affects my mind. Not being able to connect with anyone around is causing me some concern. I'd rather live in the middle of a forest and be at peace there. I think it would be easier to come to terms with myself. 

Anyway  thank you for reading this far. I just needed to say this. If you have any clue what is wrong with me  or if you have similar experiences  please share  because I feel like my reality is slowly melting away.

loneliness,I feel so tired. Is this how my life is going to be?,"Is it always going to be like this?


I'm 22. I recently lost my parent in a really traumatic way. I miss them so much. They were the only person who ever cared about me in my entire life. I feel their absence everyday. I see the things they left behind and cry every day. I remember how everything happened. I can't get those images out of my mind. I'm completely alone now.

I'm just so lonely. I'm extremely boring and because of that when people get to know me they just slowly stop hanging out with me. I live alone. I don't have parents. No one likes me. I can't change my personality.

It's been like that since always. I have 0 friends. I never had a single friend in my entire life  even in my childhood I never had a friend. 

After losing my parent. I recently moved to this new place. People used to sympathize with me at start and used to talk to me.

 I used to hang out with these people. I tried really hard to socialize with them. But after knowing that how boring i'm  they've Started to exclude me now. They hang out without me now. They used to call me outside but not anymore. I don't want to insert myself in a group where i'm not wanted or needed. I feel like they have more fun without me.

I hear the sounds of their laughter and talking while I'm inside feeling lonely  crying and missing my dead parent. They know i'm alone inside alone they just don't care.

The cherry on top is that i'm poor too. I don't have any money. I can't do anything even if i want to. I literally don't have money for it. I'm barely getting by.

Everyone has a family around me. I hear them talk. I feel so jealous. Everyone has someone they can talk to  someone who cares about them. 

I have no one  literally no one who cares about me. It's been days since i last talked to someone and the last time i talked to someone was when i was buying groceries  yeah it was the cashier. Lol. Oh and i live in a third world country  did i mention that.

I don't feel like eating. I don't want to do anything. I don't want to get up every morning to do nothing all day. 
I want someone to care about me. I want to care about someone. I want someone to talk to. I go outside but nothing ever happens. I'm so uninteresting that no one wants to know me and when they get to know me they just leave. I want to stop crying. It physically hurts now.

Anyway if anyone read this till now  thank you so much.

loneliness,I hate my life and want to end it,"Idk why I am typing this... just created this account because I am this desperate for help. 

Everything in my life is shit. I just don't know what to do anymore.. I feel like killing myself..
I can't even stick to my workout schedule because I am this suicidal.. I hate eating. It's the same shit everyday and also exhausting. The fact that I am human also disgusts me in a way. I am just ashamed of myself.. I have noone. My dad died last year.. my birthgiver on the other hand who I live with is an abuse piece of ... (not gonna call names although I would want to say so much bad shit about this person.. ugh feel like vomiting)... literally traumatized by her. I believe that she is a narcissist. 

Anyways.. regardless of that I can't find to seem joy in life anymore. Everything is draining me. Feel like a piece of fat shit and am afraid of loosing my muscles that I have built. I have already not been active at all for about 2 weeks I believe and I just hate this feeling of loosing my strenght  rusting and becoming weaker and weaker.. 

I did watch lots of movies the past week being in another depressive episode again  which I am still in..  and watching some funny videos here and there laughing but I am still being tormented in my insides by everything that has happened to me and the pain I am feeling..
I genuinely don't know if I can keep existing anymore. I have no energy to make new friendships.. I am scared of people.. scared of abuse or being threatened and treated like garbage.

The fact that I also crave love and compassion AND on top of all of that am a fuckin human being is so disgusting to me. I just want to vanish and have never existed in the first place. My birthgiver should have just gotten an abortion and that would've been best for me and probably for her too. I hate the fact that I am saying this but man I am hurt.

Noone wants me or needs me. Makes no difference if I am not here anymore. I do have my uncle (my dads brother) and a good friend of mine but man I ultimately don't give a shit if they suffer if I really decide to kill myself.. this is my life and I can do whatever the fuck I want. Why am I even here?! I just want this knife sticking through my chest to be gone. I can't live with it like this anymore. 

On top of that I can't seem to find a job.. been only getting rejections and my money is running out..
Luckily from tomorrow on I'll partially be in a psych ward... hope this will help but I still feel so lost. I don't know if it'll make a difference. After my 1 to 2 month stay there I will have to have a job and man I just don't think I can do it. If I just were financially secure and had a loving home (instead of a sick toxic place) things would be so much better for me.. 

I hate being an adult.. I just feel like a lost small boy.. no matter how old my body is my spirit will always be a small young boy running wild in his dreams..

Idk Idk Idk...

Idk man.. I am really lost here. Whatever.. 
I am just lost.. forever..

loneliness,Cartoons are nice.,"I apologise for suddenly posting this. I am not sure if what I am feeling is loneliness or something else entirely  so I would like for anyone that is willing to read the entire length of my emotional odyssey know that I appreciate your effort  and thanks for reading. Disclaimer  my English is not that good  it's not my first language  so I apologise again.

I suppose  I'll start from the beginning  but before that  a bit about myself. I am 19  barely an adult  I know that at that age  emotions aren't supposed to be ""real"" or so they say. I was born into a ""toxic"" family  by my definition they are toxic  but I know others who would say that they aren't toxic at all.

When I was a kid  I had little to no friends. I can't remember much  but what I do know is that I never left my house to play with friends like a ""normal"" child (I don't really know what constitutes as normalcy) my parents never let me play with neighbour kids because to them ""we are not at their level"". So I spent most of my days watching cartoons at home. Time pass by and as I grew from kindergarten to elemantary  I never really had friends that I could talk to after class. My parents were always at work  and my brother lives with my grandparents. So I spent more time watching cartoons. My family always made fun of me when I watch cartoons  because to them I don't have a life. However  when I tried new things like drawing and writing  all that they did was treated what I made like a disappointment  never once did I get a nice feedback  it was always  ""it's okay"" and then I will find the paper in the trash. Maybe that was normal and I'm just weak.

Skip by a few more years  I am in highschool  I for once found friends that I can talk with after school (through discord mostly)  but as the years go by  we went astray  switching schools didn't help too. The next 1 and a half year of school was great  I had a few friends none were ever friend friend (if you get what I mean)  but I had friends. That all changed when I left school though. After graduation I worked a bit  never really had a human connection that left me feeling for more. It was always the connection where I won't be able to talk to them outside of work hours. Even with my effort to be friendly with everyone  no one seem to let me be a friend. 2 years later  here I am  almost ending my first year of college. I have friends  but they have better friends  people that they rather spend time with. At every run for the corner  I will always be the backup friend  always the guy they call when they need me  and never when they don't. 

Maybe I'm just unlikeable. So  I didn't mind much about it. But today  after accidentally stumbling upon a clip from the Loud House (one of my favourite shows growing up  it is still running by the way)  something clicked in me. I am lonely. I feel lonely. I feel like I am sitting in a crowd but I'm alone. Maybe I deserve this feeling. Being a lonely man in a lively world. I loved that show not because it was funny or because the characters were nice or anything  it was just because the characters had each other. When I see them hugging each other  I felt like I want that  being wanted by my family  or anyone really. When I see the main character and his best friend  I envy that  I want to have a best friend that I can count on too  and he can count on me. I really wanted that.

But I suppose we can't have everything we want in life. So  I suppose that is my story. Thanks for reading  and I hope you have a wonderful day or night wherever you may be. And I am sorry if my call for deliverance is a tad bit too long  and a tad bit too shallow  I don't know where to go.",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1jitl4s/cartoons_are_nice/
loneliness,Realizations of the World ,"Over the years I've realized what a fake artificial world we live in. Most people that are in your life will only be seasonal and going out of your way for them is meaningless. Many who were once your friends will become simply acquaintances or _random people you once knew_ 

And with many people just being in contact with them once or twice a year is an achievement in itself. Meeting up or regular texting and calls is simply a utopian pie in the sky. 

And as people get older people lose their innocence and peoples main goal in life is their survival and their self interest. Peoples friendships start revolving around status  who has the better job  who has a high position  who has x number of cars  vacations or properties. It's a never ending cycle of competition and superficiality. This makes people grow further apart and become lonelier.

loneliness,Bad day for realize I have no Real Friends.,"Today I turn 34  12 am... a little summary of me is that I am 4 subjects away from finishing university  I am already developing a prof thesis  I feel old and bad for continuing there but I swear that the path has been the most complex and painfull that I walked ever. 

Over time I noticed that I met many people and enjoyed their company  I attended parties and occasional events but for some reason I always felt alone  over time my acquaintances left their respective areas of study at the university and continued their lives. Well... Today I wanted to invite someone to an event the following Saturday and I was faced with the reality that I have no friends  not a single one. little by little as I erase numbers of people who have never sent me a single message in periods of 10 to 15 years... not a single call. 

Others who no longer had the same number or people who were not friends at all. 

I bought 2 tickets for an art and electronic music event at a bar that I will probably attend alone. There are no girls either. Not one that I can invite since of the 5 with which I have contact. 5 rejected the invitation. 

friendless. loveless.

You know  in the afternoon  I will attend a family meal with my parents and my two brothers. I'm sure they don't know how much it means to me to at least have them. I'll be sure to tell them. The family is that web that sometimes doesn't let you fall. In Mexico we have a lot of culture of family and friends but little by little the internet has corrupted that too. little by little there are more people watching their cell phones scrolling empty and meaningless applications when they are right next to those they love and we are so temporary. so fragile that in a second an illness would cause your loved one to be gone. 

And you spent time watching a Tik Tok or a Story of someone else's achievements while you feel miserable and curious... that other someone is somehow also unhappy with his life.

 I hate this Matrix. this kind of alternate reality where we all seem to always be so alone.

I try to hope that at least tomorrow it won't be like that  I no longer hold my cell phone in restaurants or in parks or benches even if I have plenty of time. I leave that for other places or times.

[Because it sucks to feel alone.]

It hurts even more to be alone  sometimes I heard that friends are that family that one chooses. 

But it seems no matter how hard I try  when I choose to give my friendship. It seems like I only offer garbage.

It seems that I have to accept for now that 
there is no love as a couple 
and there is no friendship. 
But I have faith.

Tomorrow can always be different. No?

At least if I die alone  I'll say I tried.

Hugs to all.

Fck the defeat.",10,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1gj8zqb/bad_day_for_realize_i_have_no_real_friends/
loneliness,21  is the best already over?,"I 21 (M) am going through what I can only think to consider is a crisis currently. I’m a workaholic to keep things brief  I’ve been working seven days a week for roughly the last year and a half now. Obviously there are exceptions I’ve been sick or just called out for mental breaks  but pretty much nonstop. I’m an auto tech for my primary job  which I’ll also add where I’m paid flat-rate which means I only get paid for the labor I produce  and if the work isn’t there or it’s (bad) work my pay can be extremely inconsistent at times. I work at Walmart on Sundays for my second job which I consider easy guaranteed income. I have been putting myself through this to attempt to pay off my student debt roughly ~$50k still  which I can’t even claim anything for because I’m an engineering dropout. My whole life is work  I get up  go to work  come home  too tired to do much else  eat  sleep  repeat. I have some friends that I keep very loose touch with and really only have one friend I talk to almost daily. I’ve had two really rough intimate relationships over the last couple of years. My first girlfriend was manipulative and then dropped me out of nowhere  my second was a much better person overall that I honestly connected a lot more with  but there was a lot of toxicity I caught on from my first relationship so I ended it roughly two months in (I still work with her mom in my department at Walmart and she still works at Walmart). Both relationships I know deeply affected me in that I am extremely unwilling to talk to people around me now. I started talking to another girl in my department at Walmart surprisingly. But that ended fast  she basically just stopped talking to me and then I found out from someone else that she basically found someone else she was more interested in. I called her out on feeling like she led me on  and said basically just told her how inconsiderate it is of her to just drop me like that with no warning and then expect me to want to be her friend (she said she wanted to stay friends). Guess how that went and how awkward it is talking to her now when I have to. I know it’s a skewed perception of the world but I’m stuck in a mindset of everyone is out to get you and or will disappoint you. I’m self-aware enough to understand I’m not completely alone and there are other people with experiences just like me or even worse  but I can’t get out of my own head. I feel like I’ve just shut down and can’t do it anymore. I find myself longing to be social and then I have the opportunities and I either don’t take the chances or because of my inner negativity I feel I push away the people around me. This is what pushes me to put so much into work as well because it’s almost like an escape to me  but now that’s catching up and I’m really burnt out of that too and just lately been all around miserable. I watch and read about self-improvement and like I said I’m self-aware about of lot of issues I’m struggling with and kinda understand the reasons why I am the way I am and feel but I can’t get out of it. Has anyone else felt like this and got out of it. I feel like some people around me are living life in just like a whole other universe compared to how I feel on a daily basis and lately it’s just making everything feel meaningless and unfulfilling. I’m posting this mostly to vent  but any suggestions or feedback is greatly appreciated.

loneliness,I can't even lie I'm lonely as F.,"So... How do you even begin such a thread? I'm 31  male  from Poland. I'm neurodivergent  depressed and have anxiety disorder (taking meds for this). I have a pretty good paying (but dead-endish) job  have my interests and hobbies. Love reading  music and other things. All my life I felt permeating loneliness and a feeling of difference from people both my age  older and younger... I can hold a conversation  but other people baffle me with things they actually care about. Especially younger people  who seem not even interested in talking to eachother  let alone me (in work etc). 

Being neurodivergent  but not diagnosed what exactly I ""have""  my Interests are pretty weird I admit  I play bass  guitar  some piano  can sing pretty good  love weird and old music  but can listen and appreciate normie music too. I love reading  making some kick ass coffee (v60  flair espresso etc)  have very good manual skills (I'm currently building a 3d printer of my own design from scratch  have built a bass guitar only using hand tools  can do home renovations etc  actually can do amazing massages too  since that's one of my Interests and I have read a few books/practiced a lot). I exercise - calisthenics and free weights  eat well (when I eat... Since my appetite fluctuates with depression episodes)  take care of myself  have a pretty good body imo (and my exes opinion too :p) except for my face... Which I feel is unattractive  as in not in the canon of beauty (big nose  no too prominent jaw and cheekbones) 

I had one serious partner. It was a love which was coming from both of us  she loved me and I loved her. The chemistry was amazing  sex was simply indescribably good. It was perfect. She was the most beautiful woman I have ever laid my eyes upon..Welp... Turned out she was married. We were ""together"" for six years. She also was suffering from depression  and She had laid off her meds  proclaimed that She wants to be pregna t with her husband. I was speechless. Maybe I'm dumb  but I still love her  despite this  and I doubt I can ever forget her embrace. She wanted to keep being together somehow  but for the good of her child I backed out. I want her to be happy  her child and husband to be happy too. For them to be complete... I took the hit on me completely it seems since when I check her FB page she seems to be happy. Since the break my depression evolved into actual wishing to die and self harm  poisoning myself  hating myself... I tried to take my life on multiple occasions. My mother took me to therapy  but after four different attempts with different specialists  no help could be found.

I actually feel like my death is imminent. My heart physically hurts  but I wont resist if I get a heart attack. During one of my attempts I took 2k mg dph and all of my antidepresants (hundreds od pills of duloxetine) but I'm still there somehow. 

Now I feel that all I do is wake up  go to work and try to talk with some people I think are as weird as I am  then go to sleep after work. Life is pretty much meaningless. I have a Tinder account with no matches (yes  I am dumb enough to actually pay for premium  boosts  superlikes etc) despite actually having pretty good photos considering my looks and having a good bio there  being nice and sincere with others... I don't understand it. My iq is 139 and my diagnosis is simple - I'm ugly. Personality  your status  heck even cock size dont matter at all when you are ugly. That's all she wrote and we can deceive ourselves if so we choose. So... Yeah I'm pretty sure that's what is on my mind right now.

Actually  I was texting a girl I know  we had good chemistry and all but got ghosted. Wtf is with peoples manners nowadays? I thought everything was good  but I was mistaken once again.

All I wish for right now is love  you know? I don't even mean sex  despite really liking making love and allegedly being really good at it (which I suspect was the reason Alice was with me  a weirdo  for so long?) but right now all I want is to love and be loved in return  like souls love eachother  care for eachother... Try to keep each other warm during this storm called life... But I feel like that's just past me. I'm done with it  but not from my choice. People call men like me ""incels"" I learn... I don't have anything in common with those men  but I do understand their loneliness  feelings of being an alien. In a way  I get the anger too  but I am not angry at women  I actually really care and am courteous even when I'm rejected. But... I just don't know what to say... Why even say anything. Don't you understand? I bet you do  since you are here. I want to talk with someone  I want to build a future for my wife  my kids. I cant do it goddammit :( I actually watch porn to see women smile and stuff since I can't make anyone smile in this way... It's really pathetic and I want to die thinking about that.

Yes... All that wall of text was written while crying  after work and laying in bath. I'm gonna clean myself up and get to bed I think  but if you wanna talk... Please talk to me (quoting Joni Mitchell)",6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1gfo50p/i_cant_even_lie_im_lonely_as_f/
loneliness,It doesn't make sense,"I don't understand how it's possible for me to be so incompatible with everyone around me. All the things that matter to me are seen as a joke or some type of outlandish imagination by the people around me. I'm 30 and I've literally never had a real friend  never been in a relationship  never had any sense of community. It's always just been meaningless casual companionship or nothing at all. I spent the last 15 years trying everything I could come up with to seek people I could form bonds with and it did absolutely nothing. I've had hundreds of people tell me to commit suicide because of my views about ontology and economics and human lifestyles  I've had thousands more call me crazy and ghost me for similar reasons  and many more who just refuse to even acknowledge anything at all and seem like they aren't even alive. What is going on? I know the cliche says I will have to consider that I'm the problem but the issue with that is that the more I improve myself  rhe worse this gets. The better I am  the more alienated I get from everyone else. And sure I think it's stupid  I shouldn't need to feel connected to people  but I'm still an irrational person like everyone and I can't help it. I'm pretty sure I cannot handle it much longer before it kills me. Also I have already been in therapy for over 12 years with a variety of different people. It's not relevant because the issue I'm facing is not internal  it's incompatibility. It doesn't make me wrong to be incompatible with others  and I have spent YEARS working to improve myself.

So... I guess that's all. What the hell is actually going on. I don't know how many more days I can keep doing this life that is unreasonable and has no purpose whatsoever. Humans have turned life into a NIGHTMARE. ",6,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1ca6laa/it_doesnt_make_sense/
loneliness,I can do what other people do but without an audience it all feels meaningless,"On dating profiles  I often see people cite their hobbies and interests. I think I've gotten to a state of loneliness and meaningless that I don't even find mentioning such things important.



It's because when you are lonely  you realize that you have no audience for the things you do. What does it matter **to me** if I read a book  play a sport  travel  become better at something. It really doesn't matter to  me once I know it only impacts me. I feel someone who is truly lonely understands this.



And so I feel the only thing that becomes important really is our perspective  our health  our ability to survive  and how much we want to be there for the people we love. And I find that hobbies and interests do not have any impact on the things I just mentioned. Our perspectives are morphed by our loneliness or lack of loneliness  and the amount of awareness we are born with. And one could say that even our loneliness is something we are born into. But to conclude  it's really difficult to find people with this perspective in life. And so it makes me feel even more lonely.",7,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1f4adi8/i_can_do_what_other_people_do_but_without_an/
loneliness,How to meet new people with severe trust issues?,"I Can't figure out why friends betray and abandon me. I had a close friend group of 2 in school and got replaced by someone else.
Met 3 people when i used to go to a private tutoring class but then we just didn't get along  met other pre-meds there but when i offered them to go to a cafe during the break they started acting weird and i immediatly recognized that they didn't want to go there WITH me and then i watched them disappear into crowd  like literally they left me in the middle of the street.
Went on a trip with my 2 bffs and their friends. We got bored and started playing Never have i ever. Me and bff were the only ones left in the end and she pointed out  my biggest insecurity. She said i have never had Acne when in fact her skin was also not quite clear. My other bff gasped. i told her that if she wanted to play games like that then let it be and replied with ""i've never been overweight"" she didn't seem upset at that moment but now doesnt talk to me. I felt a bit betrayed because she knew damn well that i've had acne for years and it has affected me so much that sometimes i would not go outside. Even though my skin is in a better condition it used to be so bad in the past. I don't care what others think of me or if they make fun of me but my bff was not the person who should have mentioned my flaw in front of others. This completely worsened my already existing trust issues. I finally felt comfortable with sharing my weaknesses with close friends but she used it against me just to win a meaningless game.
Other BFF is the only person on whom i can rely. We've been friends for like 14 years and i'm thankful that i have her in my life but i also want to have other friends but for some reason  friendships just don't work out for me. Something is wrong with my personality i sometimes seem too cold and distant but i have never betrayed others. I've been told by my old co-workers that i seem comforting and trustful. I worked quite alot to improve my appearance. I always try to look my best but now instead of being more approachable i seem more intimidating because one can tell that i pay too much attention to my physical appearance.

loneliness,The one girl who was taken away she cannot be replaced even thousands of them comes along ,"Have you guys met a girl who was so special that even thousand others took her place but still your heart will scream for her. Life is so cruel wherever I go i wished she was with me and my soul calls her every moment of my life even when I'm not thinking about her. People might call me crazy but i never even saw her face properly I don't even know never met her. So let me tell you how we met. We met on Omegle and before i could know i was madly in love with her. I used to tell her i wasn't but I loved her more than anything in this world I did. Somedays i don't think about her at all. But lately i miss her so much. Maybe it was my mistake I couldn't meet her in real life or promise her that I would meet her but i surely promised her it would happen one day. But it wasn't her fault she chose not to wait. It was the most beautiful moment of my life when she said she wants to have my babies. She was the only girl I met who wanted to dream about a life with me. She had a dead sister I prayed to her that she brings her back to me. I loved her so much that whenever i go out i felt that not having her beside me and not seeing her face every second of my life. My life is not worth living. She is the one girl who could bring tears to my eyes when someone asked about her 50 years down the line. I wished it didn't get ugly between us towards the end where she would call me a creep for contacting her even after she blocked me. How am I the creep for trying to talk to the girl who promised me she would get married to me and have my kids. I don't have the energy to love again or take the hurt of loving again. I wished i could hallucinate so that maybe her ghosts would appear infront of me. I know she will never come back even if I call her name a million times. People call me stupid for becoming an alcoholic just because of her. But i wished i was drunk all the time so the pain is numb forever. I'm very close to becoming an addict maybe this is the another battle of my life where i have to fight it with everything i have. She was the only one who wanted me to stop smoking because she didn't want me die before her. How can someone say these words and then act as a complete stranger?. She was the only one who didn't want to go to sleep even after talking for 12 hours. She was the only one who asked me to stay home skipping work because she wanted to spend time with me. Feels like God played a sick joke with me by taking me away from her else I'm paying for my sins. Maybe I'm writing all these stuff is literally meaningless she may even fail to recognise me even if we bump into each other that's a one in a million chances. She's gone forever and i have to live with that pain till i die. My last wish would be to see her face on my deathbed and hold her hands and tell her ""I'm sorry i wished i was there when you called me and i wished i could go back in time and spend every second of my life with you that was just wasted in your absence"". I swear on everything i hold sacred in my life i will never tell a woman that i love her until i find someone like her. Because she took over every part of my being when she met me. I couldn't even feel sad for my parents who are suffering due to my alcoholism. My relationship with my mother is almost ruined and with my dad it's barely surviving. For some reason even before her I knew i was destined to be alone forever. I wished i could start a new life with killing and erasing everything from my past. I hope the God gives me that chance. Still my stupid heart will always pray that we bump into each other one day and pick up where we left. I will love you forever. Her birthday is on August 1st. I wanted to wish her on her birthday. Sadly I can't even do that. ",3,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1c5agxl/the_one_girl_who_was_taken_away_she_cannot_be/

I dont like meaningless friendship for me i need to have natural connect like u get me or i get u otherwise it just feels forced & fake. I tried to be there for other but no one recioprcates people just take take take don't give. I go out of my way to do things even if i have nothing in common with you so we can even have bare minimum level friendship but ppl i approach don't care .

Basically i can give everything they want & they still don't care about being friends with me.Plus i have some accent left so they can sense or hear it i m not quite from here it which make things difficult for me ranging from asking uncomfortable questions to being racist  to just leaving the party the minute they hear my accent. I understand i m in no condition to do even basic hygienic things like brushing & shower due to my untreated mental health issues nor i have doctor or money to afford ongoing therapy so idk how to get better i have absolutely no one who gets me 0 nothing nada.

I m very introvert so idc for outdoorsy stuff. I just play games which nowadays are so boring  i collect build lego funko action figure  very very few select tv shows or movie i watch on repeat i dont much care for new content. You may think it must be so easy to find friend on meet up or app cuz of interest i have but u ll be surprised its Not ppl r brutaley toxic  judgemental  competitive   ruthlesss. When i was kid most ""friends"" were just using me but even them atleast they played with me whether its board games or going out playing socce it felt real & natural. That idk how to explain but that feelings doesnt exist but i have given up on meaningful friendship but there is part of me craves it so desperately. I m messed up both internally & externally for life. Mental health is like slow torture death sentence. World is so ruined by brute mentality that in hidden manner still rules the world. If anyone here shares what i shared feel free to msg me or interested in friendship even if u dont share things in conmon want to be friend you can msg too.

loneliness,I feel so tired. Is this how my life is going to be?,"Is it always going to be like this?


I'm 22. I recently lost my parent in a really traumatic way. I miss them so much. They were the only person who ever cared about me in my entire life. I feel their absence everyday. I see the things they left behind and cry every day. I remember how everything happened. I can't get those images out of my mind. I'm completely alone now.

I'm just so lonely. I'm extremely boring and because of that when people get to know me they just slowly stop hanging out with me. I live alone. I don't have parents. No one likes me. I can't change my personality.

It's been like that since always. I have 0 friends. I never had a single friend in my entire life  even in my childhood I never had a friend. 

After losing my parent. I recently moved to this new place. People used to sympathize with me at start and used to talk to me.

 I used to hang out with these people. I tried really hard to socialize with them. But after knowing that how boring i'm  they've Started to exclude me now. They hang out without me now. They used to call me outside but not anymore. I don't want to insert myself in a group where i'm not wanted or needed. I feel like they have more fun without me.

I hear the sounds of their laughter and talking while I'm inside feeling lonely  crying and missing my dead parent. They know i'm alone inside alone they just don't care.

The cherry on top is that i'm poor too. I don't have any money. I can't do anything even if i want to. I literally don't have money for it. I'm barely getting by.

Everyone has a family around me. I hear them talk. I feel so jealous. Everyone has someone they can talk to  someone who cares about them. 

I have no one  literally no one who cares about me. It's been days since i last talked to someone and the last time i talked to someone was when i was buying groceries  yeah it was the cashier. Lol. Oh and i live in a third world country  did i mention that.

I don't feel like eating. I don't want to do anything. I don't want to get up every morning to do nothing all day. 
I want someone to care about me. I want to care about someone. I want someone to talk to. I go outside but nothing ever happens. I'm so uninteresting that no one wants to know me and when they get to know me they just leave. I want to stop crying. It physically hurts now.

Anyway if anyone read this till now  thank you so much.

loneliness,Is it my fault?,"Lately  ive been feeling lonely alot i think for the past 2 years now. It’s annoying to say the least but sometimes I can’t help but think It’s my fault like i should be doing something better  reaching out to people better  connecting with God better trying to think positive things and all. But im exhausted really. I still feel lonely with friends  have been trying to reconnect to God  and try to reach out the best i can( ik my best is not enough but life has been v difficult since the last 5 years and i really am trying my best lol i just wish things would just end now like my shit life and all like ive lost everything i cared so much about and cant bear losing more but still i keep failing qnd yes i am self aware enough to know that lm in a rut and its very difficult to escape).

loneliness,I tired of living and I fucked up with my friend,I don't write or speak very well so I'll be frank. I can't seem to get out of bed everymorning and face the world. I've never really thought I'd be seeking emotional condolences like this but I don't really have anywhere else to turn to. I'm getting B's in 3 of my classes right not and I just erupted at a guy I barely even know. He's pretty well liked aswell. I just get so tired and frustrated at everything that I just start not caring about anything or anyone. My friend might be affected by my decision to tell this guy to go fuck himself and I hope he can forgive me. Honestly I really think I'm way too emotionally dependent on him sometimes I'm thinking I should take break. Problem being that I don't really have many other people I know that I feel comfortable talking to. I'm just so tired  and I keep on thinking I'm going to crash and just kill myself in April but I don't think I should do anything like that for the sake of my family and my 3 friends.,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1ikqa2w/i_tired_of_living_and_i_fucked_up_with_my_friend/

loneliness,I just feel like I don't have anything.,"I can't pinpoint when exactly this feeling started  mostly because it feels as if it has always been there one way or another. So long my one and only dream was to form connections with people  and i managed to find one. But unfortunately that one made me be more aware of how hard it is to find friendships like that in the world that was unfolding in front of me. She has gone on to continue living her life  meeting new people despite her own struggles  forming strong friendships and everything. We are still friends  and i love her so much  but everytime i think about her i cant help but feel even more worthless. I feel stuck in this same spot i was way back since i met her  wanting to continue making connections but just being incapable of doing so. And that's the exact same way i have felt about everyone i met since then.

I became obsessed with being cared for  in any way that i could. Even if it meant causing problems  even if it meant staging situations where i was the victim  i just wanted to seem vulnerable enough where someone could try to comfort me about it  care for me. I thrive off of that feeling. I also thrive off of the feeling of helping  because it makes me feel as if i'm doing something that can get them to care about me. Unfortunately you can't do much with both contradicting desires becoming a mess and colliding with each other to ruin every relationship you try to form. And it has happened so much now. 

I have tried taking solace in romantic relationships  in getting with people to provide me with the feeling that i'm necessary to at least one person  that i'm loved  and all of those relationships have failed in such short spans of time because i'm impossible to deal with. I'm dramatic  i'm depressing to be around  i enjoy provoking reactions of any kind (even if negative) out of the people im supposed to love just because i enjoy watching it. There comes a point where they stop wanting to put up with it and decide to leave me  and that's the one time where i realize that i never wanted to cause problems  that my impulses led me to making drama out of everything that could have been talked through  and once they leave i can't blame anyone for it but me. 

Recently had a break-up that stemmed from this behavior  with a person who was about to start a relationship with someone else at the moment we broke up  and it has just made me be so much more aware of the shit i have been doing for years now. It's a person i still have to talk to since they are a member of one of my only two friend groups  and i'm completely incapable of getting closure simply by cutting contact and going our separate ways  which is the only way i have been able to get through situations like this. And i still have to hear about their relationship  which just makes everything worse for me. But i can't blame them since i was the one who ruined it all  even if i still do feel so unimaginably mad at everyone involved. Especially at them  since their reasoning was to ""stop me from getting stressed out"". I can't accept that the decision to do it stemmed from them not wanting to feel like a bad person for suddenly putting me in that situation and being the good guy for it. I'm extremely frustrated at them for that and just their general behavior  but i still have to put up with it for the sake of keeping friends i can't even trust with anything i go through out of fear of being judged.

The problem is never not so much that i don't have people to talk to  because i do  even if there aren't many. The problem lies on the fact that i don't feel like i can trust them at all. I go into most conversations with them cautious of not saying something wrong  cautious of saying the right things for them to not get mad or mock me. And i have to do it this way because i'm so jealous of them all. People who mostly have it together  who have people they are close with and can trust  people who have figured out what they wanna do with their lives  people who have found romantic partners that can accompany them. At this point it just makes me feel so sick to think about. The same situation i have with my best friend in the world is there for every other relationship i managed to make since that point. I can't confide anything with people who already have it all. I feel like i'm getting laughed at  like everyone is watching me be bad at living. It feels so exhausting. 

What am i supposed to do when i can't even talk to someone about having a bad day? About the things that upset me? Why can't i do any of that if i'm supposed to be surrounded by people i can trust? I haven't brought myself to go on and vent like this to anyone in a while now. Not to anyone i actually have a relationship with anyways. Everyone else already has people they can talk to except for me. That's just the thing i think for absolutely everything i can think of. No one that can bring themselves to care about me  no one i can try to help. Failing at the two things that drive me forward. 

It seems so easy to die at this point. These past few years it has never seem more justified to think about it. It's all so pointless now. I have my university exam coming up in around two months. I'm supposed to be building up towards my future. But i'm so tired. I have lost all motivation. I don't know what the point is anymore. I have thought this at every point of my life  but it has never felt so true. Would it really be such a tragedy to lose me? I have spent so long convincing myself  but at this point i have been given the definitive answer. That it really hasn't ever been worth it. I can't think of anyone i know that doesn't have a replacement for my absence. I can't think of anyone that only has me. Of anyone who doesn't have a dozen other people they can look to. It would be merciful for me to die. I haven't brought anything to anyone. I haven't brought anything to myself. I just want to die so badly. I have absolutely nothing to continue living for. I feel like a corpse going with the motions of life. I just want to have peace of mind. I just want to rest. I'm tired. I'm sorry i have dragged this on for so long.",4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1ifo7l0/i_just_feel_like_i_dont_have_anything/
loneliness,This is just too much,"I've been browsing the internet for a couple of hours now. Aimlessly scrolling through posts  videos  GIFs and memes. I've been doing this for a substantial amount of time during these past few months but it has gotten way out of hand during the holidays. God. I hate the holidays.

Anyway.. I don't really know where to start. My loneliness is killing me so I guess posting here seems like a good idea. I don't know if my rambling will end up in a question or conclusion. We'll see I guess.

I was bullied at school and as such my school years were horrible. I was the fat  nerdy kid. I kept only two friends from school. One is just as socially inept as I am and in a long term committed relationship and the other works abroad. So I don't see them often. 

Then came university. I studied in another city  about a 7 hours drive from my hometown. Med school was brutal. I made some friends  lost some weight but I was hit with a major depressive episode and I got derrailed because of it. My grades took a hit  I lost friends and my university years were also painted black. I still can't visit that city because of the terrible memories I have. I was actively suicidal  I was admitted for a failed attempt and I was diagnosed with a mix of GAD  major depression and OCD. I was a severe hypochondriac  I thought I had every disease under the sun and I did not believe my negative blood and imaging tests (Yes  I even had 2 brain MRIs because I was conviced I had a CNS degerative disease. I did not believe the negative results. It's unreal just talking about it.). I am still battling with this and things have stabilized I guess. I am far from happy. I think I'll never be happy but at least there are times where I don't actively wish to be dead. I would prefer not existing in the first place but I am not actively wishing for death. I mean that has to count for something. Medications have had some effect I guess. After completing med school  most of my Uni-friends stayed behind to begin residency. I couldn't spend another day there so I left and returned home. As a result  I lost contact with all of those friends. 

Following med school I started residency in my hometown. Residency was brutal and then COVID came which made things even worse. I met a girl during residency  we sort of hit it off and we started dating. She was not my first relationship. I had a couple of girlfriends in the past but things didn't work out. Me breaking up with my first GF (I think she cheated on me and then dumped me by phone- I say think because that's what I've heared from hearsay but I wasn't able to verify it)  I think was the catalyst that ushered me into my first major depressive episode back in Uni. Anyway  I met this girl during residency and after a year we moved in togethers. Things were fine I guess. I loved her but after a while things fizzled out. Life got in the way  she got used to me  I got used to her. The classic stuff. We were unhappy  our sex life was miserable  we argued a lot and she started pushing for a kid. She presented me with an ultimatum (either we break up or we have a kid) so I packed my things and left. That was 4 months ago. 

Ever since then I've been alone. I rarely talk to people  I don't feel like I have anyone near me. There are times when the silence is just too much and I can't stand listening to it. I go to work and try to study and work on my phD. Work therapy can only help so much.

I gave up the few hobbies I had. I used to play guitar and do magic tricks with cards. Those are all gone. I just wake up  work and return home to either scroll endlessly on the phone or play PS5. 

I occasionaly see pictures of acquitanses and friends in friend groups with many people and I can't feel anything but jealousy. I think I've missed on so much. I'm pushing 33 and I don't have a close group of friends. I have a few friends scattered here and there but nothing else. Apart from my immediate family (mother  father and brother) 2 people called me or texted me for merry X-mas. 

I feel that I missed on everything. School was a nightmare because of the bullying. University was a nightmare because of a major depressive episode that ruined everything. Residency is a nightmare across the board for all medical professionals- depressed or not. I feel like I have no one to turn to and I am starting to feel so very tired. I am tired of feeling worthless and alone. Maybe I deserve it. Who knows.   ",5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1hmrps7/this_is_just_too_much/
loneliness,Alone,"Hi! I need to share. For several years now  I have been tormented  tormented by the question that I am apparently not destined to be loved. 
For many years  I thought only about earning money. We did not live very richly and from the age of 12 I washed floors to earn money. I had goals and I worked and studied a lot. I was never particularly romantic  but I always had such a thing that I would have a partner ... and now I am 36 years old 

I am completely alone. Total loneliness  there are days and weeks when I do not utter a word 

And I do not understand how this happened 

At school  a guy started courting me  we went for a walk with him and had a great time  but he did not want anyone to know about it and never asked me out again.  Also at school  a boy started courting me and stopped  although I responded to him
At the institute  there was not a single manifestation of male interest in my direction
My friends dated guys  and I did everything alone

I am a very sociable person. Talking to someone is not a problem. I am smiling  cheerful  active  by general opinion and my surprise  I am beautiful  but there is no interest in me and everyone with whom I start talking  they are all my friends in the end  and I am a friend to them too  but not a lover.
I don't sit at home. Exhibitions  bars  clubs of interest  various concerts. I am active. I like to be at home  but I decided that I need to be more active. After all  it is easier to get to know him in society... 

There was also Tinder  but there were a lot of matches and practically 0 communication. They started talking to me  and then just blocked me. You understand that I decided that apparently I can't keep up a conversation  but my problem is that my work is connected with communication and lecturing and there can be no problems in this. I asked my friends for feedback about myself and everyone said that I was interesting. 
I worked on my appearance  just a little  again zero result. 
And then there was a breakthrough  a man liked me  but he (according to him) was sure that I was ready to jump on him and we would just fuck 
But I didn't like him at all  and he almost stalked me.  I can't describe how hard I tried to get rid of him  but I managed to get him to understand that I didn't like him and wasn't interested in him.
After that  I went to celebrate Christmas in the Dominican Republic and there a dark-skinned hotel employee tried to rape me  but he was scared off by a crowd of people passing by. He was drunk by the way
I was scared  but since he didn't have time to do anything  I quickly got over it.
With my friends  we went to a club to dance. A guy came up to me and said that he wanted to fuck me  but he was very drunk...
Understand me correctly  I'm not a prude  I understand the importance of sex  but apart from an offer or attempts at violence  there was nothing...
And then I fell in love... I fell in love to the point of losing consciousness. He was such a cool man. Young  handsome  English  an engineer by profession
We started to communicate a lot. I fell in love  but he didn't... not at all. One day  casually  although in fact it was a plan  I invited him to a cafe.  We had a great conversation  we had a lot in common... then I invited him under the guise that my friends gave me tickets to a stand up. He refused. There was nothing between us except dinner and incredibly interesting conversation. In the end  I told him that I liked him  he told me (who will guess?) correctly  he sent me...
Then I went to South Korea. And then I became even more disappointed in myself and in men. Here one old man saw me riding a bicycle and shouted ""whore"" at me  and then there was a case when a man approached me and began to offer to fuck him for $50 and said that I was a prostitute... (I wonder if that's a lot or a little for sex?😅🥲) 

Then there was a similar case in Macau. I stayed in a decent hotel and at about 9 pm (and this is a city where life is always in full swing  so it's not even evening) I went out to 7-eleven. Some old man began to shout something at me in Chinese and then came right up to me and invited me to the room for money with the help of a translator. I ran away 

I want to explain something else  I myself was the initiator of communication several times  but in the end nothing happened.  I'm not sitting and waiting for a prince  but now I'm tired  I can't take it anymore  I'm 36 years old and I've never done sauce  I've never known what a gift from a man is. No one has looked after me  helped me  or cared about how or what.
I want to take care of my loved one myself  I want to be a good friend  partner and loved one. There's so much unspent love in me... I just want to hug him and be gentle  listen to his stories and tell him mine.

They tell me that I have high demands... My demands are simple  to love me and give him your care and that's it. We'll figure it out with the bot  we'll share interests  we'll give each other time to do our own things  hobbies  etc.

The bottom line is: no one needs me
I can't do this anymore  I want a relationship and sex  preferably with the same person  but apparently that's too much. I'm tired  I'm just tired.  If God exists  then he's clearly making fun of me
I fucking went to fortune tellers... and they all say it will happen soon  but it just won't happen soon. They're liars... I'm hysterical
I don't understand what's wrong with me that makes me seem like a slut. I just don't want to post my photos here  but I'm overweight  I dress very simply  usually jeans and oversized. If I wear a skirt  it's long  nothing tight anywhere. I don't wear makeup  except for eyelashes and pink lip gloss... I don't understand why people perceive me this way...

I feel bad from loneliness

loneliness,i'm sorry,Hi. So I have never really done this before. And um  I'm just really nervous to talk about it now but I think I'm ready. I have always been alone and it's been really hard for me. To go cope up with everything. My depression is just blocking me out to try and explore new things like participating in social activities.  But I feel like there are groups everywhere  and I can never belong anywhere. For the longest time I used to just live in delusion and used to think that I had friends. But the only person who thought we were friends was me. And it's always been like that. I have never been able to make any friends  mostly because I'm weird  ill admit that. I used to get bullied in school for having low grades and for being ugly (I genuinely am). I never really got good grades but I'm trying. My family especially my father he is very abusive and hits my mom and my brother. Really bad. And I try to stay out of it but I'm also dragged in it sometimes. My bruises are always somehwere on my face and I don't know how to cover it. Whenever my teachers notice the scars they say things like 'you must've done something bad that's why he hits you'. And some don't even bother asking. Since the past 4 years my father and brother live somehwere else  good thing. But the verbal abuse is still on going. No one really cares about me  ever. Even my mother shut me out because she couldn't bear it anymore. My ex long distance best friend is spreading rumours about me with her friends   and honestly she was the only best thing that will ever happen to me. We were really close a few years ago for 6 months and then they shifted someplace else. I always missed her. And I always will. I tried apologising for everything to her but she wouldn't listen and would pretend that everything was fine  I tried to look out for her and support her but she only cares about her other bestie now. Her brother(he is my age). He held out a hand to me for help. And he comforted me  but I think he is tired of me now. I understand that because he has responsibilities. He has priorities. We fell for each other. We really did. We still love each other but I think he is in pain because of me. When his sister found out about us she went ballistic and told on him to his mom  literally everyone. So he's a bit upset about that. And he's a really amazing guy and girls at school have a crush on him  ( including his sister's current best friends which is okay because he told me to not worry about them. But he's being called a playboy  I think his intensions are pure  so it hurt him. I am giving him a break  he needs it. So yea  and my brother was sent to a mental asylum when he was 13? Everyone at school and in my society called me a mad person  and said I would end up just like him  fast forward now  I think so too. He tried to kill himself multiple times. He tried jumping out of the window so many times  he was really hanging himself but thankfully he was saved later. My brother hates me for not letting him go of his hand that day  but he really jumped out. There is just a lot more  and now I feel like killing myself  there is no point in living  but I don't want to let go at the same time. ,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1h2npwi/im_sorry/
loneliness,Mind is a broken glass,"I'm a 34 year old guy. I live in Hungary  Europe. English is not my native language  but I'll try my best to get across my story.

My wife sleeps next to me. It's 10:36PM here  It's late  I'm tired  but still I fear sleeping. Why?

Because every single time I go to bed and try to take nap or an all night's sleep  my mood gets a complete reset. Let me explain:

I've been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) + Bipolar Disorder (BD) around 8 years ago  spending several months at a special hospital treating BPD. Even back then I've noticed how my mood changed drastically after sleep. 

I know  you might be thinking ""but this guy has a wife! She must have plenty of talks  attention  sexy time on his hands!"" - no way he's lonely! No  dear reader  sorry  but no  this is not so simple. Ever since the start with my wife  it's been a horrible ride  mostly because of my extremely low self-esteem  my general inexperience with women  and my jealousy towards my future wife. 

After a pretty sad and lonely upbringing  I ended up being even more lonelier: I was a complete outsider at age 18yo  instantly leaving the school and ending up at manual labour  supporting my family. 

Thinking back  I literally had zero goals  zero hopes towards the future  I was dreaming about ending it all since I was a young kid  constantly abused. 

Now I've reached the 8 year mark with my wife (only married since August last year  but been together for 8 years)  and I have to finally arrive at the sad conclusion that my soul  with all my past sins  all my past wrongdoings  all the hurt  the pain I've caused and every. Single. Moment. I've hated in my life  that just can't be fixed by anyone! 

After years of therapy  years of seeking and taking professional help  doctor after doctor  advise (and meds) after another there's no fixin' a soul which is completely and utterly broken. 

You CAN feel lonely if you're stuck in your past and you can't move on! 

First  you have to love yourself. That's something I just can't do. I've caused the divorce of my parents  then I've caused even more pain for years while I was an alcoholic.

Even though I've been sober for almost 6 months now and not even thinking about breaking the habit now  it's just hard when I feel like slipping away mentally. 

My mental health is rapidly declining  and nobody cares  most people around me are just upset  like why I bother them with my negativity? 

While I suffer. Man  how I wish I could forget the past! How I wish I could forgive that little kid that was me for his weakness! For not defending himself back then! 

I might have a wife now  but I live in fear of losing her. I wish I could just appreciate the present and move past... The past. 

One thing I know for sure by now is that there won't be any outside help. I either defeat my mental illnesses quickly or I'll end up losing everything.

loneliness,I don’t know what I’m doing wrong,"I feel like I’m destined to be alone. It doesn’t matter how hard I try  no one sticks around. I have no one in my life- no one to talk to  no one to laugh with. My phone is so dry  I don’t know why I bother having one. I don’t know what’s so awful about me that means that nobody wants to even be associated with me. 

I’m aware that if you look at my profile and the posts that are on there  I come across as an unhappy and miserable person  but I’m not always like that. I use Reddit to try and express my emotions in a healthy way because I have no one to talk to. When I’m having general conversations with people  I’m much more upbeat. I try my best to take an interest and ask questions to keep the conversation going. I’m always polite  and especially when messaging someone  I’m never pushy about getting a reply. I try to treat the person I’m talking to the way I wish someone would treat me. 

I can’t seem to even keep internet friends. I met someone on this subreddit and we started talking when they sent me a message after seeing one of my posts. We instantly hit it off and really related to one another. I finally felt understood by someone. We talked for almost a year  then suddenly  they stopped talking to me. I hadn’t said anything that was rude or upsetting- we were just in the middle of a conversation. I tried contacting them on Reddit  discord  even their phone number they had given me  but it’s as if they’d vanished. I understand that people have things going on in their lives  but I thought they cared enough about me to have at least said something  even if it was that they didn’t want to be friends anymore. 

There was someone else who I met online that I also seemed to click with. Again  I spent hours talking to them  and really put the effort in  only for them to stop replying a couple of months back. I just wish people wouldn’t get my hopes up. They even said how much they were looking forward to getting to know me better  and that they enjoyed talking to me. I don’t like when people say things like that when they clearly don’t mean it  because it really messes with my head. I know I have to keep putting myself out there to give myself a fighting chance to meet new people  but there’s only so much I can take. The whole process is draining. I don’t want to miss an opportunity due to past experiences not being great  but I don’t want to spend so much time on someone again if they’re just going to ghost me. 

I feel so unwanted and insignificant. I just want to be important to someone  to be wanted  for someone to care so much that they would miss me if I wasn’t around. If I disappeared right now  no one would probably notice  let alone be bothered. I have so much love and time to give to someone  but no one wants anything to do with me. Every night I go to bed wishing that one day I might find somebody else who feels the same. ",10,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1joc72n/i_dont_know_what_im_doing_wrong/
loneliness,I spend weeks without getting any messages from friends and family. If you do to  how do you cope with that? ,I am considered a very social person. I have always organised a lot of events for family and friends. But at one point  I got tired of it. So I have been stopping to see who would reach out to me. For the first of my life  it has been 3 months that I make the effort of not being the one to take the initiative and no one actually call me or reach out to me. I have many passions in my life and on top of my full time day job  I have many personal projects and I think most of the time  I cope really well on my own (I have a dog who makes it easier) but it still hurts to realise  that if I am not the one reaching out to others  nobody cares and nobody reach out to me. Seriously  if I died  it might take a few days before they find my body 😅. I didn't build a family and I am ok with that. But in this society  if you don't follow the path most people follow  it can get pretty lonely (because everyone is always so busy with their own lives). What about you? If you are in the same situation as I  how do you cope with that? ,17,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1hystv0/i_spend_weeks_without_getting_any_messages_from/
loneliness,3 am mental breakdown,It’s been a month since I’ve been in a very negative emotional state. I’m 15 and school feels so lonely. I always sit alone  and I’m constantly alone. The thing is I don’t think anyone in my family could even guess that this is how I spend all of my school days. I feel like I can’t be myself anywhere  that I don’t belong anywhere either. I always act happy when I’m around my family because I can’t bring myself to be vulnerable around them. But nobody gives a fuck about me or cares about how I’m doing. I lost a few friends since last year and grew apart some of them too. But it’s not the only reason of why I feel lonely. I feel lonely in my head  I feel lonely when I’m surrounded by people  I feel lonely when I’m having a good time. I can’t talk about how I feel to anyone I know because I know that they wouldn’t care or listen  or would just minimize my feelings or make fun of me. I don’t feel like I have anyone in my entourage who I feel comfortable with and close to . I do have friends who I talk to from time to time  but I don’t feel a real bond or connection to any of them. I lost a few friends like I said earlier  but even them didn’t care about me either  or were straight up toxic people. So I’ve been feeling very sad  and the fact that I don’t have anybody to talk about it or cheer me up makes me even sadder. I didn’t have school this week  classes where canceled. I spent all my days staying at home  with almost no notifications on my phone  no one to talk to even irl  with no motivation to do anything but lay down. During times like these  I start to hate my body and myself  and I disgust myself. I eat more because of sadness and stress  then cry because I feel so fat  but still can’t stop myself from eating so much. People don’t believe me when I say I hate myself and say they’d do anything to look like me  but they wouldn’t be able to comprehend the pure hatred I have for this body. I also feel guilty for not doing anything all day  but still procrastinate and feel stressed while doing so. Every night  I can’t sleep at all and start to think about every thing that’s wrong in my life  then i fall asleep and have nightmares almost every time. I can’t stop comparing myself to everyone I know  and think about how dumb  ugly  fat and useless I feel. I feel so lost and behind in life compared to people my age or people I know. But I don’t have the motivation to do anything about it or even think positively  so I just pity myself. I think what makes me feel the worst is I can’t bring myself to accept the way I’m feeling. I stay on my phone all day to avoid my brain from having these negative thoughts  then nighttime comes and everything comes out at once. I can’t talk about it to my brother and my parents cause I’m just not used to it and it brings me a huge feeling of discomfort  but keeping everything to myself is so painful too. These feelings are so heavy that I couldn’t even bring myself to talk about them to my therapist  it just wouldn’t come out and I don’t know why  so I just lied during my session. I don’t know how to get out of this negative place I’m in mentally,2,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1jgz9ro/3_am_mental_breakdown/
loneliness,19m. I don’t have anyone to relate to.,I’m not good at anything. And it is partly my fault and it partly isn’t. Number one I’m poor as fuck. My family is very very poor. Lower middle class. House looks like shit. But I’m not a tough guy  hood rat anything like that because I grew up in a preppy white neighborhood. Everyone has nice houses while mine looks like a trap house in the middle of the nice neighborhood. I never had nice toys growing up. Never had ps4 or Xbox. It doesn’t matter  I’m not superficial. As a kid I was draw and make cut outs and use newspaper to make my own toys. I’m decently intelligent  but I act like a tard. Why? I have anxiety an ocd diagnosed  but I also VERY VERY likely have adhd. Very likely as in I was in denial for the longest time  and my parents didn’t want to get me tested and I was supposed to get tested but I never did. People with adhd literally tell me I have adhd. I have almost every key mark symptom. Don’t even want to get tested atp bc for some reason every other loser who has it gate keeps it. It’s severe if i do have it. Well that sucks  my parents don’t believe in it  I’m already past Highschool so there’s little benefit in getting aid now  and I did decent in Highschool but struggling my ass off now and there’s little I can do about it. It keeps me up at night at times. Mind wont shut up. If it’s not that it’s my ocd or anxiety giving me a tuff time. If it’s not that THEN ITS MY DUST MITE ALLEGY AND ASTHMA  WHCIH LITERALLY MAKES IT HARD TO BREATHE  SLEEP  AND FOCUS ON TOP OF ALL THAT. Well at least I can eat what I want right? Wrong. I have gut issues. Like really bad. I suspect I have IBS but again never got diagnosed because my luck with things in general is just not great and one of those things is getting help I need. Maybe the world just doesn’t care for me. No matter how many other people I help it doesn’t seem to come back to me. People automatically are aggressive towards me. No matter how big or small. So I struggle to think  focus  eat  rest  properly perhaps I’m gifted in some other aspect? Athletics? I love sports. Too bad I suck at almost everything athletic. I’ve never been fast. Never. Have horrible stamina. Assume both of that is from asthma. My speed and stamina have improved REALLY dramatically since a child and I’m grateful. I guess at this point I’m slightly above average if anything but that’s because I’m a young male and the world is majority metabolically unhealthy. My genetics aren’t great for lifting or athletics. I have a very lanky frame  and I am skinny fat. I have great agility and jumping power though  I’m greatful for that but if I was healthy I would be even better. You’d think I was athletic looking at me but I hate being such a disappointment. My catching abilities are also subpar. And don’t get me started on throwing. One thing I was blessed with is looks. Sort of. I have decent facial features  and my face holds very little fat and is quite robust. But all this does is make me attention hungry and self obsessed because it’s one of the few good things in my life. Or was. I have auto immune condition that not only fqs up my skin but now is affecting my hair. My hair use to give me tips at the drive though. I was bullied as a kid for being ulgy so when I was getting praised all of a sudden it felt insanely good. Now it’s Thinner all over. Think it’s affecting my facial hair too. My skin use to be great now it’s uneven  blemished  has acne scars  ACTUAL scars  and I have had multitide of issues in the past like whiteheads  keratosis pilaris  eczema you name it. Right now I have clogged inner sweat glands on my thighs. Gross. My penis I think is probably below average. The acid reflex and probably increased acidity from difficulty breathing while I sleep makes my teeth naturally yellow. I had fqed teeth as a child and I got braces but they took so long an never finished the job so now I have a gap between one of my teeth and my canine so I look like a pirate. And although I said I have good looks  I’m slightly above average at best. I’m by no means some Sean o pry or anything like that. I’m also a dark skinned  curly haired Indian. And I have all these health issues so young  plus fqed teeth so now it doesn’t matter if a girl checks me  it’s almost basically clips. And because I’m south Asian  but dark skinned male with curly hair I’m hated on by literally every race. White  black my own  you name it. Can’t name a single group of people or country whre I feel like I’d belong and get appreciated by the people. Def not my ethnic country Bangladesh and prob not the USA. I was a class clown growing up so epople sort of like me for that but nobody takes my feeling seriously at the same time. And like I said  my ethnic origin and phenotype may not be ideal but I got to look good for like a few years and now (whole still in my youth) I barely get to experience that now. I have nothing redeemable at this point. My family hates me. They have yelled at me constantly my whole life. I’m horrible ways. And I’m a freaking baby. I wish so much I was a brave  tough non anxious man. So much so. My mom and dad hate each other but never divorced because of culture. Verbal and physical violence towards me  and each other was so common growing up. I in general don’t succeed in things I’m passionate about. I was religious from 13-17 to cope with all my stress in life. Islamic. Now I’m starting to let go of thst too. I was never raised religious   I took it upon my self. My dad literally doesn’t even like it. He constantly ridicules me and hates me for being religious. How unlucky am i  I’m the only one with an ethnic dad who dislikes that his son is religious? The religion he basically chose FOR ME. All he does is talk about grades and talk down on me and my mom. Back to my looks I’m much taller than him. One of the few good things in my life is my height but I honestly don’t care mcuh for it. My sister hates me too. She has anger issues and my parents can barely handle her. Yet they bought her a car. And not me even though I was and still am in college and full time employed. I have this ridiculously annoying cousin who can’t mind her own busienss for her life who immigrated here and lives with us. 30 year old child. Well she as gone.. WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE  and now that I dropped out and am attending university near my house she back..my life bro. My job pays below minimum wage and biweekly yet I love it. It’s one of the few escape I have. I don’t play video games much bc of lack of access  proper education and because I’m not great at those either. All these people talking about money doesn’t buy happiness  or how they are falling apart because of a heartbreak and yet I can barely struggle to enjoy even the little pleasures in life and for what reason? What wrong have I done? I’m not even superficial never have been all I wanted was a chance and I never got it? I don’t even have the balls to take my own pathetic life. I hate natural selection for ignoring all my ancestors and somehow making a mess like me. I use to be scared of dying in my sleep  but if I could be guaranteed heaven in the afterlife I’d take it in a heartbeat. So tired of living my life. I’m sorry for this rant but I have to let all this out. There are a dozen or more other things I could have listed. But as I’m typing this it’s 7am and I got like four hours sleep last night and want to get some more today. I’m sorry if reading this wasted your time.,1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1jlswsi/19m_i_dont_have_anyone_to_relate_to/
loneliness,Birthday blues…,,2,1,https://i.redd.it/8bq10p7qx8te1.jpeg
loneliness,I just feel so alone.,"I’ve always struggled to make friends  and I’ve never really felt like I fitted in anywhere  but I’ve never felt as alone as I do right now. I go to work  come home  feel lonely  go to bed  then repeat. I can’t go through life spending the rest of my days feeling like this.

I’m in a completely different situation to where I thought I’d be at 23. In some ways  things have turned out better  but in other ways  they’re a lot worse. I’m trying to get on my own two feet  but my future feels pretty bleak and lonely with the way things are.

I work a minimum wage job in retail  which I enjoy at times  but it’s not something I want to do forever. Right now I think having a job makes me one of the lucky ones. A job is better than no job. I know my job is important  as I need to earn a living  but I have a non existent social life. I know that the answer is to try and meet new people  but I don’t really know how to do this. I’ve never liked drinking or clubbing  which is what most people my age like to do. An enjoyable day out for me would be something like going to the cinema  or taking a walk along the beach  but I’m not going to meet people by doing these things. 
Most of my hobbies are things I can do by myself  and even with something like video games  I prefer to play alone as it’s my downtime activity to relax. I know there’s sites like meetup that have organised groups to meet people  but I work shifts for my job  and it’s very rare I’m off on a weekend. I’m not going to be able to meet people I could eventually hang out with on an individual basis  who would make plans with me around work  if I can’t show up to the groups in the first place. 

I’ve tried to make friends online  but as I’m sure a lot of you have experienced  ghosting is a common problem. I’m not giving up  but I’m trying to strike a balance between trying to put myself out there  but not spending too much time searching. I’ve spent too long on the likes of Reddit looking to see if there’s anyone like me  but then feeling awful and more alone because I haven’t found it. 

I do struggle with socialising a bit  but I’m determined to not let that hold me back. I’ve always been a quiet and introverted person  until I get to know someone well. I think it’s a coping mechanism I’ve developed due to past experiences that I feel like running a mile when someone new talks to me. My brain convinces me that I’m better off on my own than being vulnerable with someone and getting hurt  but deep down  I’d love to talk to someone. The idea of walking into a room full of new people and introducing myself absolutely terrifies me. My job has forced me to come out of my shell to a point  and even just small talk with customers makes me feel like I’m improving my social skills. However  even with colleagues who I’ve now known for over six months  I’m still planning my next response in a conversation or worrying whether I’ve said the right thing or not. I tend to trip over my words  but the more I try to correct it  the more my sentence just sounds like a bunch of noises. I’m also someone who goes red the more someone stares. I’m scared I come across as this awkward  pathetic kid  and I’m conscious that some colleagues sometimes seem to be more laughing at me than with me. 

I’m also a trans guy and asexual. The dating pool is therefore already massively reduced  which is made worse by me being trans. Being trans has been the most isolating experience of my life  and I wouldn’t wish it upon anyone.  I’ve never been in a relationship  and despite being asexual  I would like some romance and someone to make some memories with. I also feel like the older I get  the more it will look like a red flag if I haven’t ever been with anyone. There’s no local groups for ace people  but I’ve tried online in various ace specific places. Despite being in the UK  which is small compared to the likes of places like the US  most people seem to be down south near London  whereas I’m up in the north. When you’re already part of such a small minority  it feels even worse when you’re then alienated from that community. 

The problem is  you start to convince yourself after a while that there’s something wrong with you. If everyone else has friends and partners  and not you  you’re clearly the problem  right? The amount of times I’ve felt unwanted  unloveable  and invisible because no one has given me the time of day is too many to count. I try my best to be nice to people I encounter both on and offline  because I often think how nice it would be if someone just sat down and was genuinely interested in me and what I had to say. 

I often wonder why I’m trying to build a life for myself. I don’t want to live if I’m just going to be doing everything alone. I know some people are perfectly happy on their own  and I respect that  but that’s no life for me. I’m getting pretty fed up of people saying ‘You’re young  you’ll meet someone.’ I have no one. I’m so scared I’m go to go through this life alone and die alone. I know I’m not very optimistic  but you start wondering after a while if things are ever going to change.",13,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1crnw23/i_just_feel_so_alone/
loneliness,I’m lonely. I have a family but I feel so alone.,"Hello. I’m here because I’m drowning in feelings. Please don’t be cruel. I’m married. I have a husband and children  my parents are alive  and I have a brother who has a family. I’ve never really had close friends; I always got along better with men. My husband was my best friend—the person I trusted with my opinions and feelings about many things.

We’ve been married for over a decade  we have children  but we’re in crisis. Over time  I stopped talking to my friends  both men and women  because I was focused on running the household and raising my children. My family hates him  so if I tell them about this crisis  they’ll obviously say they were right.

I feel very alone. I have to swallow my feelings  and today  I feel like I can’t take it anymore.

loneliness,I hate feeling so alone,"Ok I might have made a post about this recently but icl this app is like my vent place and I feel like shit so I will talk about it. 

Anyways  recently I've gotten closer to my friends (I used to feel more like a bystander back then  I still feel more like a backup friend but I am more included in things now) and I'm a little more distant with my family. Either way in terms of loneliness  I haven't been feeling completely alone anymore but I still feel like there's a part missing. That part is romantic love. 

I really feel like I need a romantic relationship for so many reasons  to have that level of physical affection that you only get with a partner (not sex tho)  to have someone I can care about and vice versa  to have someone who just loves me in general. I don't know how to explain how I feel when I say that I know that I'm missing a romantic relationship in my life but I know it's definitely that. 

Some people are probably thinking that it's because I don't love myself enough. I definitely do though. I like who I am  although I have major gender dysphoria sometimes. 

I swear though I can never find anyone who would be into me yet also respect me in terms of being trans (since I haven't started my transition yet). The only people who want me are people on the internet who want nudes (which is not very fun). I can't lie  it's getting to the point where I'm soon gonna be willing to e-date. I just desire for someone to love me the way I think I deserve to be loved.

loneliness,What can i do to stop feeling so alone?,hey everyone. it’s christmas day and i feel like absolute shit. i’m so lonely i want to cry. it’s not even like i haven’t spoken to people today. i have a few really good friends that i’ve chatted to and a couple other people but for some reason i’ve been checking my phone all day and i don’t even know what i’m waiting for. i’ve just been feeling so alone recently. probably because my best friend ghosted me for no apparent reason haha. even though i have other friends i can talk to and i don’t even want to be friends with that person anymore i just feel like i don’t have anyone anymore. i feel like when i reach out to some of my other friends they don’t really want to talk to me which idk could just be me reading too much into their replies ha but also since we all go to different colleges now and they’ve made new friends  i don’t even see them much anymore and have to arrange everything in advance if we want to. i’ve tried to make new friends at college and do have some people that i talk to but not really out of college and they don’t seem to have any interest in doing so. it’s like i’m trying so hard to find a connection but nobody’s reciprocating it and i feel like shit. i’m trying to be positive and develop myself more with new hobbies and going to places but this feeling of being alone is really getting to me. idek why though because i know i have people like i was invited out with a group of people from my sports club soon yet i still feel so unwanted.  i’ve been through worse in the past yet i feel so horrible now. sorry for the yap jeez. any advice would be greatly appreciated ☺️,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1hmbzxm/what_can_i_do_to_stop_feeling_so_alone/

loneliness,Surviving chronic loneliness while on the journey to greatness.....Why do I feel so disconnected to others  have no friends and feel so alone in my ambition...PLEASE HELP!!!!, Hello  I am a final year medical student who is extremely ambitious and to put it frankly a high-achiever. I'm person who believes that everyone was put on this planet for a purpose. Cliche  I know  however I do not only want to improve my life but have great impact on the lives of others. People around me call me 'overzealous'- but they usually say that in a patronizing way. I have always struggled to connect with people because they simply never understood my ambitions and dreams. I also struggled to make friends for similar reasons. I'm SO TIRED AND EXSHAUSTED from being alone. I've been a lone wolf all my life but I am feed up with it. I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Even on anti-depressants I am still suicidal (sorry if this is alarming or too raw but it's the honest truth). I really want to find people with similar minds  principles  virtues foundational values and views it doesn't have to be medical related at all.

loneliness,I have a plan to slowly stop feeling so alone,"I want to stop being afraid. It has been so long and hard  enforcing loneliness upon myself. I've always been my own worst enemy. And so  today it is going to stop ... and slowly begin to reverse.

Someone recently told me I have to provide more detailed  actionable plans of action  or things won't ever improve. That's true  I s'pose. Rationally  I know that I can't just bask in hostility and self-denial  irrationally assuming the rest of the world is out to get to me. I must give other people the benefit of the doubt ... even (and especially) when they fail to do the same  making unfair assumptions and wide-sweeping generalizations about me.

We ought to take the high road  or we are no better than those we cast stones upon.

So ... here's my baby-step plan. Tomorrow  I'm going to walk into town ... I'm going to find a stranger in a social situation: store  restaurant  whatever ... and I'm going to make small talk  like a normal human being.

I know that I won't make a friend out of the experience.

I also know that my heart will be leaping into my throat ... my throat will be tightening into a narrow choke ... and my trembling hands will be clammy with cold sweat.

As a dyed-in-the-wool  antisocial introvert  I absolutely *hate* this idea.

And I hate being riddled with so paralyzing social anxiety. I know there's something wrong with me psychologically. But I also know I'll never improve if I keep inconsistently laying hostile blame at the feet of society while refusing to acknowledge my own culpability in being a loser.

I have to somehow overcome this petrifying fear of Other People if I have ever hope of being a not-broken person. I do not like who I am today ... and I know I won't transform into a social butterfly tomorrow  or next week  or even next year.

... but I also feel confident that tomorrow I can hold my head up high  look myself in the mirror  and honestly say that I've been brave enough to initiate a brief conversation (mere “chitchat”) with a total stranger.

And that's a victory I think my bruised and battered ego sorely needs. I think I need this. 

At the end of The Great Gatsby  F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote:

> “Gatsby believed in the green light  the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then  but that’s no matter – tomorrow we will run faster  stretch out our arms farther ... and one fine morning –   
>  
>So we beat on  boats against the current  borne back ceaselessly into the past.”

I have a habit of misunderstanding things and thoroughly making a pig's breakfast out of what was *actually meant* when somebody says something ... but I'm inspired by Fitzgerald's words. One tiny motion after another  step-by-step  steadily towards that green light at Daisy's East Egg dock: the light that symbolizes hopes and dreams for a brighter tomorrow ... and I'm *going* to run faster  work harder  study more  and take chances. Yeah  it feels like I'm beating against the current ... but in truth  I'm pushing forward  against the stream – against the tide – by taking one little risk at a time.

And it starts with li'l baby me making a li'l baby step tomorrow.

Experience says I will almost certainly fail; and that's all right. Because I intend to continue falling down and getting back up again  time after time after time ... and one fine morning –

... well  that part of my story isn't written yet. 

So wish me luck: tomorrow I will be one iota braver than I am this evening. I'm sure there's a million  billion things wrong with my stupid  bone-headed plan. But this is my life  and if I'm unhappy with it ... I have to take specific  functional  actionable steps  or nothing will ever get better. 

So tomorrow morning comes step one.",21,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/db2p5o/i_have_a_plan_to_slowly_stop_feeling_so_alone/

loneliness,I am so alone (TW Self-Harm and Suicide Attempts),I (18M) have felt lonely my entire life. I cut myself the first time when I was like 12. Nearly jumped off a bulding at 13.

loneliness,TW: Self Harm/Alcohol Abuse: Major Relapse.,"I’ve been drinking consistently for 3 weeks straight. I’ve been terrified of going to bed sober. My anxiety keeps me up at night and my mental health is declining - fast. 

All the days have merged into one and I can’t help but self loathe and dwell on all the shit that’s happened in my life  my regrets  my humiliations  my lack of self respect  my confidence  I just fucking drown in it. 

I relapsed hard a few nights ago. I was on the phone with someone I thought I was gonna spend the rest of my life with and I just broke the fuck down. I ended up cutting myself in the corner of my room  thinking the camera couldn’t see me. I was sorely mistaken. I began laughing maniacally and just lost it. 

I hate having to wear long sleeved shirts again. I hate being in fear every day of my life. I’m so fucking tired. I’m tired of smiling at my Dad and not knowing there’s a deep and dark  profound sadness behind it. I’m sick of coming home to an empty and disgusting house  covered in old plates  beer bottles and broken glass. 

I’m sick of people looking at me with pity. I’m sick of people disregarding me  pushing me aside as irrelevant  looking at me like I’m about to rob them or assault them. 

I’m sick of everyone around me giving me non-advice and looking the other way. That’s what happened to my late friend. He told everyone he wanted to end it  but people are disgusting. Myself included and just turn the other cheek  blissfully ignorant of the reality around them.

How long have I waited for the good? A long time! So  it's not so hard for me to wait a little longer! I humble myself in the meantime.

loneliness,A lifetime of loneliness,"There's nothing more soul-destroying  more filling of deep despair   than knowing you are one of a kind.

In fact  if it hadn't been for the Internet  I probably would have winded up as that nutty old woman screaming obscenities on the frozen streets of my hometown  only going home to feed my 7 cats.

It's a permeating syllogism   isn't it  that the outcasts   the lonely  the dispossessed and even those surrounded by those who love him  worship him  admire him... but never truly understanding him  that if you feel lonely   you're either not as lonely/or lonelier than everyone else... but we somehow fail to make the connection to like-minded souls because _our_ loneliness feels /different/ and hence fills us with more darkness.

I remember a time when only my tender naïve clinging to faith  in a universal and benevolent Father  was my only lifeline. In fact   my religion explicitly forbids me to take my own life and the lessons are so ingrained in our internal wiring that is would take immeasurable physical suffering to reach a point where one of us would want to give up. 

My childhood and early adulthood was fraught with trauma. I won't bore anyone with details. It's a recursive story that repeats itself endlessly throughout human history and regurgitating everything would just leave a bitter taste in my mouth. 

Abuse. Harm. Terror. Anxiety. Fear. Lack of self-worth. These are all old friends who visit us at the best and worst of moments.

loneliness,Some people are born alone,"I don't know if the title makes sense at all but I'll just explain my point. I'm speaking as a mixed child in a European country so racism plays a good role in this  at least in my opinion.
Loneliness has ALWAYS been in my life.
When I was a child  my parents would beg people to come to my birthdays  they'd beg them to buy me a gift and then give them the money back. However  I was never invited to birthday parties  whenever they gave out the invitations they'd just look at me and hand it to the person next to me or simply walk away  I never had friends in elementary  parents would tell their kids to stay away from me. I remember I'd cry to my mom and ask her if it's because I'm not completely Italian.
Since kids in my school didn't seem to like me  my mom put me into a gymnastic course. I was bullied so hard I had to quit.
Middle school was even worse. Had fake accounts made on the internet pretending to be me and saying gross things. Rumors about self harm. I'd walk into class and find very rude stuff scribbled on my desk. Pictures of me taken by other girls so they could make them into stickers and send them to each other on WhatsApp. Fake love letters sent to me and even got asked out in front of everyone in the courtyard just for the guy to laugh and say it was a dare. I was starting to suck at school and starting to get addicted to my phone which led to my parents becoming stricter and even sometimes hit me. However  it was not all that bad because I had my group of girls  so at least  even if my mental health was declining and I was starting to neglect myself completely  I wasn't alone.
Then  three years ago  I had to leave the only friends I ever had to go into highschool and stuff got even worse. I don't remember when the last time I left home with someone who wasn't a family member was. I'm barely passing my classes and risked being held back every year  my parents gave up on me and stopped beating me up this year. In class  I am a ghost  except gross and now perverted rumors about me are still being made up. The girls in my class are only five including me  they made a ""girls only"" WhatsApp group  added me to it for half a minute and then kicked me out. It's such a little thing but it destroyed me to be honest  to think they didn't even acknowledge my existence enough as ""female classmate"" to add me into that group. This led me to trying to change myself  thinking that maybe my """"masculine"""" (double quotation marks because thats the closest adjective i could find to descrie it) appearance was the problem. I grew my curly hair out and straightened it  I wore tighter clothes  I lost 7kgs and started taking care of myself  I stopped drawing manga  I started doing tennis and talking more. Nothing really changed.
It just feels like the problem is me. Not the way I am.
A few days ago I went to the pool with two of the girls who were my friends in middle school (whom I haven't seen for over two years) since it was the birthday of one of them. I don't think I was able to say a word without one of them interrupting me or talking over me...if we even talked about something I could participate in  since the two of them started speaking about their ""three days vacation in Tuscany"" together  about when they were going to leave  what they were going to bring etc. Vacation I knew nothing about. Mind you I introduced them to each other. I really don't mind them going to vacations together  this isn't the first time that has happened  but if you invited me to your birthday and I paid money for your expensive gift  at least include me in your chats...or don't talk about your vacations together in front of me. Actually  feel free to do it and I may even give you some advice but please don't let it be the only thing you talk about  I am here too. (this may just be me being soft).
The things I went through honestly made me think  and it's almost like I was born to be alone or to be treated like this. I was born with an average screentime of 10 hours. I was born with 0 friends. I was born to be almost 16 and have no idea of what a club looks like. I was born to not be able of maintaining a relationship or keeping a conversation going. I was born to make posts like these on reddit when the people I know don't even know what reddit is.

I'm so sorry for the huge rant it's just that since it's summer and there's no school I have more time to think. It's almost embarrassing to post this here because some of the people here really have it hard hard hard  way harder than me and I am just a teen. This is a bit less dramatic than the other post because I'm not crying my eyes out while writing it this time. I'm very sorry if it's hard to read  English is not my first language.

loneliness,I can't even lie I'm lonely as F.,"So... How do you even begin such a thread? I'm 31  male  from Poland. I'm neurodivergent  depressed and have anxiety disorder (taking meds for this). I have a pretty good paying (but dead-endish) job  have my interests and hobbies. Love reading  music and other things. All my life I felt permeating loneliness and a feeling of difference from people both my age  older and younger... I can hold a conversation  but other people baffle me with things they actually care about. Especially younger people  who seem not even interested in talking to eachother  let alone me (in work etc). 

Being neurodivergent  but not diagnosed what exactly I ""have""  my Interests are pretty weird I admit  I play bass  guitar  some piano  can sing pretty good  love weird and old music  but can listen and appreciate normie music too. I love reading  making some kick ass coffee (v60  flair espresso etc)  have very good manual skills (I'm currently building a 3d printer of my own design from scratch  have built a bass guitar only using hand tools  can do home renovations etc  actually can do amazing massages too  since that's one of my Interests and I have read a few books/practiced a lot). I exercise - calisthenics and free weights  eat well (when I eat... Since my appetite fluctuates with depression episodes)  take care of myself  have a pretty good body imo (and my exes opinion too :p) except for my face... Which I feel is unattractive  as in not in the canon of beauty (big nose  no too prominent jaw and cheekbones) 

I had one serious partner. It was a love which was coming from both of us  she loved me and I loved her. The chemistry was amazing  sex was simply indescribably good. It was perfect. She was the most beautiful woman I have ever laid my eyes upon..Welp... Turned out she was married. We were ""together"" for six years. She also was suffering from depression  and She had laid off her meds  proclaimed that She wants to be pregna t with her husband. I was speechless. Maybe I'm dumb  but I still love her  despite this  and I doubt I can ever forget her embrace. She wanted to keep being together somehow  but for the good of her child I backed out. I want her to be happy  her child and husband to be happy too. For them to be complete... I took the hit on me completely it seems since when I check her FB page she seems to be happy. Since the break my depression evolved into actual wishing to die and self harm  poisoning myself  hating myself... I tried to take my life on multiple occasions. My mother took me to therapy  but after four different attempts with different specialists  no help could be found.

I actually feel like my death is imminent. My heart physically hurts  but I wont resist if I get a heart attack. During one of my attempts I took 2k mg dph and all of my antidepresants (hundreds od pills of duloxetine) but I'm still there somehow. 

Now I feel that all I do is wake up  go to work and try to talk with some people I think are as weird as I am  then go to sleep after work. Life is pretty much meaningless. I have a Tinder account with no matches (yes  I am dumb enough to actually pay for premium  boosts  superlikes etc) despite actually having pretty good photos considering my looks and having a good bio there  being nice and sincere with others... I don't understand it. My iq is 139 and my diagnosis is simple - I'm ugly. Personality  your status  heck even cock size dont matter at all when you are ugly. That's all she wrote and we can deceive ourselves if so we choose. So... Yeah I'm pretty sure that's what is on my mind right now.

Actually  I was texting a girl I know  we had good chemistry and all but got ghosted. Wtf is with peoples manners nowadays? I thought everything was good  but I was mistaken once again.

All I wish for right now is love  you know? I don't even mean sex  despite really liking making love and allegedly being really good at it (which I suspect was the reason Alice was with me  a weirdo  for so long?) but right now all I want is to love and be loved in return  like souls love eachother  care for eachother... Try to keep each other warm during this storm called life... But I feel like that's just past me. I'm done with it  but not from my choice. People call men like me ""incels"" I learn... I don't have anything in common with those men  but I do understand their loneliness  feelings of being an alien. In a way  I get the anger too  but I am not angry at women  I actually really care and am courteous even when I'm rejected. But... I just don't know what to say... Why even say anything. Don't you understand? I bet you do  since you are here. I want to talk with someone  I want to build a future for my wife  my kids. I cant do it goddammit :( I actually watch porn to see women smile and stuff since I can't make anyone smile in this way... It's really pathetic and I want to die thinking about that.

Yes... All that wall of text was written while crying  after work and laying in bath. I'm gonna clean myself up and get to bed I think  but if you wanna talk... Please talk to me (quoting Joni Mitchell)",5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1gfo50p/i_cant_even_lie_im_lonely_as_f/
loneliness,All the ways in which I'm alone  physically and emotionally,"Today is a bad day so I need to rant somewhere. I want to preface this by saying that I've been in therapy and I've worked through trauma from the past  but in all honesty  not through all the trauma. That's not to say that I am suppressing those emotions  but I still have ways of coping that are not healthy in the long run  addictive behaviour being one of them. Now for the story...

  
I don't like my parents  and I am starting to think I never have. I don't hate them  I love them  and I know they love me  but I am somewhat disappointed in the upbringing that I experienced. I was raised in the typical small conservative town surrounded by orthodox christians and inundated with that doctrine. One of my few saving graces was that my parents had largely broken free of that sphere of influence and were decidedly more liberal. My dad identifies as agnostic to this day  and my mother adheres to her own brand of christianity which doesn't require her to go to church. I know that my parents tried to raise me  but I am not convinced that they tried their best. 

The problem with my parents' upbringing is that they were raised in a very practical way; old-school parenting as it were. They weren't taught to communicate with emotions  least of all on how to validate emotions; their upbringing was authoritarian and included physical punishment; and they were raised to have an opinion on everything  even things which didn't affect them or harm them. While they left some of these bad examples behind  some of them they took with them. I know for a fact that my sister and brother got spanked  and luckily my parents phased that out of their parenting by the time I came around. 

Unfortunately  my parents had their other shortcomings. Like their own parents before them  they were bad in emotional validation or comfort; my dad was a fixer that treated everything like a problem that could be solved. He didn't understand my desire to sometimes simply talk to him. He also couldn't handle me having a melancholic personality. He was impatient and when trying to help me  he gave me simplified watered-down solutions. When teaching me something he rarely taught me how to go about doing something and instead just gave me the answer which fed into my insecurities as I never actually learned the how. I quicly learned feeling like a bother for asking for help. My mother was even more sensitive to my moods  but instead of comforting me she was either short with me  or talked about her own problems  not understanding that she basically turned me into her stand-in therapist. My mother was also extremely self-centered and quite lacking in her  self reflection. She could be callous and mean with her comments and then backtracked when she was called out on it. She hardly ever apologized. Both my parents were raised with the notion that you had to have an opinion on everything and while they let me play the games I liked and watch the movies I preferred  they always treated these like they were of lesser value than the ""cultured""  ""educated"" and ""mature"" media that they were engaged in. They didn't understand that this felt invalidating of my genuine interests.

Where my dad was always lecturing people about the ""correct"" viewpoint to have  my mother always turned any conversation to herself. On an emotional level  I can't connect with my parents because they've never had the patience to learn to understand me  and they simply found me and my emotions difficult. The way in which I was raised made me feel anxious  insecure and weird and I almost never was able to really connect with a friend. My parents also barely gave me autonomy in my life choices as a minor  and I did everything I could to please them. Because I tried to achieve good grades (in which I ultimately failed in high school) I barely had time for friends and was very bad at maintaining connections and prioritizing my social skills. My parents were overly critical and made comments about my shortcomings  not realizing how much it further fed into my insecurities. They always commented about what I wasn't engaged in at the moment and because of that I felt like I had to juggle everything. They never taught me to let things go. Additionally  my dad could get into a vindictive tough love mentality  he mocked me several times in my life for failing  not understanding the psychological reasons behind why I couldn't manage things in school.

My parents also weren't the most collaborative unit. They disagreed with each other on everything and they argued with each other at the dining table in our presence. My mother was oversensitive and very quickly perceived an insult  and my dad always hahd to push through what he wanted. He was incapable of compromising and if he couldn't get his way  he would alter the conditions on the agreements he made with my mother without informing her. After 30 years together they got divorced  and I wish they'd done it far earlier.

But that isn't the entire story. The other part of the story is that I was the youngest brother of my two siblings. My sister  the responsible second mom; and my brother the problem middle child. My brother was born with severe psychological deficiencies and he got diagnosed with PDDNOS and a non-verbal learning disorder. He got into trouble quite early in his life  he was impulsive and sensitive and soon he got home drunk and got in touch with drugs. My parents did everything to try to keep him out of problem and I was neglected for that reason. My parents are aware of their neglect and they are deeply regretful  but they can't turn back time. Because of the problems with my brother  my sister  my mother and my dad tried to protect my from everything  which honestly felt suffocating. They got involved in every aspect of my life and had an opinion on everything. The worst cases of this were them having discussions with each other about choices that I had to make and getting into arguments about it. I was barely able to let myself be heard. I honestly just wanted to be invisible. But that was impossible. My home was a minefield  my brother was a timebomb. Any slight disagreement could lead into insane arguments with people shouting at each other and doors slamming. The fiasco with my brother ultimately ended with him dying due to overdose and me and my sister coming out of the situation with PTSD.

  
My PTSD wasn't just because of my home situation  but also because I was bullied  making it even harder to make friends. people could smell my insecurity from a mile away. All the stressors  at home and in school caused me to have severe anger issues. At home my boundaries weren't respected and I got into arguments with my sister  my brother and my mother. My sister manipulated me  because she was used to getting what she wanted  my brother manipulated me because of his addiction  and my mother manipulated me because she couldn't admit she was wrong. She also took advantage of my kindness and always asked for help with even the smallest of chores which she could do herself. 

Outside of my family life I was unable to maintain friendships. I didn't dare to be myself  I was needy for validation  and I was terrible at setting boundaries. I made poor choices in friends to which I held onto for too long. I was distrustful of the people who were genuinely kind and I missed chances to make valuable friendships. This went as far as my life in college were I finally hit the breaking point  got depressed  burned out and stuck writing my thesis. This all happened in the midst of COVID. Ultimately I graduated  but I am living with my mom in the same town where I grew up. I have no close friends and I don't feel comfortable at home. I don't hate my mom  but I have no intimate emotional connection with her either. I feel like I am no one's closest friend  and that it's impossible for me to make valuable friendships. I don't feel at home and I don't feel like there any means for me to meet good friends. I lost two friends this year  because I realized that I settled for less. We had different views on friendship and we expected a different level of investment. It also didn't help that one of them lives 3 hours away and the other one is hardly better. I felt a lot of pressure when they wanted to hang out with me and I felt like I couldn't communicate with them properly how I was introverted and needed more time to recharge. I tried to explain this  but one of them ultimately decided because of our disagreements to cut me off. I haven't messaged the other friend  because I simply don't know what to say. I am not sure if it's of more value to maintain our friendship or to break it. 

I have a well-paying job but I don't feel at home with my coworkers. I feel isolated and the only reason I am still living with my mom  is because of the cost of housing. I want to form a relationship with someone with whom I can be intimate  but I don't know how to go about that. I feel like people can sense my sadness and loneliness from a mile away  making it harder for me to make friends into my adult life. 

The reason all of this is coming up is because I am trying to quit addictive habits: junkfood  pornography  alcohol and media-consumption. It's either that or I am productive all the time. I have difficulty relaxing. However  now that I am trying to relax again  I get reminded of just how lonely I am. As long as I am busy  I can avoid that reality. As long as I feel good  I can avoid it so I watch porn  I drink alcohol  I eat junkfood  or I go to the gym. And where you might think this is healthy  it's compulsive. All the activities I am engaged in  are me running away from feeling lonely. I can never just be comfortable with myself.

loneliness,I'm dating someone who doesn't exist. Sorry for rambling.,"I (f/17) mean that in a very literal sense  he literally doesn't exist. I talk to him super often  he doesn't respond.. Which is good  I'd be freaked out if he did. Actually  no  I'd probably accept it. God  he's so perfect  no man is like him - he's everything and can be anyone I want!  He doesn't hurt me  he doesn't use me  he doesn't judge me  he's just perfect. 

He's the only thing holding me together  it's stupid but he stopped me from relapsing (self harm)  kind of ridiculous right? A imaginary boyfriend stopped me from cutting myself. Whatever works. 

Anyway  as for what he looks like? Well that changes pretty often  age  body type  height  hair  eyes  features  it all changes. I also haven't really ""named"" him or anything.. Too many names I like. But all that doesn't matter too much  I love him for who he is. I spend so much of my time listening to music and thinking of situations with me and him  I even act it out. I have a huge teddy bear I sleep with  I dress him up so it feels more real  and I cuddle with him. 

I'm trying to learn how to draw better so I could draw him and me  so I can finally.. See it  I tried using ai art but it's always feels too dead to me. I write stores a lot 50/50 between fan fiction and original works  almost all of the characters in my original works are based off of him.. Helps me stay grounded I guess. 

God  what I wouldn't do for him to be real  maybe I should make a AI chat bot version of him? Then it would feel more real  but is that good or bad for my overall mental health? Who knows!

loneliness,45 and I have never felt this lonely in my life,"In my short life span until now  I have been as truthful as possible to myself and others  have studied very hard and worked even harder all my life. I grew up in a toxic family environment with a narcissist and an enabler who kept pushing me to become what they wanted me to become so they could show me to their families and friends as a trophy son. As a child without the knowledge of what is right and what is wrong  I bought into the narrative that this is all for me and was ALWAYS (in their eyes) a very obedient good son who never objected to anything and kept taking it all in without complaining. At the young age of early 20s I simply had enough of this  fell in love with someone  broke all the ""rules"" that my toxic parents wanted me to follow  broke the chains and got out of the relationship with them in the old way portraying myself as a black sheep of the family. The relationship turned sour ever since as I wasn't following their narrative but encouraged by the idea of ""needing a family"" as someone who had been raised and brainwashed by one that was not normal  I kept the relationship. Throughout the years  I got smashed and smashed terribly between my wife and my toxic family. Years and years of taking the hit from both sides. The whole shebang of bitching each time I spoke to one until one day I had more than enough and stopped all communications with my parents and siblings (all being part of the same pack). I was left with only having 1 relationship and that was with my wife. That obviously did not help either as my wife kept going behind the scenes even after there is no relationship in place playing victim  bitching behind them and blaming me for not cutting the tied earlier to avoid the damage. This feels as if it is only she who has been in the middle getting the hit and I am the one who never cared. 
So much drama  accusations  disrespect  and shame blended with labelling me as a sick person who still thinks about his parents (I do think and am sad about the kind of parents I have never had...) telling me I need to fix myself  not trusting me and some times even telling me she believes I am still in touch with them and bypassing her  blah blah...
Because of not having time enough due to overworking myself my whole life and also trusting her to be my best friend  I also don't have any friends. Neither does she as she spends the entire day at home not going ANYWHERE swiping through short clips on insta and from time to time picking at me... 
I feel completely stuck  totally alone in life with absolutely no one whom I can even speak to who can understand my pain and deeply depressed about what I desire that I do not have...I don't like to go back to my toxic family and in fact they never even made an attempt to contact me for this  I also don't like to continue living with my wife but I feel scared  abandoned and ashamed of my age to be stuck in such an emotional misery. I am an intelligent person whom others bank on for many things work and life but when it comes down to myself  I feel like a complete wreck... 
I am not seeking any suggestions here or even a sense of empathy as none will help me. Maybe my way of describing this out in here might help me relieve the pain tad bit for this moment. 
All in all  I feel very sad and I only wish  I could ge the courage and strength to remove myself from all bad relationships (well the last remaining one)  and build new ones as time flies and I am getting closer to death...

loneliness,Can't make it on my own any longer,"My (41 F) life in a nutshell:

I grew up in a dysfunctional family with physical and mental abuse. Was bullied at school. Started drinking and taking drugs as a teenager.

In my mid-twenties  I found a spiritual community that helped me out of that lifestyle and a few years later  I left my home country and moved to a place where this community is more active. Lost contact with all of my old friends.

Have always been struggling to fit into society  dropped out of university and got a job but burnt out in my early 30's. Was diagnosed with autism and adhd around that time. Also ended up homeless  was moving around a lot between 2014 and 2018 with no place to rest while also suffering from major depression and serious fatigue. Got no support from my family  they only carried on with mental abuse so I cut off ties with them.

Got disability pension 2018 at the age of 35. Found a decent place to live but also isolated myself totally since then. Was also in a destructive relationship  ended it in late 2019 since he threatened to beat me up and kill me. Then pandemic happened and I got even more isolated.

Left the spiritual community last year since I found out they're a cult; got no real support from them whatsoever  they just manipulated me into thinking that all negative things happening to me are my own fault and result of my past actions  and there was nothing I could do about it and that I was on my own. Got contact with some cult survivor groups and made close friends with one person online. Soon we developed romantic feelings to each other and since a couple of months or so we've been in a long distance relationship. He's been my everything since then but just like me  he suffers from ptsd and has since 10 days or so behaved very weirdly. Isolated from the rest of the world  hardly responding to my messages and when he does  it takes nearly one day or so.

I think I'm having a mental breakdown  I'm nearly suicidal. What's the point of going on with life? It's only been a series of tragedies and I seem to make terrible mistakes all the time. Have zero friends I can rely on and I'm too broken to make it on my own. Thought that me and my boyfriend (or maybe I should consider myself single at this point?) would have supported each other and start a new life together but it seems he's not on the same page anymore. I just can't cope with him disappearing  not giving me any kind of validation or showing any signs that he wants to communicate with me and sort things out. So on top of all this  my heart's also broken now.

After a life like this  how can I carry on without family or friends or anyone to rely on? I just want to give up",2,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1jmo7da/cant_make_it_on_my_own_any_longer/
loneliness,TWICE!,"TWICE NOW THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED! 

I made two female friends both of which close to my age (18M) and both of them ended up doing the exact same thing to me and cut off all contact from me without saying a word  I've made myself clear that I'm kind and innocent that I still have much to learn about certain things that I an adult should now by now  I've even so much as agreed to being in a relationship with one of and they were 17 so it's not like it was illegal  I respected their boundaries and I told them that I was lonely and need someone to help comfort me  it's not too much to ask  Friends help each other not betray them  but for some reason I meet them on here  we re-route our conversation over to Discord talk a little bit more we get comfortable with each other and then they block me without saying anything  both on Discord and on here.

What I don't understand is that they said that they would never block me on discord  and the fact that the same thing happened twice makes me wonder  what is going on  why is Discord and Reddit keeping me from talking to these two. Perhaps I'm just doomed to be lonely forever  I don't deserve love  I'll never be free from the depths of loneliness. I gave up on having a future to fulfill my own selfish desires for happiness  what more do I need to sacrifice.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1jekojw/twice/
loneliness,tired of wanting someone to be around,"I'm 25 and I've just cut ties with someone who was trying to be in a relationship with me. I can't quite explain all the little things that have happened to me while growing up and the things I've experienced with my first love but I know that they've left me damaged.  I have this desire to find someone  I think we all desire to find that one person who makes us feel normal. like maybe even if nothing is okay  it'll be okay knowing that they'll be around. I think maybe it's just being codependent which I realize is wrong. I keep reminding myself  you should love yourself before you hope someone to love you. you should learn to be alone before desiring to have someone by your side. you should be capable of being alone in your own presence and feel peace. somehow it doesn't take away the desire to be desired by someone. it doesn't erase the absence I feel around others. the lack of connection I guess. I have family member around me always although it never feels like they really see me. I mean of course they see me but i don't think they realize the hollow feeling I always carry around with me. I smile and I pretend to be happy and okay but I know I'm not. I feel alone. I feel misunderstood. I've spoken to my mom  about my depression  and she says ""I don't know how you do it  all those thoughts running in your head. just think of happy things and it will be better"". so I do. I try. I can't tell if I'm lonely and depressed or if the depression is causing the loneliness lol... I just feel so tired of being alone. unseen. unheard. misunderstood. I'm tired of wanting to be in a relationship out of desperation of feeling less lonely. tired of being intimate with people to feel a breath of affection thrown my way. then automatically regretting the invasion of my body when I willingly gave it out as a trade for attention or affection or whatever they're willing to give. I'm tired of being tired. Im trying to do my best to be a better daughter  it's the only goal I really have at this time. becoming a stable pillar for my loved ones and it helps but it also reminds me that I don't have anyone looking after my emotions or health. I have to be that for me I keep saying to myself but it's hard. how does anyone stop feeling so lonely? when does it stop feeling like you make obligations for oneself to keep moving forward? when will I finally be happy with myself so I'll stop looking for someone to be there for me? I just feel so alone in this life and I the people I love who are closest to me are also dealing with their own problems.

loneliness,Just some experiences to share,"I've been cut from social connections my whole life. And while I always felt crooked and wrong  only lately I am understanding the actual ""damage"" that this situation causes in my early and late development.
I am an only child; I never had pets; I had relatively absent (but caring) parents; I live near relatives  but this never did much for me  as they are beyond isolationists  meaning I never lived the concept of ""family"" or ""friends"". I barely ever seen people in my house outside of being there simply for work.
I already had some serious predisposition to lack of social perceptions as during almost all school  from very early age  I barely perceived other kids as beings. In fact I always escaped the negligent surveillance of my teachers  leading me to play alone for the vast majority of my childhood  avoiding the authority figure of the situation  learning their movement patterns in order to know where to stay to never be seen (""escapist"" was a playful nick that they gave me for this fact). In the desperate attempt to make me socialize  my mother put me in some summer clubs  but I ended up isolating myself to play with rubik's cubes and puzzle games  avoiding all activities with other kids.

I ended up in highschool being the text book quiet kid that was ostracized by teachers and avoided by others. I went to university and while I've found I place I was passionate about  deeply  I still wasn't able to form any meaningful connection whatsoever with anyone. Many people that report loneliness usually lose friends after university  but I never had anything to lose anyway at the end so I didn't live that trauma.

Despite my absolute inability to form friendships  I was indeed quite able to keep a conversation and I often took dominant roles in groups  being either an admin  a host or a group leader. I ended up not having any particular problem with romantic relationships. Ironically  I had more romantic relationships than acquaintances in my life  as most of the friends I had ended up having a crush on me at some point. This may sound as a flex until you realize how hard it is to lose your only option for a friend as a result of your rejection  which quite often had to arrive.

Most of the people I had a chance with was either ghosted by me for some reason or another at some point or just didn't care enough to stay by themselves. In all the clubs that I joined I always was the one that after years barely had any connection with anyone  despite being there since earlier than others.

Now I am dude approaching his 30 and I can perceive not only how much I never had a chance to form any social connection with anyone  but also how much I never learned to use the social language. Everything requires a vocabulary of simbolic actions  which for the most part are so natural that people don't realize to use  but I grew up overcompensating for the lack of something that only today I understand how much I lack.
I tried therapy  but it proved to be either ineffective or I was straight up abandoned by the institution to begin with (also because of COVID). At the end I ended up being to busy to keep looking for help anyway.

While I am doing a lot of effort to ""put myself out there""  and this is indeed giving me some results  it is truly not enough considering how late I am in my mental development regarding the aspect of social connection  and how hard it is to be provided with a context at this age.
I am not hopeless or anything  but despite how desperate I see many people to be  and their feeling is completely validated  I see in them a frustration which I am not even sure to be able to empathize with. Despite how absurd  abusive and tormented some situations I come across are  not many met the level of persistent internal isolation (and consequently underdevelopment) that I seem to have lived in childhood.

In any case I just wanted to share my struggles without much emotions put into it  for those who may be interested.",7,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1hzbfdz/just_some_experiences_to_share/

loneliness,I don’t have nobody ,"
My name is Anthony Bookman. My wife passed back in may  and ever since everything went down hill we was struggling beforehand but getting by but after her passing it’s 10x worse all we had was each other. She was from the Philippines but moved here with her aunt and her aunts husband which they were practically upper middle class her family over here are doing well. Her side of the family are rich compared to me and my family which I barely have. You see I was born at 6 months 3 months early due to my mother’s crack addiction I was a breach baby I literally stepped into this world ( I came out foot first) she found out she was pregnant with me at 3 months and continued to do what she do. I think she was trying to get me aborted by crack idk lol but I survived. She never told me the truth about my father which I never met because she was ashamed to admit that she was a prostitute. I was the black sheep of the family I’m the middle child and she always treated me differently. My older brother and little brother was never subjected to the beating she gave me. She was so quick to punch me in my face and embarrass me in front of my friends and girls to keep me humble I guess because I don’t look like anyone I’m related to even though we have a very little family members on my mother side. I was always made fun of and told that they found me in front of Taco Bell because I look Hispanic due to my features. I’m black but due to not knowing my father my ethnicity always is questioned and always asked what else I am mixed with and reluctant to say. I was always jealous of my brothers because they have relationships with they father and came around gave them gifts and took them to places but I had to play it off like it didn’t bother me because whenever I asked about my father she would get mad and make it a big thing about it so I had to learn to keep my mouth shut. So naturally to gravitated to the streets looking for acceptance and subconsciously love I never received in the house hold.  When my mother was pregnant with my little brother when I was 15 I got locked up for robbing the pizza man due to it was never no food in the house because my brother was having a baby also at the same time so majority of the time they was eating out and only time they was bringing in food was for themselves so I had to fend for myself which marked me for a lifetime of struggling to find a career because who wanted to hire a convicted? I was charged as an adult btw. I tried to join the military and rejected. I wanted to go to college but didn’t know what I was doing I didn’t know how to fill out the fasfa application so I just gave up and continued down the wrong path. I was given a settlement at 18 due to getting hit by a car when I was 9 and luckily my grandma before she passed when I was 12 set it up for me to get it when I was 18 because my mother is a narcissistic money hungry delusional selfish person who only cares about herself and her house always comes first. When I turned 18 which I was still in high school I moved out and me and my brother got a apartment which I paid for and him and his baby mother moved into and me being so naive and so happy to be on my own I allowed them to take advantage. I gave my nephew his own room and they had a room and I slept in the living room. I helped put me and my brother through driving school and bought my brother a car. My mother was mad because she couldn’t control me since I was out her house even though I have her 2 000 dollars before we even left the bank. I was awarded 20 000 btw which 5 000 had to go to the lawyer that represented me for the robbery case and agreed to wait till I turn 18. One day my mother called me and demanded that I give her 1 000 dollars just cause with a attitude and in reply I said what you trying to pimp me or something and till this day she tells everyone I never gave her anything and say that was my reply when she asked me for money. I was trying to be conservative and didn’t want to run through my money but in 18 months it was gone. I checked my account one day and I only had 1 000 only to find out that my mother was stealing from me it took me 8 years to put it together I must of had a mental block because I didn’t want to believe it but her address was where I was getting checks and my bank information sent to and when I brought it to her attention about my account status and what I should do because I was highly upset and didn’t know at the time about disputing the charges to my account she played dumb and acted like it wasn’t nothing I can do and she didn’t know what to do so it was back to square one. She always allowed my brother and his family to move back in with her but when it came to me I always had to find a way and beg people to sleep on their couch or house which I never was able to get myself together because I always had to find a place to lay my head at which led me back to the street and another conviction of robbery in which I did 2 years prison time of robbing a drug dealer who told on me. I came home sold drugs here and there and at 25 had my first daughter with a girl I barely knew I got her pregnant having a threesome with her homegirl. I was working temp jobs to stay afloat and then two years later I met the love of my life. She was the only person who showed me love and truly cared about me and my wellbeing and I think she had pity on me because of how I would always bend backwards for the people who shitted on me and opened my eyes about the treatment of my family and that isn’t the way i was supposed to be treated. She ended up getting pregnant with our son Aj and it was basically us against the world and at 3 my son was diagnosed with level 2 autism which strengthened our love and relationship even though our relationship was going up and down like anyone else’s. She passed on may 23 2024 and ever since I haven’t been the same. I lost the only person who truly loved me and now it’s just me and him. We currently in a hotel shelter and I haven’t been able to work do to not having no help or be able to afford a babysitter and the time he goes to school it’s hard to find employment in between the time of that. I’m still waiting on ssi for his medical condition and her survival benefits and it’s super hard and stressful. I’m still grieving but I have to stay strong for our son and luckily she has a strong family relationship who loves our son and takes him from time to time and holidays which I’m very grateful because I never had that growing up. Birthdays and Christmas is just another day for me because after my grandma passed that stuff stopped and now I’m basically at my ropes end and don’t know what to do. I donate plasma twice a week so we can eat for the week and our social service benefits which we was barely getting by on was cut in half which is now basically impossible to get through the end of the month on. I’m getting 150 in foodstamps and 300 in cash benefits and my phone bill is 140. I did have a government phone so I didn’t have bill but it was always breaking easy or getting cut off due to the people I sign up with scamming and signing up people with my info causing my phone getting cut off. I went through at least 30 of them phones. My Facebook was recently hacked and it had all of me and my wife memories and the birth of our son so I had to make a new one but hopefully soon I be able to get back into it so I don’t lose it. But long story short if anyone can help that would be greatly help just look up my
Name on facebook I recently made it but my original facebook page is Tone Bookman and you will see I’m not bullshitting or trying to scam people. I’m just trying to get by and don’t know what else to do and got to swallow my pride and reach out hoping someone can help or multiple people so I can get back on my feet and give my son the life he deserves and a better life and love that I never received which I’m doing now. Her family do the best they can they would send me 100 dollars at the end of the month when I ask but I try to not over do it I hit her stepfather around the 15-20 of the month so we can make it until the cash assistance hit on the second but truthfully it’s not enough. If I can get a car I can DoorDash and do much more and be able to keep us afloat. It’s much more I can go into about

loneliness,Hello im Ellie,Today was possibly one of the worst days of my life and  since I had no one to talk to  I came here. I've never done this before and I'm not a social media person  so please forgive me if I'm doing this wrong. First of all  hello  I'm a 24-year-yo woman who has struggled with depression since childhood. After multiple suicide attempts and failed relationships  I began to give up hope until I met someone I loved. For the first time  I began to feel hopeful for the future. I even moved in with him until one day he told me he didn't love me anymore  and it broke me. During that relationship  I distanced myself from all my friends because he didn't like it when I spent time with them and we would fight. After the breakup period i felt so alone and broken. I tried to reach out to them for comfort but I got judged and humiliated  so I cut off all contact. This all happened months ago and I still feel so hurt and alone  especially since it's a reoccurring theme in every relationship I have ever had (me giving it my all and receiving the bare minimum or worse). I guess my question is  how is it so easy for people to cut others off? How is it so easy to move on from friendships or relationships when it's so hard for me to let go? And why do people always leave me? I wish I just had a stable presence in my life  a friend that respects me or a lover that holds on to me or just genuinely someone to talk to that would listen to me.,3,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1gf1b77/hello_im_ellie/
loneliness,I don’t know what I’m doing wrong,"I feel like I’m destined to be alone. It doesn’t matter how hard I try  no one sticks around. I have no one in my life- no one to talk to  no one to laugh with. My phone is so dry  I don’t know why I bother having one. I don’t know what’s so awful about me that means that nobody wants to even be associated with me. 

I’m aware that if you look at my profile and the posts that are on there  I come across as an unhappy and miserable person  but I’m not always like that. I use Reddit to try and express my emotions in a healthy way because I have no one to talk to. When I’m having general conversations with people  I’m much more upbeat. I try my best to take an interest and ask questions to keep the conversation going. I’m always polite  and especially when messaging someone  I’m never pushy about getting a reply. I try to treat the person I’m talking to the way I wish someone would treat me. 

I can’t seem to even keep internet friends. I met someone on this subreddit and we started talking when they sent me a message after seeing one of my posts. We instantly hit it off and really related to one another. I finally felt understood by someone. We talked for almost a year  then suddenly  they stopped talking to me. I hadn’t said anything that was rude or upsetting- we were just in the middle of a conversation. I tried contacting them on Reddit  discord  even their phone number they had given me  but it’s as if they’d vanished. I understand that people have things going on in their lives  but I thought they cared enough about me to have at least said something  even if it was that they didn’t want to be friends anymore. 

There was someone else who I met online that I also seemed to click with. Again  I spent hours talking to them  and really put the effort in  only for them to stop replying a couple of months back. I just wish people wouldn’t get my hopes up. They even said how much they were looking forward to getting to know me better  and that they enjoyed talking to me. I don’t like when people say things like that when they clearly don’t mean it  because it really messes with my head. I know I have to keep putting myself out there to give myself a fighting chance to meet new people  but there’s only so much I can take. The whole process is draining. I don’t want to miss an opportunity due to past experiences not being great  but I don’t want to spend so much time on someone again if they’re just going to ghost me. 

I feel so unwanted and insignificant. I just want to be important to someone  to be wanted  for someone to care so much that they would miss me if I wasn’t around. If I disappeared right now  no one would probably notice  let alone be bothered. I have so much love and time to give to someone  but no one wants anything to do with me. Every night I go to bed wishing that one day I might find somebody else who feels the same. ",10,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1joc72n/i_dont_know_what_im_doing_wrong/

loneliness,I just don’t care anymore,"
The family member and person I cared for the most died in November last year  and ever since  I feel like my life has been slowly falling apart. I’ve felt angry  upset  depressed  frustrated  but I’ve now reached the point where I don’t care. I’ve had my low points before  but never this bad  and it makes me wonder where it’s all going to end. The difference is  this time  I’ve lost all motivation to improve things  because it doesn’t seem like it’s worth the fight.

I feel like I’m at a crossroads in terms of deciding whether to continue or whether to quit  and it’s the closest I’ve ever come to just giving up. The fact I’ve even got to the point scares me. Everyday I’m weighing up my reasons to stay and reasons to go. I’m 24 years old  I shouldn’t be feeling like this. As much as it gets on my nerves when people say  ‘you have your whole life ahead of you’  that is true for most people my age because they can’t wait for the future. I do find it quite sad that I’m questioning whether I’m even going to have one.

I lost my job in late December. Since then  I’ve been stuck at home with no routine or purpose. I’m slowly burning through my savings because I can’t find another job. At the moment  I don’t have a reason to be alive. I’m bringing nothing good to anyone’s lives  if anything  I’m creating problems by just existing and getting in the way. I spend my days and nights bedrotting and doomscrolling social media  which I never would’ve done a few months ago. I try my best to get up  shower  and get some fresh air  but I question why I’m doing it. I will admit that I feel better for it  but when I’m still just existing and nothing more by doing it  it doesn’t really feel worth the effort. I’d love to be able to travel or even just go out for the day for a change of scene  but I don’t have the money to blow on things like that right now. 

Despite being in bed a lot of the time  I can’t sleep. I never used to have a problem with sleeping. It doesn’t come naturally to me anymore and I toss and turn for hours. This past week has been particularly bad. Some nights I’ve been awake the whole night  but then it has thrown the little routine I did have completely out of whack. One night  I fell asleep around 6:00am and didn’t wake up until 5:30pm. I then didn’t want to sleep when it was the appropriate time to  and it just started a cycle of me being tired  irritated  and feeling even more low. Deep down  I know that the reason I don’t want to wake up when most people do in the morning is because I am immediately flooded with thoughts of how the day would’ve panned out if my family member was still here. I thought that if I changed up my routine to something completely different  it might help me forget  but it doesn’t. I don’t wake up with anything to look forward to  all I feel is dread.

I’ve always been lonely and never really had strong friendships or any sort of romantic relationship. My family member was the only one who seemed to understand me  and now she’s gone  and I’ve never felt so alone. I’m not saying this to big myself up  but I’ve always tried to be good to people and help them if I can. I always try to put my best foot forward. I know it’s not obvious from the tone of this post  but I honestly have so much love to give  yet I’m always left behind. The thing is  it’s always me that has to make the first move  no one ever reaches out to me. I’m not greedy- just having one person I could rely on would mean the world to me. I wish someone would come and save me for once. I’ll have days where I feel so low like this  but other days  I feel like I can move forward. But whichever frame of mind I’m in  the loneliness stays. 

I went out a few days ago with the one friend I do have. I used to enjoy the times when we met up  because we would have a laugh and have some good conversations that weren’t surface level. The other day  I felt absolutely nothing. I enjoy my friends company  but I found that I just wasn’t interested in anything we talked about. Of course I want the best for her  but I felt like everything we were discussing didn’t really matter. Everything seemed so trivial. We walked past the place where we both used to work  so we went in and said hi to the people there. Everyone there was really friendly and asked how I was doing. Someone even said that I looked well  which surprised me  because it’s the furthest thing from how I feel. Again  I used to look forward to seeing these people and working with them  but that day  I just felt like a fake  exchanging pleasantries whilst lying and saying everything is fine. I thought it would help getting out of the house and socialising  but it made me feel worse. It was the classic lonely in a room full of people feeling. I desperately want to be around people that get me  but I’d rather be alone if I’m going to end up feeling so isolated.

I feel like I’m watching life from the sidelines. Everyone else is carrying on each day  whereas I feel my life stopped in November. When I’m out in public  I feel invisible  or that everything happening around me is a dream  and I’m just watching a simulation play out in front of me. I’m not a part of anything  and I feel like when I am in a group for whatever reason  I’m there for someone else’s sake and not my own. I can pull myself together for other people- plaster on a fake smile  laugh at the right moments  but deep down  I’m just not me anymore. Everyone thinks that things will work out because I reassure them that they will. In reality  I can’t convince myself of this because I’m crumbing inside. I’ve become a shell of the person I used to be. I don’t voice what I’m thinking or feeling anymore  I find myself having no patience when people are making a big deal over trivial things  and I have no interest in anything.

I seem to have these massive shifts in my mindset. I have days where I feel utter despair  but then I have other days where I’m so determined to change things. I still don’t ever really feel positive  but I have more willpower to get out of the mess I’m in. Yesterday was one of those days  and I was able to focus on getting things done. With every negative thought or regret that came into my head  I managed to turn into fuel to push myself forward in a positive way. It’s so weird. The thing is  despite not caring most of the time  I know deep down  I really do want to make a go of things. What scares me is  on the days where I have this drive  I know I’m desperately holding on to being in a better frame of mind  because I’m dreading what’s going to happen if I go back to thinking negatively  and that I could possibly spiral even further down. I feel like if I let go now  the darkness will take hold  then it’s game over for me. I don’t actually feel good- it feels like a fake it till you make it sort of situation.

Any sort of future I can envision terrifies me. It doesn’t matter what scenarios I come up with- I’m still on my own in every one. I’m past the point of wishing for the future I wanted that I now can’t have  because I know those days are in the past. If I don’t decide my future for myself  those decisions are going to be made for me by people that don’t have my best interests at heart  and I’m not going to let that happen. I feel like someone is stood behind me pushing me closer to a cliff edge  and even though time is running out  part of me is ready for the fall. Just thinking about where I might end up fills me with so much fear. This whole experience has made me realise that I’m completely alone and no one is coming to help. I often feel like running away and disappearing- at least there’s a chance I’d feel free. I can’t be made to feel much worse  that’s for sure. 

I know the key here is change. I need to do something to get myself into a position where I can find happiness again. The family member I lost always said she wanted me to be happy  and as much as I want to achieve that because of her  I honestly don’t know if it’s something that’s on the cards for me. Every avenue I seem to find is either a dead end or it’s a long lonely road to travel alone. I just don’t know whether I can do it.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1iq2yi9/i_just_dont_care_anymore/
loneliness,Everybody In My Life Seemingly Never Have The Time To Truly Be Happy Anymore. Working Constantly And Having To Sleep Off Their Exhaustion Leaves No Time To Have A Proper Conversation. I've Felt Lonely For Many Years Now. I Recently Turned 24 This Month. But I Feel Things Have Just Gotten Tougher.,"I know this isn't a unique point in any way. And frankly I know there is no easy fix. This last year has been an insane rollercoaster of emotions. Where I've desperately tried to keep people close.

But In Fact have let my loneliness allow me to grow bitter with people. I'm lucky not to have let this ruin too many friendships  but one truly amazing friend I lost because of it.

They were an incredible soul with nothing but love to share. And an outstanding artist. If you'd like to check out their Illustrations & Animations. Please look up ey3mzzzs on Insta.

And their Twitch Streams at Nenegrimalkin. They're one of a kind I promise you. I will miss them everyday of my life.

But Anyway. I just wanted to share this to show how loneliness can make you both vulnerable for others to see. But also very unlikeable if you don't learn to handle it right quickly enough.

I've done my best on dating apps and whatnot to keep myself distracted from these overwhelming feelings. But rarely does this have success for me. I've used them since January this year and haven't had a single date.

I've used close to 10 of them everyday. All I get is a single comment here and there. And a small conversation. Before they disappear once again.

I don't believe my profile is the issue. I have been told I'm good looking by other users who've ‘very occasionally’ spoken to me. I show them I'd be happy to talk to them more. Yet this still never goes anywhere. They all lose interest so fast it would seem.

But this likely goes back to my main point on work consuming all our creative  passionate opportunities. Leaving us essentially like slaves  working longer hours to survive off the bare minimum remuneration we receive.

My friends  both in real life and online  are experiencing this more than ever. We used to hang out all day back in College.

And even after that came to an end  we had Dscord to chat in calls and play games together. We all worked back then  but it just felt like we actually used to have time to relax.

But now at 24  adulthood seems to have pulled us apart. Granted some of us live in other places now. One in America  one in Japan  one in Germany  and one in Scotland. But even suggesting a Dscord (Sorry Reddit doesn't like the actual word for some reason) causes such a hefty task for us all these days.

I'm lucky that my job leaves me with more freedom. But honestly  I would give this job to my friends if I could. It would be better for them as they are the most productive  passionate individuals you will ever meet. I would love to see them in a life they can smile in everyday.

So I guess I'm just wondering whether life will ever change from this economic driven society  hell-bent on destroying any chance for creativity to spawn if it doesn't immediately involve lots of money to be made. Normally for other people you don't even know to exploit.

loneliness,What can I do?,"(Sorry for the bad speaking  I don't speak English too well  and I'm still learning it)

Hi  I'm 13 years old  and yes  I know I shouldn't be here  and I should instead talk to my parents about this but I just don't want to Idk why.

Anyway  I have been feeling very lonely recently. I have some friends and a girlfriend but even with that  I feel lonely. Since I was 12 years old  I have been excluded from some events that my friends do. For example  once some of my friends were planning to hang out and watch a movie but they didn't invite me  I'm fine with that but they talked about that in front of me  I just felt excluded  they didn't even consider me to go. After 2 of their hangouts  they finally decided to invite me  but it was kind of forced because in the cinema there were some games in pairs  but they were 5 and one of them was left alone so they needed someone else... Yeah  just for that they invited me.

  
Some years ago  when I was in 2nd or 3rd grade of elementary education I had a group of 3 friends  but well  in that group of 3 there's always an excluded friend and I was the excluded friend in that group. In that moment I didn't see it  until today. Luckily  I tell one of them that I don't want to be his friend anymore  the other one is still my friend and he's my best friend.

  
So  I have been experiencing loneliness since I was younger (but as I said I didn't notice it until today).

 

But the problem now is that I have a group of 4 friends (well 3 friends  the other one is my gf)  and nobody is excluded. One of them is in another school group (I don't know how to say it). So in my school group  we are just 3. We used to sit together but the teacher decided to change the seats of everyone  my friend and gf are now too far away. I'm alone surrounded of people that I haven't met well and I don't plan to (They are all troublemakers and I don’t like to be with them). And well  I feel lonely because of that. I stopped feeling lonely some months ago because I wasn't excluded  my friends were always with me and we did video calls every day to play video games.

  
But now I feel lonely again  it's not just because my friends are in different places  they have started to exclude me again (even my girlfriend but I think that they do it without the intention of doing it  but they are conscious that I'm just sitting alone). And it hurts me to see them talking  joking  and laughing... It really hurts. (BTW  almost every friend I have it's there  just my best friend it's excluded too  and well  we both are good friends of them too but I'm starting to doubt that. But my best friend is the only one that doesn't exclude me.)

  
Also  I have some insecurities about my relationship with my girlfriend but that is about another thing if someone who reads this wants to know you can just ask (Idk why you wanna know but anyway).

  
All this made me think that if I suddenly disappeared from school or something it wouldn't be a great change  I mean  it would be obvious that I'm not there and it would hurt my girlfriend (or it wouldn't hurt her if my insecurities are truth) and my best friend And OBVIOUSLY my family. But ignoring that for the rest of my other friends  it won't be a change  they will just live normally. That made me think about suicide but I forgot it  now I don't think that anymore but sometimes when I really feel lonely I think that again but it goes away quickly.

I know that I could try to make new friends but I'm introverted  shy  etc. So it's quite hard for me to make new friends. Also  I have already met almost everyone in my classroom (not too well but I already know a bit of them) and with most of them  I prefer to not talk with.

  
So here's my question again  what can I do?

  
I came here for help or just to make friends who have experienced loneliness too. I hope that I can be a friend with someone here.

Anyway thanks for reading  if you wanna talk or to answer my question just comment it. Thanks.

loneliness,no one sees me,"i (24f) always feel dramatic saying that i feel like my type of loneliness is different from what others experience and is entirely my own  but i do truly believe that few people know what it’s like to be this lonely. i grew up somewhat socially isolated  i went to public school but the difficulties that went on at home were so overwhelming and all consuming and i couldn’t talk to anyone about it - so i didn’t talk at all. i had selective mutism until i reached high school  but even then i didn’t know how to socialize so i mostly kept to myself. everyone i went to school with had gone to school with me for years  so they didn’t reach out to befriend me and i don’t blame them. i was able to make friends with some newer students but none of those friendships lasted  i still couldn’t talk about my home life and i couldn’t hang out outside of school so they were solely in-school friendships. when i was 18 i pushed through my social anxiety and got a job working retail  and that really changed my life because the one on one interactions with various people and continued interactions with coworkers really brought me out of my shell and made me more trusting and comfortable with people - and slowly but surely  largely through work  i was able to make a handful of friends. 

these friendships were very one sided  because of social niceties i didn’t open up about my trauma until years into these friendships  and the three people i had opened up to told me point blank “that sounds like something you should tell a therapist”. i didn’t even share any of the real horrors  i would try being a little vulnerable and tell people about my struggles and discomfort socializing because i grew up socially isolated  but that was too much for my friends. my friends would tell me detailed stories about horrors they’ve experienced  bullying  fears  mental illness  traumas  and i was a shoulder to cry on and someone who gave support and encouragement and recommendations. but that was never reciprocated. i tried again a few months back  just venting about my new job and how i was stressed because it’s online customer support and customers are often frustrated and take it out on me when they need to talk to customer support. one person i told said “you’ll be fine  you’re you” and the other person recommended i try therapy to learn how to cope. again i didn’t say anything extreme  but that warranted therapy to that person. that person who called me crying every single day about her boss and how she got fired for time fraud. i have tried therapy  i’ve tried the therapy that’s covered by my insurance a handful of times  and every time i am inevitably fired by my therapist. every therapist has heavily recommended that i try different forms of experiential therapy like emdr rather than talk therapy  but it’s not covered by my insurance and i can’t pay for it out of pocket. so i don’t think about therapy anymore. 

i’ve been cutting the few friends i have out of my life because the friendships are so one sided they didn’t even know my last name  or my age  or that i have siblings  which is the one thing i talk about in regards to my family life (because i love my siblings more than anything). i play therapist to my friends and remember everything about them and give birthday presents and try to be what i think a good friend would be  and in return i’m rewarded with them venting to me - because that’s all i deserve  to them  i guess. i actually feel lighter not having these people in my life anymore  they never made an effort to see me in person though i’ve offered so the lack of calls and texts has just given me more free time. but god i am so lonely. the lack of friends didn’t increase that  but with the more time to think i can’t help but think about how awful i must be. people don’t like me or notice me or care about me  i was friends with people for half a decade and they didn’t even know my last name. my siblings are my life but they don’t like when i vent to them or talk about my interests really  so i don’t anymore. i sometimes see videos online about people talking about inside jokes and references with friends and those friends knowing them so well they can make accurate assumptions and describe them. and my friends didn’t know how old i was or even what part of the year my birthday was in. not once have i received a happy birthday. 

i work customer service remotely and there’s no phone line  so i go days without talking until my weekly meeting with my manager and i can stay home all day every day if i want. i haven’t had physical contact in any capacity with another human this year. haven’t had sex in four years  and even then it was only twice as a drunken dating app mistake. i don’t usually touch people except when i worked retail and exchanged money  but i haven’t worked retail in years. no one touches me intentionally and knowing that makes me feel like i am disgusting and vile. there’s something wrong with me i’m sure. i am no one. i am dirt on the floor i am wind in the air i am nothing anyone cares about or sees. i am so lonely i could disappear and no one would notice  and i don’t want that. i want connection and love but i am no one. sometimes the loneliness is all consuming and it feels like i’m not a person anymore. i love music and fashion and reading and comedy and i am passionate and loud  but still no one sees me. i want to be seen.

loneliness,I want to end up my problem,I’m almost at the same situation too  i got asperger and even tho i have a lot of things that i could have in my favor  i don’t really have friends and it’s hard af to socialize with the people that is outside. I used to be very socially past 2 years ago but after i got caught on drugs and alcohol my mental health went straight to the fuck. I got suspended from mid school and afterwards my social skills disappeared   entering high school i felt different and shy at the same time. Even if i have a brand new sports car (an audi ttrs to be more specific)  dress well  athletic  and kinda smart. I don’t really feel like all of those factors could help or people just rejected because of who I am. I’m scared of approaching to new persons and don’t even talk about women. my GPA dropped a lot after the mental breakdown too. In school is like i’m a ghost even tho everyone knows who i am. Because i can’t talk with no body  i haven’t attend to a party of my HS in almost 2 years. I want to change this because i don’t want to be a loner in a last year of HS but idk what could I do,3,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1bmeucz/i_want_to_end_up_my_problem/
loneliness, My ex built me up just to break me,"

This is kinda long so please be patient with me. But in 2022 I met this girl  we'll call her A. And almost immediately I felt a connection with her however I wanted to search for her on social media and didn't because I never knew where to start. Then after weeks I saw her on one of my friends snaps and added her immediately. And before long we talked everyday  then before longer we became a long distance couple. The first few months all the way until April 2023 were perfect and in my excitement I proposed to her. Because we were in love  of course. Well as things progressed with time she would say things or do things that hurt my feelings. Do things that made me feel lonely. And everything we argued about something her parents would insult me and say that I was not good for her. That I was not being a man. And with all of this and my own life included I fell into a depression  where I thought about taking my life because I felt like I wasn't enough. I ran to drugs  alcohol  and eventually another. Because despite me constantly giving to her both financially and emotionally  her family and friends constantly insulted me for my actions when I just wanted reassurance and or equal treatment. So in my ssdnessThen a day came where I told her I was done  and I wasn't happy anymore that I  felt like she didn't love me. A week had passed and before long we talked and said that we both want to rekindle thus. But I never removed the other person from my life  and constantly got images of them even after I showed up to her place again. Then one night she saw them  and she cried to me. And I realized how bad I did by her. Because yes she insulted me  and told me if I was gonna hurt her feelings everything I gave her money don't do it. But honestly I just wanted to see her happy. And she never seemed to appreciate me. So after the breakup we both went our ways  and the last thing i said was that i love you. And i will prove that i only ever wanted her. But everytime I tried she insulted me  belittled me and told me that I hurt her so much. She even let her friend call and berate me about my actions despite by that time I had gave her over 2000$ and stayed through the constant push and pull. Then months had passed and she asked if we could be friends  with a plan to win back her heart  I said yes. So whenever she needed a voice I was there  whenever she needed help I was there with no questions or request. And now as of two days ago. She told me that not only has she started talking to a guy  but that he is just like her and likes everything that she does and he understands her. That he searched for her after she disappeared  the thing that I didn't. And now she is doing all the things that she used to do with me with him  but she still said she wants me to be friends  still even said can I name my kids after you in case they have children. And I am hurt because I forgive her for everything she didn't apologize for  and I forgive her after she told me that she was angry at me for everything other people before me did which is why she didn't do certain things and didn't let me in in our relationship even after I proposed. But she said she still can't get past what I did because she has been there before and things won't change. Which I think is unfair because she let so many people back in their life after they crossed and betrayed her. But despite all the good we had  she said she can't let me in because it would be toxic. Despite after telling her we can't talk anymore she called me the next day to calm her down because her dog was sent to the hospital  and guess who payed for the surgery? All for her to still say  I don't see anything with you. I asked ever. And she said who know what the future holds.

I know I messed up. But do I deserve this?

loneliness,How to meet new people with severe trust issues?,"I Can't figure out why friends betray and abandon me. I had a close friend group of 2 in school and got replaced by someone else.
Met 3 people when i used to go to a private tutoring class but then we just didn't get along  met other pre-meds there but when i offered them to go to a cafe during the break they started acting weird and i immediatly recognized that they didn't want to go there WITH me and then i watched them disappear into crowd  like literally they left me in the middle of the street.
Went on a trip with my 2 bffs and their friends. We got bored and started playing Never have i ever. Me and bff were the only ones left in the end and she pointed out  my biggest insecurity. She said i have never had Acne when in fact her skin was also not quite clear. My other bff gasped. i told her that if she wanted to play games like that then let it be and replied with ""i've never been overweight"" she didn't seem upset at that moment but now doesnt talk to me. I felt a bit betrayed because she knew damn well that i've had acne for years and it has affected me so much that sometimes i would not go outside. Even though my skin is in a better condition it used to be so bad in the past. I don't care what others think of me or if they make fun of me but my bff was not the person who should have mentioned my flaw in front of others. This completely worsened my already existing trust issues. I finally felt comfortable with sharing my weaknesses with close friends but she used it against me just to win a meaningless game.
Other BFF is the only person on whom i can rely. We've been friends for like 14 years and i'm thankful that i have her in my life but i also want to have other friends but for some reason  friendships just don't work out for me. Something is wrong with my personality i sometimes seem too cold and distant but i have never betrayed others. I've been told by my old co-workers that i seem comforting and trustful. I worked quite alot to improve my appearance. I always try to look my best but now instead of being more approachable i seem more intimidating because one can tell that i pay too much attention to my physical appearance.

loneliness,Please dm me  if you’d like to chat. I’d love to talk to someone!,"Hello  I’m 34F and from the UK. Never had any real friends in my life more than accquaintances or work colleagues. Never been with anyone either. 

I’m fine being this way and made my peace with being alone. Although I can’t deny that it’s difficult sometimes  as I have no-one to share things with. I think it’d be cool to find like-minded people here to talk to and connect with. 

If anyone would like to chat  I’d be really grateful - please dm me! Ironically I think I make good company and I’m fun and interesting in my own way. I’m a good listener and would love to get to know someone who has the time and energy to talk to me. 

I barely talk about myself  but I figure I should write something about me - I love animals (more than humans)  especially cats. I’m creative  love art and reading. I work as a pharmacist. I’m a nice person  kind  friendly  and considerate.

Not at all expecting anything from this really  I think most likely this post will disappear into the thousands of ofher posts. 

It would be absolutely amazing if one person did want to speak with me though! So I have abit of hope at least  it would mean the world to me!

loneliness,I feel so tired. Is this how my life is going to be?,"Is it always going to be like this?


I'm 22. I recently lost my parent in a really traumatic way. I miss them so much. They were the only person who ever cared about me in my entire life. I feel their absence everyday. I see the things they left behind and cry every day. I remember how everything happened. I can't get those images out of my mind. I'm completely alone now.

I'm just so lonely. I'm extremely boring and because of that when people get to know me they just slowly stop hanging out with me. I live alone. I don't have parents. No one likes me. I can't change my personality.

It's been like that since always. I have 0 friends. I never had a single friend in my entire life  even in my childhood I never had a friend. 

After losing my parent. I recently moved to this new place. People used to sympathize with me at start and used to talk to me.

 I used to hang out with these people. I tried really hard to socialize with them. But after knowing that how boring i'm  they've Started to exclude me now. They hang out without me now. They used to call me outside but not anymore. I don't want to insert myself in a group where i'm not wanted or needed. I feel like they have more fun without me.

I hear the sounds of their laughter and talking while I'm inside feeling lonely  crying and missing my dead parent. They know i'm alone inside alone they just don't care.

The cherry on top is that i'm poor too. I don't have any money. I can't do anything even if i want to. I literally don't have money for it. I'm barely getting by.

Everyone has a family around me. I hear them talk. I feel so jealous. Everyone has someone they can talk to  someone who cares about them. 

I have no one  literally no one who cares about me. It's been days since i last talked to someone and the last time i talked to someone was when i was buying groceries  yeah it was the cashier. Lol. Oh and i live in a third world country  did i mention that.

I don't feel like eating. I don't want to do anything. I don't want to get up every morning to do nothing all day. 
I want someone to care about me. I want to care about someone. I want someone to talk to. I go outside but nothing ever happens. I'm so uninteresting that no one wants to know me and when they get to know me they just leave. I want to stop crying. It physically hurts now.

Anyway if anyone read this till now  thank you so much.

I am just ashamed of myself.. I have noone. My dad died last year.. my birthgiver on the other hand who I live with is an abuse piece of ... (not gonna call names although I would want to say so much bad shit about this person.. ugh feel like vomiting)... literally traumatized by her. I believe that she is a narcissist. 

Anyways.. regardless of that I can't find to seem joy in life anymore. Everything is draining me. Feel like a piece of fat shit and am afraid of loosing my muscles that I have built. I have already not been active at all for about 2 weeks I believe and I just hate this feeling of loosing my strenght  rusting and becoming weaker and weaker.. 

I did watch lots of movies the past week being in another depressive episode again  which I am still in..  and watching some funny videos here and there laughing but I am still being tormented in my insides by everything that has happened to me and the pain I am feeling..
I genuinely don't know if I can keep existing anymore. I have no energy to make new friendships.. I am scared of people.. scared of abuse or being threatened and treated like garbage.

The fact that I also crave love and compassion AND on top of all of that am a fuckin human being is so disgusting to me. I just want to vanish and have never existed in the first place. My birthgiver should have just gotten an abortion and that would've been best for me and probably for her too. I hate the fact that I am saying this but man I am hurt.

Noone wants me or needs me. Makes no difference if I am not here anymore. I do have my uncle (my dads brother) and a good friend of mine but man I ultimately don't give a shit if they suffer if I really decide to kill myself.. this is my life and I can do whatever the fuck I want. Why am I even here?! I just want this knife sticking through my chest to be gone. I can't live with it like this anymore. 

On top of that I can't seem to find a job.. been only getting rejections and my money is running out..
Luckily from tomorrow on I'll partially be in a psych ward... hope this will help but I still feel so lost. I don't know if it'll make a difference. After my 1 to 2 month stay there I will have to have a job and man I just don't think I can do it. If I just were financially secure and had a loving home (instead of a sick toxic place) things would be so much better for me.. 

I hate being an adult.. I just feel like a lost small boy.. no matter how old my body is my spirit will always be a small young boy running wild in his dreams..

Idk Idk Idk...

Idk man.. I am really lost here. Whatever.. 
I am just lost.. forever..

Edit: So it seems that it'll take a little longer until I can go to the psych ward. Hopefully no later than a week but it's also not promised so yeah.. this is not good. Gotta have to deal with this fucked up pain till then..",13,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1g4v5rt/i_hate_my_life_and_want_to_end_it/
loneliness,This loneliness is killing me from the inside and i don't know how longer i can take it,"I am 21M  and i have really been struggling with the romantic aspect of my life since i can remember. I have always thought of myself to be a very likeable person  i always know how to make people laugh  i'm constantly told i'm smart  i'm in great shape because i workout regularly and i always try to keep my higiene on pristine condition. However  since middle school i have always struggled with my love life  because ever since i started taking real interest in girls my age i am always rejected  the first years it was not a big deal  i used to think that this was just a one time occurrence and that'd be it  but ever since i think i have tried flirting with at least 10 girls and all of them had the same reaction  whenever i made my intentions clear they always either rejected me or started ghosting me.

I'm not gonna lie  there's a finite number of rejections i can take before i start doubting everything about myself  some of those girls said some really hurtful things about me that little by little started deteriorating my self-steem. Every time i take interest in a woman i always convince myself that this time is going to be different  but it always ends up the same; she loves spending time with me  looks for ways to be with me  starts the conversation  etc. But whenever i try to ask them out on a date or something similar  i always get the same rejection from all of them  i just don't understand how people can be so affectionate and close to me  but then almost feel repulsed by me when i try to take things further.
I am on my early 20's so friends my age are already dating  enjoying their love/sex life  getting into relationships  having girls try to fliirt with them  but i don't get to do any of that  i don't understand  am i not worthy of love? Am i that ugly? Is it because of something else?
Everyday that passes i just feel more awkward in my own body  i don't understand why i don't get to live a life like people my age  i'm 21 years old and i still don't know what it's like to have someone love me  to recieve a hug from someone who likes me  to kiss or even be intimate with a person. I feel extremely excluded and it feels like all my attempts at improving the situation are useless  every single time i talk to my close friends about a girl i'm starting to know they always try their best to help me  but the result even after their help is always the same.

loneliness,Lonely for Seemingly No Reason,"Hallo hallo!

So I kind of just want to vent out my feelings and maybe I can be lonely with all of you.

Basically  I feel lonely despite seeming like I have a lot of friends. It's a weird feeling for me because I heard this is something extroverts experience. Maybe I became an extrovert in college  I don't know  but I essentially know a lot of people to the point that people I seemingly don't know say hi to me in the hallways.

It might seem like I'm so lucky to have so many friends and acquaintances  but it feels like I'm all alone in a crowded room. They know of me  but they don't know me  and when I want to deepen the relationship  I end up pushing people away. I had people telling me I'm too much. Someone told me they can handle me online  but they can't stand me in real life. It probably has something to do with me being bipolar. I'm like a puppy on rollerskates and the only people I feel understood by are people with ADHD (not even people with bipolar disorder)  but even then  I don't have a lot of interests in common with the people I know with ADHD.

I also have a best friend  but she's hanging out more with her other friends. I feel like she prefers to be with them. I kind of feel like I'm lagging behind. We're also drifting apart in terms of our interests  so that probably contributes to why she'd rather hang out with other people.

I kind of just want to be friends with people with the same interests as me \*and\* who will put in as much effort as I give. My relationships tend to be one-sided. I keep getting hurt because I keep investing in people who won't give me anything back. And it's not like I go to these relationships expecting to be showered with everything under the sun. Even just a small ""hello""  unprompted; an invite to call on Discord and talk about the most mundane things; an invite to play games or watch shows; maybe talk about our thoughts and feelings sometimes  then laugh at a meme the next second. I want someone who is kind to me because they like spending time with me and aren't there to get something out of me or exploit my desire for a connection. I just want a friend  but I feel like all I am is an afterthought.

But I will say  for anyone who feels like anything I said resonates with them  I'm still optimistic. Maybe not today or tomorrow  but we will find our people. Just be careful not to fall down a rabbit hole of misery and bitterness. It’s easy to fall into spaces that reinforce negativity  where bitterness and resentment fester rather than heal. As much as I like the internet  for example  I know it is filled with echo chambers that can make us feel temporarily validated but ultimately trap us in cycles of self-doubt and cynicism.

Remember  you are not unlovable. You are not ugly. You are not unworthy. We all need love  and we can find the connection we desperately crave. We just need to look at the right places. The world is vast  and there are people out there who will see us for who we are—flaws and all—and embrace us wholeheartedly. It may take time  and it may require stepping outside our comfort zones  but meaningful relationships are possible. I've seen it happen  I felt it once before  and you can too. No matter how lonely or lost we feel  we are not beyond love. We are not invisible. Everyone needs and deserves connection. Take care of yourself until the time comes. Exercise  eat healthy  sleep well  go to a therapist  and indulge in your hobbies. We got this.  
  
Here's to making friends we haven't met yet.",0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1jjsy9x/lonely_for_seemingly_no_reason/
loneliness,She mean everything to me...,"

A year ago  I met someone who changed my life. We met on Instagram  and from the very beginning  we formed a special connection. We talked endlessly  sharing everything—our thoughts  our dreams  our stories. She wasn’t just a friend; she was my role model  my hero  the person I admired the most.

Over time  our relationship changed. There were moments when we talked less  when we drifted apart for no particular reason. But even when she wasn’t as present  she still meant just as much to me. She made me want to be a better person; she taught me that attachment could be real.

Then  one day  without warning  she left. She blocked me without explanation. I tried to understand why  and all I found out was that she had met someone else—someone jealous  who didn’t want her talking to other guys.

What hurts the most isn’t that she left. It’s that she told someone I was “annoying as hell.” I thought she cared about me…

But despite everything  I can’t be mad at her. Because deep down  I still love her  and I only wish her happiness. Maybe one day  our paths will cross again. Maybe we’ll finally have that hug we always talked about.

If you ever read this… thank you for being my favorite human  thank you for all  love you.

loneliness,I fucked up,There was this girl I was talking to. The first one I had talked to in a while. She lived farther away  even though I met her in my home town. We FaceTimed and I visited her. She fucked me over bad and it destroyed me. It turns out she has very narcissistic tendencies. I’m not saying everything that happened is her fault. I very much take a chunk of the blame here. But ever since  I guess we have both been playing small games. But it has ended with me even angrier than before. I blew up on her after finding out she’s got a new boyfriend while she’s been playing games with me. I guess it’s just not typical of me to let anger take over like that. I have never sent someone a text that bad before. I’m just so hurt about how bad she fucked me over. I feel so terrible for the outbursts  but my mind craves revenge so bad.

loneliness,I'm enclosing myself and I don't know how to get out,"Hello everybody. For a bit of context  I'm a University student currently on an exchange and for that reason I am away from my country. I have been here for half a year now  and the first semester was incredible: I met really good people and made an awesome group of friends. The problem came when they left. You see  these friends were only staying for the first semester and so they have all already left. Since they were the ones taking me to do stuff  the past few weeks I have done nothing other than eating  sleeping and playing online DnD. 

The worst part of all is that having this friend group made me grow a bit apart from the group that I have here on my apartment (I live on a student acommodation) so I essentially don't form part of their group now. I also messed up one time because they invited me to hang out for a while but was in a DnD session in that moment. From that point on  they didn't invite me anymore  even though I told them to please include me  they forgot to tell me on subsequent plans.

I have tried going out and try new things and have met new people  but they have their own things and groups. This has essentially made me resent even leaving  so that adds up to everything in the worst way.

I also really want to tell my family  but they are really far away and that would worry them too much (I'm already worrying them because my responses to their calls are becoming really vague  since I'm not doing anything here)

One thing that could help is that I have a single  trustworthy friend here. The thing is that I have hurt this friend not too long ago and don't want to trauma dump on them now of all times (we still have to talk about what I did). Also  this friend of mine has their own group  but I don't really want to intrude.

All of this is making me really scared of even leaving my room  and to add insult to injury  it's also what is making me feel even more down and disgusting. My room is a mess. I'm not studying at all. I'm just laying in bed all day  without Will to do nothing at all. The only reason I'm going out of my room is to attend my classes.

I know this is really long and not a lot of people will read this  but I really do not know what to do.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1iou7dk/im_enclosing_myself_and_i_dont_know_how_to_get_out/
loneliness,39M I’ve never felt more alone ,"
I'm 39  and  I am in exact same situation -- never had a girlfriend  had sex  never even kissing a girl. I'd be happy to give some insight straight from the horse's mouth. from time to time  and if you're in the know and can identify with a certain lived experience  it's easy to observe when someone is on the spectrum. I've always gleaned that from peoples mannerisms  my obsessive interests (video games and classic rock)  and my way of speaking (tone of voice  tendency to overenunciate words) that i have an autism spectrum disorder -- possibly diagnosed. Having autism is more than enough to render yourself as women-repellant just by sheer virtue of existing  without the upbringings that most autistic men have to suffer from. And even though a lot of what Bo is saying here are conjectures  his predictions on a lot of points I would say are pretty spot on. I could talk forever about the upbringing that got me here  but I'll try to distill it into a few essential cliff points: I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome when I was 13 years old when my grandparents noticed I couldn't make eye contact with people and had sensory processing issues that kept me from eating  as I would throw virtually everything I was fed right back up. My mother was the dominant parent in my household -- my dad wasn't around  but always seemed more interested in doing drugs. He was in and out of prison my whole childhood and then finally 3 years ago broke into my apartment and stole from me. than spending any quality time with me or the rest of my family. He was a negligent parent and bordered on abusive at times.He messed up the chance when I was 14 to have a stepmom yet again because of his drug problems. I had no other key male figures in my life except my grandfather  and had no brothers or male cousins (at least ones that were my age and lived close to me) -- I am an only child and all of my close cousins were female. I found sports boring as a kid  which made it hard to relate to my father and other boys at school. This plus the autism led to me being bullied pretty much my entire life going through school. I was also precocious as a child  known for being more developed in the intellectual/cognitive side of things than other kids my age. I always read/wrote several grades higher than my grade level. This caused teachers (and older people in general) to take bigger notice of me than the other kids  which meant I was watched like a hawk constantly and couldn't take the risks and missteps that other boys my age could get away with. I would be punished  called out  and reprimanded for doing way less than other boys  and this was a pattern that continued well into adulthood. This doesn't even begin to go into my history with girls. I never even had to ask out girls in school to become aware of my low value -- it was always something that other kids would bring up on their own accord and situations that I would be pulled into by them that reinforced that fact. I never started trying to date until university and even then  it was only a few half-hearted attempts here and there. Nowadays  I can give off a positive impression and seem to do ""okay"". I've haven't wanted to go to the gym because i don't want to see all the happy couples with their normie happiness shoved in my face because i have seen this pain in my face for 6 years working in retail let me tell you it hurt so bad everyday i would get up for work i would feel so drained to have to endure that pain daily to have to interact with the general public seeing something i will never have again is like dying a thousand deaths. I am bald now i miss my hair but it is what it is. I grow a beard or goatee even now that I'm almost 40. I am currently working a job in security making decent money and living on my own with totally alone -- though I am at a kind of crossroads point in my career where I will have to to betterr myself and work my way up in my current company which i have never been given the chance in my entire life up until now.if I want to stay healthy. It is a data centerr security job that is very easy and when i worked in retail was very taxing on my mental and physical health  so I probably won't stay ""attractive"" for long if I continue to work this job. So I'm now finally at a point where I could date and have some success if I was willing to put myself out there.... And I don't. Why? Because I just don't care enough to. My upbringing has completely killed my spirit  and I am finding myself at a point where I'm just finding it so hard to want to try. Throughout the entirety of my life  I've been made to feel as if the realm of sex  and dating  and relationships was a parallel society that I was never allowed to be a part of. It's almost a universal experience where the periods of middle school and high school and college are permitted as this period of discovery where people have their first experiences really gauging their worth in that arena  being attractive and being sexy and being charismatic and getting to share themselves with the opposite sex in an environment and consciousness that's carefree with little strings of attached. I never got to have that throughout that point in my life. That affirmation only came afterwards  as I got into my 20s i had made a mistake by meeting all the wrong women and even had a child with the wrong woman which i was never ready to be a father my daughter which is now 13 i haven't seen her in 7 years since by grandmother passed away and my last relationship was about to be on the rocks because my ex blamed me for not working even though she set the trap of telling me to not to work for 3 summers in a row and as a love sick fool i fell for it and it ultimately was my own down fall and fault being so emotional invested into someone who didn't return the feelings i had for them. and all of my peers had already built their confidence and success in that area. It makes me feel like I'm living a lie  where the lessons that I have had to learn from my upbringing were never real. And to me  that isn't fair. I feel so ashamed for not being able to develop in that way at a normal timeframe  at the same time that most people get to discover themselves and flourish. It wouldn't feel right for me to start now; it would all just feel like a big cope. Especially given that most days  it's hard to even just get up in the morning. I am so dead inside. After all  back in high school  the prospect of me even being seen with a girl was so ridiculous and offensive to people that even asking a girl out was out of the question. I don't deserve it. I'm not entitled to it. I was never owed it like all my peers were. I was disgusted. I was a creep. And when I'm made to feel that way without doing anything to anybody  I don't tend to take it lightly. I have a very hard time letting things go  and ultimately that is what has to change if I want to stop rotting in this situation. No amount of money  or gym  or confidence will fix that. I need serious help. And here we have a self-fulfilling prophecy.",9,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1h7org3/39m_ive_never_felt_more_alone/
loneliness,I want someone to talk to me while I fall asleep ,"I was unable to fall asleep for the last few days.

loneliness,I feel like giving up ,"I've probably gone through CEN which has completely messed up my life. I'm 16 and from the age of 14 I've been experiencing intense loneliness  on and off depression  porn addiction. I've lost interest in everything  in every hobby of mine  studies and everything. I'm in 12th grade now and I'm not even studying! People say 12th grade is important for your career and college but I just don't the energy to study. I don't even have the energy to get out of my bed  to brush my teeth. 

I crave for love  someone to see me  understand me and appreciate me soooo much. I can't even explain. Sometimes I just spend nights crying just because of this and sleep around 4-5 am  waking up with swollen eyes. I have no friends I can turn to  my relationship with my parents is not good. They don't understand anything that I do  they don't appreciate me for the good things. They always keep talking about themselves  their likes  dislikes and just themselves. They don't even know who I am as a person. They don't know who their son is  his personality and all. 

My low self-esteem and perfectionism makes things even more harder. I don't find joy in my hobbies and interests anymore like playing guitar. Just holding guitar in my hands makes me tear up. Makes me feel heavy in my chest. My social skills are not good at all. I'm like an outcast in my high school with no friends. No one understands me  no one sees me. Why? Because I don't keep scrolling fucking instagram and play games all day like them. My personality is completely different from everyone maybe because of how I was raised. Just being alone in my head. Socializing is so hard for me  the fear of rejection and all  even my friends poke me that I'm an asshole I can't even be confident in front of them and all. I just can't explain how hard it is  spending all these years alone locked inside your home and then you imagine that when you'll get into teenage  everything will be alright but then you realise that everyone is so different from you and you don't have the skills  you've developed so many fears over all these years that it feels impossible. Loneliness is my main problem because it stems from my childhood and it feeds all the other. 

I've tried my best to control myself. Meditated for hours  journaled  tried a bunch of things out but nothing helps. Wish there was magic in this world so I could've felt better instantly. I'm still here and I haven't taken my life because I still believe someone will help me get through this. I don't think this belief is gonna last long.

I have come to the realization that the same things that have stopped me from making friends in-person  are the same things that have stopped me from making friends online.

loneliness,Self absorbed,I find that loneliness mostly comes from being self absorbed. When you are trapped in the “I” you think only of yourself. You think “why am ‘I’ unhappy  why am ‘I’ suffering” yet you don’t think about others. Friends family relationships etc can only develop when you think more broadly. Get out of your head and into the world. Focus not on what makes YOU feel better but how can you make OTHERS feel better. If you have a past trauma(s) or insecurities holding you back then address them  otherwise it will only hinder you. Stop being so ego driven and needy  you’ll find that connection will come easier.,5,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1i0zg5o/self_absorbed/
loneliness,Can't make it on my own any longer,"My (41 F) life in a nutshell:

I grew up in a dysfunctional family with physical and mental abuse. Was bullied at school. Started drinking and taking drugs as a teenager.

In my mid-twenties  I found a spiritual community that helped me out of that lifestyle and a few years later  I left my home country and moved to a place where this community is more active. Lost contact with all of my old friends.

Have always been struggling to fit into society  dropped out of university and got a job but burnt out in my early 30's. Was diagnosed with autism and adhd around that time. Also ended up homeless  was moving around a lot between 2014 and 2018 with no place to rest while also suffering from major depression and serious fatigue. Got no support from my family  they only carried on with mental abuse so I cut off ties with them.

Got disability pension 2018 at the age of 35. Found a decent place to live but also isolated myself totally since then. Was also in a destructive relationship  ended it in late 2019 since he threatened to beat me up and kill me. Then pandemic happened and I got even more isolated.

Left the spiritual community last year since I found out they're a cult; got no real support from them whatsoever  they just manipulated me into thinking that all negative things happening to me are my own fault and result of my past actions  and there was nothing I could do about it and that I was on my own. Got contact with some cult survivor groups and made close friends with one person online. Soon we developed romantic feelings to each other and since a couple of months or so we've been in a long distance relationship. He's been my everything since then but just like me  he suffers from ptsd and has since 10 days or so behaved very weirdly. Isolated from the rest of the world  hardly responding to my messages and when he does  it takes nearly one day or so.

I think I'm having a mental breakdown  I'm nearly suicidal. What's the point of going on with life? It's only been a series of tragedies and I seem to make terrible mistakes all the time. Have zero friends I can rely on and I'm too broken to make it on my own. Thought that me and my boyfriend (or maybe I should consider myself single at this point?) would have supported each other and start a new life together but it seems he's not on the same page anymore. I just can't cope with him disappearing  not giving me any kind of validation or showing any signs that he wants to communicate with me and sort things out. So on top of all this  my heart's also broken now.

After a life like this  how can I carry on without family or friends or anyone to rely on? I just want to give up",2,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1jmo7da/cant_make_it_on_my_own_any_longer/
loneliness,Help with loneliness,"Hello. I'm 37 years old and truly feel ready for life to finish. Everyday I experience loneliness and regardless of what I do I can never shake that feeling. For years  I had this belief that one day I would find love but after that delusion started fading away a couple of years ago  I've never been the same and slowly descending. That delusion kept my hopes up my whole life when I got my heart broken each time. I can get dates and even had relationships but I always went with women I truly didn't love in hopes that maybe that feeling would change. In the end  it didn't and both of us ended up feeling worse. It was a learning experience for me. Unfortunately I've never had a girl that I like  like me. I looked into a lot of self improvement and just being myself but no matter what I did  it truly felt like I was cursed. 

I exercise 3-4 days a week  go on frequent walks  tried making friends at work and social events  tried social and dating apps but nothings helped my mental health. I've even moved twice in the last 3 years in hopes that a new town would re-energize my life. When I finish work  I find myself sometimes just staring at my tv screen and walking around my house as I'm starting to lose my desire to enjoy the hobbies I used to enjoy. Most of my friends I still keep in touch with but they are often busy with their families.

loneliness,**HELP** I'm feeling abandoned by my mom (adult daughter),"Maybe this will find someone who experienced something similar...
My mom and I used to have the most amazing bond a daughter and mother could have. When my parents separated my younger brother and I didn't even need time to think and decided to stay with her. Our relationship with our dad was very bad because he didn't show as much interest in us as we hoped he would. However things changed when she met her new husband and even though he's an absolute family man and we're very grateful that our mom is happy again she started to make her new life bigger and bigger. After moving out with her from our childhood house she decided to move in with her partner and at the age of 19 I had to live with having my own household and also living with my brother. She came over once a week and supported us financially but I missed her a lot. One day I got hit by a car and ended up in the hospital and she didn't came to visit me because she was living 40minutes away and I was actually doing okay. I had a broken shoulder and got very lucky but still wished that she would care enough to rush to the hospital and see me. We tried seeing each other once a week (including my grandma and aunt) but I quickly felt like spending time with her emotionally drained me and I could barely join their conversations. She also makes sure to meet up with me and my brother but that always end up being a conversation between both of them and I started to feel left out. I really tried to enjoy the time with her and be chatty but as soon as I felt like she's doesn't care as much about my life as she used to a few years ago it started to hurt me badly. My brother is about to move in with his girlfriend and being the single person in my family is annoying but since my friends all started to have families and barely have any time to meet up I feel like I'm missing her even more. Even my attempts of inviting her over to my place end up disappointing me because I feel like shes answering me but is really not actually listening. (For example: This Christmas I really wished for a pink Instax Polaroid camera and she answered: ""Is that your favorite color?"" and I smiled. She first bought me a kids camera because she thought that I wouldn't use it as much but since that really wasn't what I wished for she bought me the camera I showed her but in a completely different color. I was disappointed because I was really looking forward to specifically have the pink one but didn't want to be ungrateful or make her feel bad. I ended up buying the pink one by myself and keeping the other one in my closet. I'm 28 years now and sometimes I questions if that's just a normal thing and if I'm being childish but every time I spent time with her or notice that other women my age still have the close relationship with their mom that I once had I really feel hurt and start to overthink. I love her very much and I want her to have the best life she could possibly have but I really wish I would stop feeling abandoned by her. Even my father and I ended up talking things out and having a good relationship now but every time I try to talk to her about my feelings she barely has any time for me because her husband is waiting for her at home or whenever I tell her that I'm emotionally struggling she kinda brushes it off like she actually thinks I'm fine. Since then being with her is emotionally draining me and I always end up being disappointed even though I know that she still loves me. I just want her to actually start being interested in me again and actually listening and thinking about what worries me or what plans I'm having for my life. I'm 28 but I'm still her child and I don't want to think that she's done caring about being an important and present person in my life.

loneliness,Hello im Ellie,Today was possibly one of the worst days of my life and  since I had no one to talk to  I came here. I've never done this before and I'm not a social media person  so please forgive me if I'm doing this wrong. First of all  hello  I'm a 24-year-yo woman who has struggled with depression since childhood. After multiple suicide attempts and failed relationships  I began to give up hope until I met someone I loved. For the first time  I began to feel hopeful for the future. I even moved in with him until one day he told me he didn't love me anymore  and it broke me. During that relationship  I distanced myself from all my friends because he didn't like it when I spent time with them and we would fight. After the breakup period i felt so alone and broken. I tried to reach out to them for comfort but I got judged and humiliated  so I cut off all contact. This all happened months ago and I still feel so hurt and alone  especially since it's a reoccurring theme in every relationship I have ever had (me giving it my all and receiving the bare minimum or worse). I guess my question is  how is it so easy for people to cut others off? How is it so easy to move on from friendships or relationships when it's so hard for me to let go? And why do people always leave me? I wish I just had a stable presence in my life  a friend that respects me or a lover that holds on to me or just genuinely someone to talk to that would listen to me.,3,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1gf1b77/hello_im_ellie/
loneliness,I just don't like people,"Can anyone empathize? 

  
I usually can't stand people talking to me. I just don't want them to talk to me  I'd rather they shut up. Often when someone starts a conversation  I try to end it as soon as possible and crawl back into my loneliness. I find people annoying  boring  ridiculous  belonging to another species (or perhaps I belong to another species)  unloving and not really interested in me as a person. I often feel almost completely disconnected from other humans.  
  
I only approach people when I need them  like when I have to talk to my mother  my professors  or my colleagues. But I'm not a selfish person. I give them back when they need me. I just can't enjoy their company  so I try to keep my interactions at minimum. I can't even pretend like some people do. I'm sort of socially inept so I sometimes fail to fake enough interest or friendliness that passes as socially acceptable.  
  
That said  I still crave human interactions. I make short scenarios with imaginary or real people on my mind whenever I feel the need to. They serve as temporary solutions to my loneliness. I can stand the people in my daydreams because I make them  and myself  the way I want them  and myself  to be. I wish I could stop daydreaming but I also fear I might turn into a real iron robot without them.  
  
I can clearly see the huge negative impact of having too little social interactions on my life  but what can I do? What's the point of seeking something I can't tolerate? Did I say dislike? Perhaps there's more to it than simply dislike. Despise? Fear? Apathy? I'm not sure. All I know is that I certainly didn't feel like this when I was younger. Certainly not at 18. I always had trouble making friends and maintaining friendships  but I wasn't as broken as I am now. Perhaps at some point I just gave up.  
  
I hate myself for saying this but I don't like my only friend. There. I finally said it. I don't even like my own friend of 9 years and I'm secretly glad that we haven't physically met for a long time even though we message each other almost daily. I've been struggling to admit this fact to myself for a while. Did I say I hate myself for saying it? I might be wrong. I probably don't hate myself for that and don't feel guilty about it either  just make sure it remains a secret.",5,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1gssbyg/i_just_dont_like_people/
loneliness,Mind is a broken glass,"I'm a 34 year old guy. I live in Hungary  Europe. English is not my native language  but I'll try my best to get across my story.

My wife sleeps next to me. It's 10:36PM here  It's late  I'm tired  but still I fear sleeping. Why?

Because every single time I go to bed and try to take nap or an all night's sleep  my mood gets a complete reset. Let me explain:

I've been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) + Bipolar Disorder (BD) around 8 years ago  spending several months at a special hospital treating BPD. Even back then I've noticed how my mood changed drastically after sleep. 

I know  you might be thinking ""but this guy has a wife! She must have plenty of talks  attention  sexy time on his hands!"" - no way he's lonely! No  dear reader  sorry  but no  this is not so simple. Ever since the start with my wife  it's been a horrible ride  mostly because of my extremely low self-esteem  my general inexperience with women  and my jealousy towards my future wife. 

After a pretty sad and lonely upbringing  I ended up being even more lonelier: I was a complete outsider at age 18yo  instantly leaving the school and ending up at manual labour  supporting my family. 

Thinking back  I literally had zero goals  zero hopes towards the future  I was dreaming about ending it all since I was a young kid  constantly abused. 

Now I've reached the 8 year mark with my wife (only married since August last year  but been together for 8 years)  and I have to finally arrive at the sad conclusion that my soul  with all my past sins  all my past wrongdoings  all the hurt  the pain I've caused and every. Single. Moment. I've hated in my life  that just can't be fixed by anyone! 

After years of therapy  years of seeking and taking professional help  doctor after doctor  advise (and meds) after another there's no fixin' a soul which is completely and utterly broken. 

You CAN feel lonely if you're stuck in your past and you can't move on! 

First  you have to love yourself. That's something I just can't do. I've caused the divorce of my parents  then I've caused even more pain for years while I was an alcoholic.

Even though I've been sober for almost 6 months now and not even thinking about breaking the habit now  it's just hard when I feel like slipping away mentally. 

My mental health is rapidly declining  and nobody cares  most people around me are just upset  like why I bother them with my negativity? 

While I suffer. Man  how I wish I could forget the past! How I wish I could forgive that little kid that was me for his weakness! For not defending himself back then! 

I might have a wife now  but I live in fear of losing her. I wish I could just appreciate the present and move past... The past. 

One thing I know for sure by now is that there won't be any outside help. I either defeat my mental illnesses quickly or I'll end up losing everything.

loneliness,Just feel like a burden,I'm normally a quiet person  but when people come to me  I tend to give an empathetic ear and they love coming to me because of that . Sometimes they get close n they want to also help yet they don't know as I'm helping them fix their pieces   I'm a fuckin mess. I rarely tell people about my frustrations because I know it's overwhelming to put that on a person   it's just that recent I made two close friends I'd actually open up to  they'd come to me n open up and I help them. I guess they started feeling like they needed to reciprocate so they started asking about me  I opened up about my struggles n suddenly they started acting colder towards me after a while  they'd ignore any deep conversations with me. They are less available than they used to be. It just hurts because I finally thought I found people that would understand me but seems I'm too broken for them and I overwhelmed then by telling them the truth about my actual wellbeing.  I feel so lost and lonely  it hurts  I was okay being alone n now I'm exposed n attached   I really wish they didn't try getting close to me if they were just going to get burdened by what I go through .

loneliness,Have a huge change of lifestyle that is making me feel lonely. HELP NEEDED,"My loneliness is very hard to quantify it differs for everyone also differs in different situations. If I'm in a large group of people then my loneliness would be 10  but if I've been alone for 7+ days without human contact my loneliness would be 1.

Now I'm looking at retirement next year and I realise that I don't have any family or real friends anywhere in the world. I've never been married  I'm an only child and my last living relative died from old age 15 years ago. I'm only retiring because I'm sick of the structural changes to the way of reporting expenses my employer implements every few years. Plus I'm starting to get some medical issues now I pass my 60th birthday last year. I celebrated my birthday on the company jet flying across the Indian Ocean. 

In my retirement I either need to buy a home in a unknown town or buy a motorhome I can drive around the world. In my 40 year career I've traveled to most countries and areas in our amazing world. I have spent more 30% of my time in an aeroplane in 40 years the longest time I've spent in one city is 25 days  now I'm not sure if I can settle down. 

I don't have any hobbies as they're hard to work on when traveling as much as I did  but I'm interested in exploring woodworking. I've designed a portable workshop so that isn't going to be a problem that would make me settle down  however I realize that it could be an opening to make some friends. 

This is making me feel lonely or maybe it's fear of the unknown  but whatever it is I'm unsure about my future. I don't know weather to settle in a town then try to make friends or stay alone forever. ",3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1j76wvw/have_a_huge_change_of_lifestyle_that_is_making_me/
loneliness,I Need Help.,"Hi y'all. I'm currently in a bit of a crisis and am coming to Reddit for advice. This post is probably going to be pretty long  so thank you in advance if you decide to read it. Regardless  I'll include a TL;DR at the end. I'm also going to crosspost to multiple subs for max visibility  and because I'm not sure which sub is the most fitting for the kind of help I'm seeking.

I don't know where to start  so I'll just jump right in. I'm alone and I'm lost. I'm 27m  and I live alone with my cat in Texas. I don't have a single friend that I would consider to be a “true"" friend. I have a couple of work acquaintances and a friend who lives in Florida who l've never met  but who I talk to every day. He's extremely emotionally detached but It's nice to be able to vent to him.

My problem is that l'm a serial loner. l've gone through life with friends and relationships coming and going  either due to them leaving or my own sabotaging. In middle school I was extremely socially awkward and was bullied relentlessly. In high school I started to find myself and became very social and found my group  but those friendships withered away soon after graduation. In college my social butterfly habits continued until I became serious with a girl who l'll call Ex 1. I dated her for 2.5 years and slowly stopped talking to all of my other friends because I was so focused on her. She was my best friend  and to this day is the ""bestest"" friend I've ever had. However  our relationship was super toxic (partially due to my mental health issues and also due to me being constantly unsure if she was ""the one"") and eventually we broke up in 2019  when I was 21. After we broke up I fell into an extremely dark depression that l've never really recovered from. I've made some friends since then (a group of neighbors that moved into the apartment next to mine  a motorcycle club that I formed  etc) but those friendships were always shallow and ended up dissolving for one reason or another. In 2020 I shot myself in the torso (not a suicide attempt  I was just incredibly depressed and delusional). In 2021 | got into a motorcycle accident that almost killed me and left severe  ugly scars all over my head. From October 2021 until September 2023 | worked as a mentor for young adults with severe mental health issues (ironic  I know). I quit that job (a very unethical and shady company) shortly before it went out of business  and now I work as an Amazon driver.

Which brings me to my current state of affairs. Since 2021  most people l've met have been through Yik Yak  a message board type app marketed towards college students. I met a girl there in February  who I'll call Ex 2. Over the next few months we became super close  and soon I was putting all of my time and value into her. I was beginning to think she was my future wife. That relationship is a story in itself  but in short  in July she moved back in with her parents  6 hours away from me. She downloaded Tinder and met a girl who quickly became my replacement. Things got ugly and we broke up about a month ago. Last week she told me she never really loved me and never wants to talk to me again  and I'm absolutely fucking devastated.

So now here I am. Another failed relationship and back to being completely alone. I'm in so much pain about this breakup  why she left me  wondering if our love was real  etc. but it's also making me realize that I myself am entirely too broken. I've always had severe OCD and EXTREME social anxiety. I've been depressed since 2019. Those are issues which I just began to address (I saw a psychiatrist for the first time on Thursday  who prescribed me Prozac  and I just enrolled myself in my job's health insurance plan  which I plan on using to have neuropsychological testing done and find a therapist)  but I'm scared that won't be enough.

The reason I'm coming here for help is that I'm trying to find insight on the issues of loneliness  relationships  friendship and love. I'm just confused about it all. Specifically  I'm struggling with the idea of needing to love myself and fix my own issues before being able to make lasting connections with people. I know logically that that's what I need to do  but I feel too alone to begin the process. What's the point in finding love and happiness within myself if I can't find it within anybody else? I'm just stuck and I don't know what to do. Sometimes I have moments of energy and hope  where I tell myself that I just need to heal myself and then I'll find love  but then when it comes time to actually start that process  I feel paralyzed. I remember how Ex 2 moved away and threw our whole relationship away and fell in love with someone else (they're planning on having a baby via a fertility clinic) like it was nothing. I remember that I'm alone. I don't want to do this alone. I will say that both of my parents are in my life and they are a blessing; the only people I have. But they don't struggle with the issues I have and they don't understand. I just want to be the confident social butterfly that I was in 7-8 years ago  but I don't know how. And I'm so scared that getting too old. Everybody my age is getting married and has the friends that they'll likely keep for the rest of their lives. How do I overcome this? Most importantly  what is the true meaning of companionship and how should I go about finding it?

Thanks again to those that decided to read that heap of word salad. Any advice or insight would be much appreciated.

TL;DR: I don't know how to make lasting connections with people. I don't know how to find friends that I value  or find healthy love. I need to reframe my mind but I don't know where to start.",4,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1g98giy/i_need_help/

loneliness,I'm really lonely and I need a help,"I always try to talk to people  but I either get rejected or ignored  or they just feel uncomfortable nearby me.

loneliness,3 am mental breakdown,It’s been a month since I’ve been in a very negative emotional state. I’m 15 and school feels so lonely. I always sit alone  and I’m constantly alone. The thing is I don’t think anyone in my family could even guess that this is how I spend all of my school days. I feel like I can’t be myself anywhere  that I don’t belong anywhere either. I always act happy when I’m around my family because I can’t bring myself to be vulnerable around them. But nobody gives a fuck about me or cares about how I’m doing. I lost a few friends since last year and grew apart some of them too. But it’s not the only reason of why I feel lonely. I feel lonely in my head  I feel lonely when I’m surrounded by people  I feel lonely when I’m having a good time. I can’t talk about how I feel to anyone I know because I know that they wouldn’t care or listen  or would just minimize my feelings or make fun of me. I don’t feel like I have anyone in my entourage who I feel comfortable with and close to . I do have friends who I talk to from time to time  but I don’t feel a real bond or connection to any of them. I lost a few friends like I said earlier  but even them didn’t care about me either  or were straight up toxic people. So I’ve been feeling very sad  and the fact that I don’t have anybody to talk about it or cheer me up makes me even sadder. I didn’t have school this week  classes where canceled. I spent all my days staying at home  with almost no notifications on my phone  no one to talk to even irl  with no motivation to do anything but lay down. During times like these  I start to hate my body and myself  and I disgust myself. I eat more because of sadness and stress  then cry because I feel so fat  but still can’t stop myself from eating so much. People don’t believe me when I say I hate myself and say they’d do anything to look like me  but they wouldn’t be able to comprehend the pure hatred I have for this body. I also feel guilty for not doing anything all day  but still procrastinate and feel stressed while doing so. Every night  I can’t sleep at all and start to think about every thing that’s wrong in my life  then i fall asleep and have nightmares almost every time. I can’t stop comparing myself to everyone I know  and think about how dumb  ugly  fat and useless I feel. I feel so lost and behind in life compared to people my age or people I know. But I don’t have the motivation to do anything about it or even think positively  so I just pity myself. I think what makes me feel the worst is I can’t bring myself to accept the way I’m feeling. I stay on my phone all day to avoid my brain from having these negative thoughts  then nighttime comes and everything comes out at once. I can’t talk about it to my brother and my parents cause I’m just not used to it and it brings me a huge feeling of discomfort  but keeping everything to myself is so painful too. These feelings are so heavy that I couldn’t even bring myself to talk about them to my therapist  it just wouldn’t come out and I don’t know why  so I just lied during my session. I don’t know how to get out of this negative place I’m in mentally,2,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1jgz9ro/3_am_mental_breakdown/
loneliness,Why do I feel the need to be lonely & cry about it?,"I don't know how to put this  but I've been wondering if I'm the only one experiencing this and why this happens. 

To put simply  I sometimes feel like I want/need to be lonely. I recognize this itself is wrong  since I also want and need the company of others. I yearn to belong and be wanted  but once the feeling of loneliness hits  I start to provoke it more. E.g. I start daydreaming of scenarios that make me cry etc etc. I also find myself imagining my future without a family and friends  sort of wishing I had none so I could really say I'm lonely  if that makes sense. Of course I don't want my family or friends to be gone  dear god no  but I get that feeling from time to time. And while I start feeling like this I also want to cry? It's not a rare occasion for me to cry in bed before I fall asleep. Why is this?

Of course  the reason why I feel lonely is because I lack a proper community IRL. I do live with my family and we spend every night at least an hour of just playing UNO & eating together  but they don't fulfill this need. They're not the people I'd go first talking about my problems. This doesn't explain the previously mentioned questions  however  or then I don't realize how this lack of a community explains them.



TL;DR: I sometimes feel like I'd want my family & friends be gone so I could really be lonely. While at it I also knowingly make myself cry. Don't know why.",3,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1j9tfkk/why_do_i_feel_the_need_to_be_lonely_cry_about_it/

loneliness,I’ve lost my spark and I feel like I’m spiralling,"
Ever since I lost my auntie  I’ve been spiralling. On the outside  I look like I’m coping pretty well  but internally  I’m screaming. I know they say it gets worse before it gets better  but I feel like everything is falling apart.

I’m 24 years old and I feel like I’ve got nothing left to live for. I have no job  no friends  no relationship  nobody in my life who has a positive impact upon it. Everything is such a mess  and I don’t know how I’m supposed to get myself out of this  or if I even want to. 

My auntie was the only person in my life who cared about me. She was my one source of support and stability in the world. I miss having someone to talk to  someone to have a laugh with  someone who was always there if I needed a hug. It felt like we were a team as we’d always help each other in any way we could. Now  I feel all alone in the world and I’ve never felt so isolated. I don’t know if I can keep going without her. Everything seems like a chore and I don’t find joy in anything. When I’m in a more rational state of mind  I know what I’m about to say is stupid  but it’s definitely a recurring thought. I honestly wish I would’ve gone when she did. I know I’m young and have my life ahead of me  but I’ve got nothing and no one left. There’s not been one day since she died that I’ve actually been glad I woke up.

I’m currently sat at the beach on a really nice sunny afternoon. Everyone around me is enjoying their time outside with someone else. I’m sat alone on a bench looking on from the sidelines. 

I don’t have anyone in my life anymore and it’s so lonely. I’ve always felt alone to a degree  but never on this scale. Now with grief added on top  I feel like I’m not really a part of society anymore. I’m existing  not living. I’ve tried to find people who could maybe relate to me  but it’s come to nothing. I don’t get my hopes up anymore when I see someone that seems to be in a similar situation to me. Everyone either ignores me or just says ‘I’m sorry’ or ‘good luck’ and moves on. I can appreciate from my post that I don’t sound like a very fun person to be around  but I am much more cheerful when I’m talking to people. I just feel like I have to make posts like this to find people who might feel the same and understand. I have no patience anymore for surface level interactions  but talking about deep things freaks a lot of people out. I know you have to build up a level of trust to have those conversations  and I’d happily take the time and effort to get to know someone. It’s just finding someone that I connect with in the first place. I have so much love and kindness to give  but I’ve never had anyone even give me a chance. I just want to matter to someone. That hope of eventually finding someone is the only thing keeping me alive right now.

I don’t really have anything to talk about with people I’m surrounded by irl. Nobody wants to talk about heavier topics like grief  which I can understand  but it’s hard when you feel you have no one to turn to. It’s pretty much consuming my life at the moment  so it would be nice to have somebody if I needed them. Apart from the grief  I have nothing going on in my life right now  except for feeling miserable. That means I’m either forgotten in a group conversation or I have people projecting all their personal life on me. I find that when people are telling me about their lives  I’m just nodding and not taking in anything they’re saying. I never would’ve been like that before  and I never used to zone out of conversations completely. I’ve not genuinely laughed or smiled since my auntie died- it’s all fake smiles and pleasantries from me. I’m glad other people are happy and have things going on in their lives  but everything seems so superficial and pointless to me. I’m my own worst enemy  because I’m so lonely  yet when I’m in other people’s company  I’m just waiting until I can leave. No one who I converse with is anything like me. It’s the classic lonely in a room full of people feeling.

The thing that scares me is that I don’t seem to care anymore. Sure  I’ve had days in the past where I’ve been in a bad mood and not wanted to do anything  but this is another level. For example  in the past I would’ve been really stressed about having no job and therefore no income  but now  even though I know my savings will run out eventually  I’m not making an effort to do anything about it. I know how I can solve some issues in my life  and I’m not proud of my attitude towards certain things  but I can’t push myself to do anything. I’m the most depressed I’ve ever been. Deep down  I know I want to get better  but I don’t see the point in trying to make a life for myself if I’m always going to feel so out of place and isolated. 

Nothing I seem to do makes me feel any better  and if it does  it’s a temporary fix. I can be having a half decent day  but the minute I’m left alone with my thoughts  I feel awful and often break down crying. This might sound strange  but one of the things that made me realise how bad things have got is me losing my love for music. I’ve loved music for as long as I can remember and it was what I always gravitated towards if I was struggling. I’ve gone from listening to songs everyday for hours  to having several days where I don’t listen to a thing. It also used to be a great distraction  but anytime I listen music now  my thoughts overpower it and I can’t focus on any part of the song. I was on the train a few days ago  and I used to love listening to music whilst watching the world go by  but I can’t even enjoy that anymore. I nearly ended up crying on the train  and it’s not the first time that’s happened. I think because I know it isn’t going to solve anything in the long run  I can’t seem to justify spending time listening to it. My thought processes have really been messed up.

I’m trying my best to look after myself and push forward  because I know that what’s my auntie would’ve wanted. I know eventually I’ll be grateful to my past self for pushing through this. I try my best to go out and have some new experiences  but most of the time  I don’t end up feeling any better. I find myself getting stressed out by other people’s actions  and if anywhere is crowded  I just want to run away. I’m happy doing some things alone  but when it’s all the time  nothing seems fun. I just find it hard when there seems to be no purpose for anything anymore. Every night I lie in bed and question whether this is all that life has to offer me. If so  I’d quite happily fall asleep and never wake back up. 

I needed to get all this misery out somewhere as I have no one to discuss it with. I do usually feel better for a while when I post something like this  but all the heaviness will come back eventually. I feel like it’s never going to leave me and I’ll always have this dull ache in my chest. 

I’m honestly scared where this is all going to end. I’m fighting the urge to hide away and shut myself in completely. I know I’m probably not the best person to be around at the moment  but I need someone. I’m not saying this to big myself up  but I’ve always been the one to help others  put their feelings and needs before mine. I’m sick of hearing so many people online saying you need to work on yourself before getting involved with others  romantically or platonically. There’s times in life when we’re all at our worst and need a bit of help and support from somebody. I’m not greedy  I just need one person who I click with  who gets me. I just wish someone would come and save me for once.",6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1ji1poz/ive_lost_my_spark_and_i_feel_like_im_spiralling/
loneliness,I feel like giving up ,"I've probably gone through CEN which has completely messed up my life. I'm 16 and from the age of 14 I've been experiencing intense loneliness  on and off depression  porn addiction. I've lost interest in everything  in every hobby of mine  studies and everything. I'm in 12th grade now and I'm not even studying! People say 12th grade is important for your career and college but I just don't the energy to study. I don't even have the energy to get out of my bed  to brush my teeth. 

I crave for love  someone to see me  understand me and appreciate me soooo much. I can't even explain. Sometimes I just spend nights crying just because of this and sleep around 4-5 am  waking up with swollen eyes. I have no friends I can turn to  my relationship with my parents is not good. They don't understand anything that I do  they don't appreciate me for the good things. They always keep talking about themselves  their likes  dislikes and just themselves. They don't even know who I am as a person. They don't know who their son is  his personality and all. 

My low self-esteem and perfectionism makes things even more harder. I don't find joy in my hobbies and interests anymore like playing guitar. Just holding guitar in my hands makes me tear up. Makes me feel heavy in my chest. My social skills are not good at all. I'm like an outcast in my high school with no friends. No one understands me  no one sees me. Why? Because I don't keep scrolling fucking instagram and play games all day like them. My personality is completely different from everyone maybe because of how I was raised. Just being alone in my head. Socializing is so hard for me  the fear of rejection and all  even my friends poke me that I'm an asshole I can't even be confident in front of them and all. I just can't explain how hard it is  spending all these years alone locked inside your home and then you imagine that when you'll get into teenage  everything will be alright but then you realise that everyone is so different from you and you don't have the skills  you've developed so many fears over all these years that it feels impossible. Loneliness is my main problem because it stems from my childhood and it feeds all the other. 

I've tried my best to control myself. Meditated for hours  journaled  tried a bunch of things out but nothing helps. Wish there was magic in this world so I could've felt better instantly. I'm still here and I haven't taken my life because I still believe someone will help me get through this. I don't think this belief is gonna last long. I've tried my best.",3,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1hkjatw/i_feel_like_giving_up/
loneliness,Tired of Being Alone. ,I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll be alone the rest of my life. I have family that I love and see regularly but I wish I could have someone to spend the rest of my life. It’s sad that I cry nestled to sleep almost every night cause I’m so lonely. I’ll watch people on social media with their partners and I’m like why are they so lucky. I don’t understand why anyone isn’t interested. Seems like guys are more into looks than anything else.  I’m not a beauty model but I’m not hideous either. Don’t know if I want to be on this planet anymore ,18,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1g6jokx/tired_of_being_alone/
loneliness,My auntie died last week and I’ve never felt more alone,"My auntie died last Wednesday and it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever had to deal with. She was 91 and I’m 24. I’m not naive- I knew with her age that at some point in the near future she wouldn’t be here anymore. It just all happened so fast and I can’t believe she’s really gone. 

Despite the difference in our ages  she was my best friend. I lived with her  and every single day we would have a laugh about something. We confided in each other about anything we needed to and knew we could trust each other. I could tell her anything  whether that was something silly that had happened at work or whether I needed advice on something more serious. 

I’ve always been a bit of a loner and I’ve found it hard to form connections with people. I struggle to articulate what I want to say sometimes  but that means I often come across in a way I don’t mean to. Because of this  I don’t have a big circle. I had come to accept the fact that I was always going to be lonely. I only began speaking to my auntie regularly about 3 years ago  due to her being a distant relative. We hit it off instantly  and she actually took the time to listen to me  which I’d never had in the past. Moving in with her is the best decision I ever made. Before this  I had learnt to be pretty self sufficient  even though I was living with my parents  and I always kept things to myself. I was pretty depressed and tried to escape my reality all the time through music  books  and video games. It felt like a new beginning with her where I was finally able to be myself. My auntie never shut me down or made passive aggressive comments. She always took the time to talk to me and try to understand where I was coming from. For someone who had never had that before  it had a massive impact. 

Now I feel like I’m back to three years ago before I started talking to her. I am absolutely miserable. Nothing I do helps. I wake up  after barely sleeping  and end up in tears before I’ve even left my bed. My appetite has gone  and when I try to eat  I just feel queasy. I’ve found myself crying and getting frustrated at any random thing. I’ve been working  as I don’t earn anything if I’m not there  and I thought it would help  but it isn’t. I work in retail  where I end up pacing the shop floor a lot  and that’s just fuelling my mind to keep thinking about the situation. Although I know I should keep busy at home  I don’t feel like doing anything  or if I try  I just end up in tears. 

Nobody really cares about me- only she truly did. Although I’m not particularly close with any of them  only one person out of about 15 people at work has said I’m sorry for your loss. I know they all know though  as they keep looking at me when they think I’m not looking. I appreciate it’s difficult to know what to say  but you could at least say I’m sorry. I know the world doesn’t revolve around me  but they’re all just carrying on talking to me about random trivial things as if nothing has happened to me. My immediate family aren’t the nicest of people. I get on well with my Dad  but the rest of them act like they care in order to get something from me  or try to control what I do. My auntie’s son and his wife have been really good with me  and they let me stay for a few days after she’d died. I didn’t want to overstay my welcome though  and they have each other. I only have one friend who I don’t see that often. In my eyes  my auntie was my family  and now she’s gone. I’d never experienced real family love off anyone before I met my auntie  and now that’s gone too. I feel like I was walking around alone in the world  she came into my life  and I had 3 years where I finally found my place  only for it to all be stripped away  and now I’m alone again. I’m scared I’m never going to find love again  in every sense of the word. I know with my auntie it was because there was such a big age difference  but I’m also scared that if I do find love  I’m going to go through this cycle in life of me loving someone  only for them to be taken away from me. 

The past couple of nights I’ve been back home. It’s been really hard. I try to make it as positive as possible and keep myself occupied. The first night I got myself a pizza and put a film on  but I only ate about two slices before my appetite went  and I couldn’t concentrate on the film. I then just cried for several hours until I finally fell asleep. I knew I had to come back eventually  but I’m dreading coming in from work every night now. The house is so silent and I’m surrounded by all these memories. The hardest part is when I first come in from work  as she always used to greet me and ask about my day. I hate coming home to an empty house. 

I honestly don’t know what to do. I know the feeling will pass  but at the minute  I really don’t want to be here anymore. My life outside of living with my auntie was not really the life I wanted for myself  and it often got me down. Being able to live with her and have her to cheer me up spurred me on to try and change things. Now the one good thing is gone  I don’t even want to try  because everything just seems crap. I’ve got no one and nothing now. I’m already finding it hard having no one to talk to  but having to put on a brave face every day for work is making it harder. There’s nothing good to get up for in the morning. I know before she was ill  she always told me she wanted me to be happy. That is the only thing at the moment that has stopped me from doing something stupid  as I know she would’ve been horrified if I did. I do want to be happy  it just seems unobtainable for so many different reasons.

I’m certainly starting to understand the phrase ‘it’s better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all’. I’m so so grateful for every moment I had with her and I know now what real love is. I just want her back. 

I’m not looking for sympathy from people with this post  I just needed to get this out of my head. Thanks for taking the time to read this if you got this far.",5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1gubt45/my_auntie_died_last_week_and_ive_never_felt_more/
loneliness,I am in bits and having mental breakdown. ,"How do I stop crying every day and feel so depressed and lonely??! 
I am born in Eastern part of Europe. 
My blood family abounded me when I was just 10y old  I worked in child labour and had denied education. 
Coming from big family  yet being in child labour and homeless made a hole in my heart  I can't even describe the pain!
It didn't toke a lot work for a boy to get my attention as I just wanted someone to love me  - yet he said clearly that I am too young to be a mum (17) and forced me to have an abortion (after living together for one year). 
He given me money for abortion  yet I used that money to get passport and move abroad! 
I was single mum with my daughter when I met this man who promised to be there for me and raised my daughter as his own. I thought I love him. 
We started relationships  I got pregnant with my second child only to find out that he is already married  I am his second wife and he only needed me for visa. 
Anyways  due to my low self esteem and lack of confidence and fear of becoming homeless again  single mum with two kids  I accepted the fact and accepted her!!!
Even met with her many times and my kids knows her kids. 
They all are Pakistanis!
And despite I have accepted the fact  - he never introduced me to his blood family. He is from big family  - eight siblings and in 16/17 years not even ONCE he called and said ""hi  meet my wife!"" No happy birthdays  happy new year  nothing! Not even congratulations with new born! (he is 12y old now). 
His first wife speaks a lot about Pakistan  she goes there a lot  she just spent one month there. 
Yet I am NOT ALLOWED to go!! 
We have small family business where I work but I don't get paid to get my financial freedom!
He says I should be happy that food on the table and roof over the head. But I feel I am still in the child LABOUR where I was born into. I know in Islam you can have four wives but they must be treated equally. 
She has paid job  her eldest child has good job  she even bought a small cottage in our neighbourhood and gets rent from there and he is supporting them  - yet I work for free! Just for food and bills. 
For the last EIGHT (!) years we even sleep in seperated rooms - he says he gets disturbed by noise and can only sleep alone (which I call BS)! He gets laid at her house instead. 
So I am not his wife I am literally his free employee. 
Almost every night I am begging to him to sit in one room with me and kids so we talk  about anything. And me begging like :""please don't go just sit 10min more  please just sit with us 15min more!""
We have nothing to talk about  - we haven't got joined memories  - since we met I am just for work and she is for enjoyment. She speaks his language  she knows the family. I haven't even got a friend whom to trust. The most I would go is to speak to my daughter  she says I should just date someone. 
I feel so lonely every day!! Nobody to talk  snuggle  nobody to whom to cry! 
He sometimes books holidays for me with kids abroad  - he will book me ticket to moon if I wanted  but never to Pakistan as if I am his dirty secret. 
I mean if I met his wife then what else is he hiding?! This year in May I told him :""your family are dead to me same as my own family  because you treat me like secret!"" 
He said me back :""it's all in your head  get a therapy!"" 
If it's in my head only  then why in 16y nobody ever spoke to me?
Last time I told him :""I am booking tickets to Pakistan I need holidays! "" taken his bank card and he replied :""I will book tonight for you  I promise!"" 
Next day he gives me and kids tickets to Morroco! 
I said ""you promised!""
He back :""you are so ungrateful! You wanted holidays and you got a holidays!!""
I don't want to meet his family anymore  because he isn't my husband anymore!! 
I feel like if I don't know them maybe it will be easier for me to move on with my life. 
I met him when my daughter was 2y old and she will be 18y old next year. 
Which I should be grateful to him  as he raised her and she calls him dad  but despite that he never introduced her with his family either. 
They all call and speak only to my youngest child. 
Some time ago I thought about packing bags and go  but if I would struggle to pay my rent and bills I would not get any support as mortgage is also in my name (joined mortgage). That's literally the only good thing I am getting out of 16y free labour  and I fear if I will move out then she will move in and literally I would just hand my house over!! So I decided I will stay here and go and work somewhere in the city (we live in village) and find new friends and maybe someone who will stop making to feel this lonely. 
I booked holiday flight Manchester - Istanbul Turkey - Lahore Pakistan for January  And lied to my family I am going to Turkey for two weeks holidays. He will only find out I am in Pakistan when I change the flights in Turkey! . And as I said I won't even visit his family  I will stay two weeks in Lahore and Maybe islamabad  and when I came back I will start job somewhere else! 
He won't be dropping me in airport if he will know I am going to Lahore  but he won't be suspicious when he takes me to Turkish Airlines!
We don't argue a lot  we just don't talk anymore much. 
Feeling sad. 
Our business is closing down at 8pm  he usually opens early and goes home earlier. And I need to shut it when I shut I go home to my own room and then he wakes up next day and opens it and we are like strangers. I don't wear glasses but I cry every night so my eyes are swollen and just frames from glasses covers my swollen eyes so nobody asks me questions. I have like a lump in my throat I can't swollow. I haven't got any friends to trust  any family  no parents  no siblings  just my two kids and I don't want them to know that I cry every night recently even at work I just want to hide in bathroom and cry...

So he tells to his first wife almost that she don't need to be jealous on me that I don't worth it.

loneliness,So completely alone (rant),"29M.  Autistic.  No real friends  no wife/gf  no actual skills or any real adult interests/hobbies.  ASD.  I do everything alone  and everything I like I always only ever enjoy it alone.  Even when I try new things  other people always seem to rather do things with each other.  Happened all through childhood.  Happened in college.  Happened in trade school.  People are always getting together  doing things with each other  developing friendships and relationships.  Never with me.  I'm always by myself.  I can't take this anymore.  But I've all but given up.  I barely post online anywhere or really talk to anyone anymore.  I don't even leave my house because I can't stand being reminded how everyone else is together and I'm always alone.  I feel like picking up new hobbies or 'doing what I love' yadda yadda doesn't mean anything because it'll always only ever be me doing it  all by myself.  It's especially painful when it's something that I know other people like and I have no encounter other people sharing the thing I like together and I'll only ever have myself to enjoy it with.  I've tried therapy but the therapists only ever tell me generic things like ""love yourself"" (what is there about me to love?  Clearly  nobody else thinks I'm good enough to include me in anything  what have I to be proud of or love myself for?)  the bland stuff about finding doing things I love (again  I'm never going to enjoy doing everything alone for the rest of my life)  and generally just telling me I should ""feel better"" without saying or doing anything to address the fact that I'M LONELY AS HELL AND I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

Seriously  I'm freaking out about how I'm going to live like this every day  spending every day talking to no one  connecting with no one  having no one to spend anytime with  no one who thinks I'm worthy or deserving of love.  And then having everyone tell me I'm 'selfish' and 'self-entitled' and all that toxic internet stuff all because I'm a human being who wants connection but for some reason nobody is ever going to want me.  Then having to go out in public and witness other people spending time together with their friends  their wives and girlfriends  their kids and their families  and have all this stuff that I'll never have shoved in my face.  Then be told dismissive things like  ""Oh  just because you're alone doesn't mean you're lonely""  or ""It'll happen when you least expect it""  or ""The world doesn't owe you love/sex"" (and why do ya'll ALWAYS bring up sex?  Like it's 1) the only thing I want  like because I'm a guy it's impossible for me to want connection  romance  a partner  someone to share with... 2) that it's such a horrible thing for me to want that)

  
I've tried everything.  I've ""put myself out there"".  No one talks to me.  All I get is blank stares  one word answers  dismissive answers  people huddling together turning their backs on me so they all interact with each other and not me  neurotypicals giving each other that stare that silently says ""wow  what a weirdo""  being judged for being being  getting called creepy and a misogynist for daring to be a heterosexual male and even try to speak to a woman  getting fired from every job for the most menial  stupid reasons  getting left out of every activity  every get together  every project  everything.  I'm just so sick of being in pain every day.  I'm sick being ignored  and laughed at  and getting turned into the villain just because I'm lonely and everybody else is blessed with birth-given social skills that I don't have.  So that means it's all my fault and I'm a horrible person.  I've tried to be nice.  Be friends with people.  Find common interests.  All that stuff.  I've followed every piece of advice to a T.  Therapy  groups  meds  school  work  etc.  Nothing works.  No one wants to be around me.  No one wants to be my friend.  No one wants to spend time with me.  Or get close to me.  Or touch me.  Or know me.  Or share their life or include me or have anything to do with me.  I want to end it all but I can't because I've got a cat.  Oh god  I can't do this.  It'll be at least 10 more years until he dies of old age.  I can't do this.  10 more years of loneliness.  Of being in complete solitude.  Pacing around my empty home every day screaming at myself about how much I hate myself.  Not sleeping at night  crying and wishing I had someone who loved me to hold me.  (I bet you're all laughing at me as I wrote that.)  I can't take this.  The whole world is so cruel  other people are nothing but cruel  cold  and dismissive to me.  I never did anything wrong.  I don't understand why people hate me so much.  Is it so wrong of me to just wants friends  and a woman who loves me  and a good career  and a normal life that all the neurotypical people get to have?  Am I really so selfish and self-entitled for just wanting to be part of the world and be included?",6,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1fwv1c5/so_completely_alone_rant/
loneliness,I hate my life and want to end it,"Idk why I am typing this... just created this account because I am this desperate for help. 

Everything in my life is shit. I just don't know what to do anymore.. I feel like killing myself..
I can't even stick to my workout schedule because I am this suicidal.. I hate eating. It's the same shit everyday and also exhausting. The fact that I am human also disgusts me in a way. I am just ashamed of myself.. I have noone. My dad died last year.. my birthgiver on the other hand who I live with is an abuse piece of ... (not gonna call names although I would want to say so much bad shit about this person.. ugh feel like vomiting)... literally traumatized by her. I believe that she is a narcissist. 

Anyways.. regardless of that I can't find to seem joy in life anymore. Everything is draining me. Feel like a piece of fat shit and am afraid of loosing my muscles that I have built. I have already not been active at all for about 2 weeks I believe and I just hate this feeling of loosing my strenght  rusting and becoming weaker and weaker.. 

I did watch lots of movies the past week being in another depressive episode again  which I am still in..  and watching some funny videos here and there laughing but I am still being tormented in my insides by everything that has happened to me and the pain I am feeling..
I genuinely don't know if I can keep existing anymore. I have no energy to make new friendships.. I am scared of people.. scared of abuse or being threatened and treated like garbage.

The fact that I also crave love and compassion AND on top of all of that am a fuckin human being is so disgusting to me. I just want to vanish and have never existed in the first place. My birthgiver should have just gotten an abortion and that would've been best for me and probably for her too. I hate the fact that I am saying this but man I am hurt.

Noone wants me or needs me. Makes no difference if I am not here anymore. I do have my uncle (my dads brother) and a good friend of mine but man I ultimately don't give a shit if they suffer if I really decide to kill myself.. this is my life and I can do whatever the fuck I want. Why am I even here?! I just want this knife sticking through my chest to be gone. I can't live with it like this anymore. 

On top of that I can't seem to find a job.. been only getting rejections and my money is running out..
Luckily from tomorrow on I'll partially be in a psych ward... hope this will help but I still feel so lost. I don't know if it'll make a difference. After my 1 to 2 month stay there I will have to have a job and man I just don't think I can do it. If I just were financially secure and had a loving home (instead of a sick toxic place) things would be so much better for me.. 

I hate being an adult.. I just feel like a lost small boy.. no matter how old my body is my spirit will always be a small young boy running wild in his dreams..

Idk Idk Idk...

Idk man.. I am really lost here. Whatever.. 
I am just lost.. forever..

Edit: So it seems that it'll take a little longer until I can go to the psych ward. Hopefully no later than a week but it's also not promised so yeah.. this is not good. Gotta have to deal with this fucked up pain till then..",12,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1g4v5rt/i_hate_my_life_and_want_to_end_it/
loneliness,I feel like I did something wrong  I just grew to hate my life,I don’t really have someone there that I can totally be myself with. or even just be ask them to go and do something together like go out to eat. there was someone I was speaking to for a few months I met from work and we went on a lot of dates but it was so off putting because after such a long time nothing physical happened and then she calls me the perfect man after we had a great conversation over text and then after 1 more date she just stopped messaging and so did I because I knew it wasn’t gonna work after that  but I just feel so empty seeing all these people with their friend groups  in relationships or even people that speak to people and the other person are interested and even willing to hang out with them. I just feel like I did something wrong that cursed me to never have someone by my side that I can just speak to whenever I need them. There has to be something I can do. A lot of people say just to work on myself  but I still feel extremely alone. Excluding family I go days without speaking to someone that I want to speak to. What hurts more is the fact that I can’t even get into a simple relationship or speak to someone at this stage. And tbh I am still hurt that this person didn’t speak to me anymore even though I felt like she wasn’t really interested but now I’m getting older I just want to enjoy life you know. My family and friends that I speak to occasionally have a lot to do and i’m just here like I did something wrong. I get along with people at work and they say they like me but it’s so disheartening knowing that I didn’t really feel loved or loved someone and they loved me back. I can’t believe i’m typing this but I just wanted to hear from someone. I keep telling myself I can be better but It don’t seem like it  I honestly wish I had someone their that shared the same hobbies as me and enjoyed my company. This person I spoke to for a couple months did but I guess she never really liked me enough to take it the next stage  I can’t force it but I wish it worked out. My mental health is at its lowest it’s ever been. I actually hit a solid wall that I never wanted to acknowledge was their but There’s no hiding from it now. If there’s anyone that felt like this and managed to catch a hobby or maybe found a way out that can help me. ,4,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1gy8ezi/i_feel_like_i_did_something_wrong_i_just_grew_to/

loneliness,Am 31 years old and hated by women in every aspect of my life. What can I do and if there is nothing that can be done  What wrong with feeling so bad about this?,"I've tried everything in the book about meeting women but nothing works. To give you guys an idea of what I look like physically  Am 6:1 138 pounds 31 years old and black. Am a software engineer and I live in a 3bedroom house by myself. Ever since I was a teenager  Girls disliked and hated me for no apparent reason and I saw even the so called loosers with at least 1 girl. Every guy had a prom date except for me and when i showed up  The female principal told me that there was no point in me coming because girls will never see me as prom type EVER! I had to go back home and I felt so hated and disliked that I did not understand why am so condemned by women. My prom fee was refunded back to me and I was not allowed to take a picture for the year book and the principal had no reason for me. As I approached adulthood and went to college  It got even worse. I don't want to talk about my 9 years of college life because it was the most traumatic and heart breaking years of my life. I've tried every advice yahoo answers have given me but the same thing from high school and college keeps repeating it's self and am out of options. I've even went to a therapist to see if something was wrong with me but they said there is nothing wrong with me to be diagnosed. When I commute to work  I see men and women talking to each other and I see many couples  young and old and it makes me feel so bad about myself. I've never experienced my first kiss  Am still a virgin and never even experienced a hug from a woman. I don't have female friends and never had female friends in my life. It's hard to function knowing the fact that this is my situation and paying a hooker does not solve it because I know it's because AM PAYING! I want to get married and have kids but I can't even picture it because of the overwhelming hate I get from women. I don't smell in any way and my hygiene is good and I've tried to approach women but nothing worked. I even hired a dating coach and when he asked the women why they disliked me  They said ""He's too ugly."" or ""I just don't like him. My coach thinks am handsome but why does it matter when women say otherwise. I've never even experienced 1 valentine in my life while I see the vast majority of the world celebrate it like it's meant for everyone. I've been living in my house alone with my dog ""Jack"" for so many years and all I can do is imagine what my home will look like if I had a family of my own. Am 31 years old and am very much convinced my entire life would be lonely and I will die alone. Am I wrong to envy and hate people that have families and a spouse? Am I wrong to hate women in general? Am I wrong to hate children? Am I wrong to persecute everything I mentioned in my heart? Am I wrong to feel this way because I can never have any of these things I mentioned? If so  How am I suppose to feel abut this as I keep living the years of my life? How can I possibly live a functional life in loneliness? How can I ever be happy in loneliness? ",7,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/59erzw/am_31_years_old_and_hated_by_women_in_every/
loneliness,Should I (21m) join incel communities?,"

I (21m) have a rough post history that should indicate excruciating life struggles pertaining to isolation and a lack of dating options. I've done everything in my power  for years upon years  to try and ""put myself out there""  but it's always felt like I'm in square one no matter how far or how hard I try to dig myself out of this proverbial hole.

All said and done  I want to join an incel community. I feel like it's the only place where I wouldn't stick out like a sore thumb  where I can find solace in the company of those doomed to fail at life as I eventually will (or have already). At this point I've accepted that I'll never have romantic or sexual relationships again; I'm just so ugly and everything I do is a turn off to most ""normal"" people  for lack of a better word.

I've recently come to a realization that I'm probably autistic/neurodivergent  though I'm comfortable enough to call myself r*tarded since nothing could be closer to the truth. It's been a very hard pill to stomach as I'm probably the LAST person who should be cursed with any kind of social disability.  I crave human intimacy  I'd give an arm and a leg to form effortless connections with others  especially with the opposite gender; but I'm endowed with something that makes it infinitely harder to obtain  at which point giving up is the most reasonable course of action.

I want everyone's unbiased opinions on the incel communities because I'm wary and wilfully avoidant of the consequential negativity that pervades them. In short  I need to know if any of them are non-toxic  non misogynistic etc.  spaces where I can just exist among other unfortunate souls? I'll never have the place of belonging I truly need  but if this is the next best thing  so be it.

I know practically nothing when it comes to being social. I've existed around others for years yet I've learned precious little about social cues  appropriate decorum  or all that jazz surrounding interpersonal protocol. I'm starved of physical affection  devoid of emotional connections and severely detached from any positivity otherwise afforded the rest of society.

Just tell me where I should go  and if the incel communities are the haven I believe it to be. I'll never be loved to the extent I've aways desired  so I might as well hate myself surrounded by those that would do the same.

DISCLAIMER: I'll try to ignore replies that I disagree with because it almost always cascades into an argument when I respond in states of visceral emotional intensity (such as now  to state the obvious).

P.S. try not to ridicule the depths to which I strain in adequately expressing my thoughts and feelings through writing... I have the self awareness to realize that even the stilted manner in which I write serves as a testament to how r*tarded I am. Though there's nothing I know that would solve such debilitating hard-wiring.

TLDR I get no girls and there's hardly any changing that. Every day i feel pain that does not subside. Should I find solace among incels  for i am clearly one of them?",10,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1jif341/should_i_21m_join_incel_communities/
loneliness,3 am mental breakdown,It’s been a month since I’ve been in a very negative emotional state. I’m 15 and school feels so lonely. I always sit alone  and I’m constantly alone. The thing is I don’t think anyone in my family could even guess that this is how I spend all of my school days. I feel like I can’t be myself anywhere  that I don’t belong anywhere either. I always act happy when I’m around my family because I can’t bring myself to be vulnerable around them. But nobody gives a fuck about me or cares about how I’m doing. I lost a few friends since last year and grew apart some of them too. But it’s not the only reason of why I feel lonely. I feel lonely in my head  I feel lonely when I’m surrounded by people  I feel lonely when I’m having a good time. I can’t talk about how I feel to anyone I know because I know that they wouldn’t care or listen  or would just minimize my feelings or make fun of me. I don’t feel like I have anyone in my entourage who I feel comfortable with and close to . I do have friends who I talk to from time to time  but I don’t feel a real bond or connection to any of them. I lost a few friends like I said earlier  but even them didn’t care about me either  or were straight up toxic people. So I’ve been feeling very sad  and the fact that I don’t have anybody to talk about it or cheer me up makes me even sadder. I didn’t have school this week  classes where canceled. I spent all my days staying at home  with almost no notifications on my phone  no one to talk to even irl  with no motivation to do anything but lay down. During times like these  I start to hate my body and myself  and I disgust myself. I eat more because of sadness and stress  then cry because I feel so fat  but still can’t stop myself from eating so much. People don’t believe me when I say I hate myself and say they’d do anything to look like me  but they wouldn’t be able to comprehend the pure hatred I have for this body. I also feel guilty for not doing anything all day  but still procrastinate and feel stressed while doing so. Every night  I can’t sleep at all and start to think about every thing that’s wrong in my life  then i fall asleep and have nightmares almost every time. I can’t stop comparing myself to everyone I know  and think about how dumb  ugly  fat and useless I feel. I feel so lost and behind in life compared to people my age or people I know. But I don’t have the motivation to do anything about it or even think positively  so I just pity myself. I think what makes me feel the worst is I can’t bring myself to accept the way I’m feeling. I stay on my phone all day to avoid my brain from having these negative thoughts  then nighttime comes and everything comes out at once. I can’t talk about it to my brother and my parents cause I’m just not used to it and it brings me a huge feeling of discomfort  but keeping everything to myself is so painful too. These feelings are so heavy that I couldn’t even bring myself to talk about them to my therapist  it just wouldn’t come out and I don’t know why  so I just lied during my session. I don’t know how to get out of this negative place I’m in mentally,2,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1jgz9ro/3_am_mental_breakdown/

loneliness,19m. I don’t have anyone to relate to.,I’m not good at anything. And it is partly my fault and it partly isn’t. Number one I’m poor as fuck. My family is very very poor. Lower middle class. House looks like shit. But I’m not a tough guy  hood rat anything like that because I grew up in a preppy white neighborhood. Everyone has nice houses while mine looks like a trap house in the middle of the nice neighborhood. I never had nice toys growing up. Never had ps4 or Xbox. It doesn’t matter  I’m not superficial. As a kid I was draw and make cut outs and use newspaper to make my own toys. I’m decently intelligent  but I act like a tard. Why? I have anxiety an ocd diagnosed  but I also VERY VERY likely have adhd. Very likely as in I was in denial for the longest time  and my parents didn’t want to get me tested and I was supposed to get tested but I never did. People with adhd literally tell me I have adhd. I have almost every key mark symptom. Don’t even want to get tested atp bc for some reason every other loser who has it gate keeps it. It’s severe if i do have it. Well that sucks  my parents don’t believe in it  I’m already past Highschool so there’s little benefit in getting aid now  and I did decent in Highschool but struggling my ass off now and there’s little I can do about it. It keeps me up at night at times. Mind wont shut up. If it’s not that it’s my ocd or anxiety giving me a tuff time. If it’s not that THEN ITS MY DUST MITE ALLEGY AND ASTHMA  WHCIH LITERALLY MAKES IT HARD TO BREATHE  SLEEP  AND FOCUS ON TOP OF ALL THAT. Well at least I can eat what I want right? Wrong. I have gut issues. Like really bad. I suspect I have IBS but again never got diagnosed because my luck with things in general is just not great and one of those things is getting help I need. Maybe the world just doesn’t care for me. No matter how many other people I help it doesn’t seem to come back to me. People automatically are aggressive towards me. No matter how big or small. So I struggle to think  focus  eat  rest  properly perhaps I’m gifted in some other aspect? Athletics? I love sports. Too bad I suck at almost everything athletic. I’ve never been fast. Never. Have horrible stamina. Assume both of that is from asthma. My speed and stamina have improved REALLY dramatically since a child and I’m grateful. I guess at this point I’m slightly above average if anything but that’s because I’m a young male and the world is majority metabolically unhealthy. My genetics aren’t great for lifting or athletics. I have a very lanky frame  and I am skinny fat. I have great agility and jumping power though  I’m greatful for that but if I was healthy I would be even better. You’d think I was athletic looking at me but I hate being such a disappointment. My catching abilities are also subpar. And don’t get me started on throwing. One thing I was blessed with is looks. Sort of. I have decent facial features  and my face holds very little fat and is quite robust. But all this does is make me attention hungry and self obsessed because it’s one of the few good things in my life. Or was. I have auto immune condition that not only fqs up my skin but now is affecting my hair. My hair use to give me tips at the drive though. I was bullied as a kid for being ulgy so when I was getting praised all of a sudden it felt insanely good. Now it’s Thinner all over. Think it’s affecting my facial hair too. My skin use to be great now it’s uneven  blemished  has acne scars  ACTUAL scars  and I have had multitide of issues in the past like whiteheads  keratosis pilaris  eczema you name it. Right now I have clogged inner sweat glands on my thighs. Gross. My penis I think is probably below average. The acid reflex and probably increased acidity from difficulty breathing while I sleep makes my teeth naturally yellow. I had fqed teeth as a child and I got braces but they took so long an never finished the job so now I have a gap between one of my teeth and my canine so I look like a pirate. And although I said I have good looks  I’m slightly above average at best. I’m by no means some Sean o pry or anything like that. I’m also a dark skinned  curly haired Indian. And I have all these health issues so young  plus fqed teeth so now it doesn’t matter if a girl checks me  it’s almost basically clips. And because I’m south Asian  but dark skinned male with curly hair I’m hated on by literally every race. White  black my own  you name it. Can’t name a single group of people or country whre I feel like I’d belong and get appreciated by the people. Def not my ethnic country Bangladesh and prob not the USA. I was a class clown growing up so epople sort of like me for that but nobody takes my feeling seriously at the same time. And like I said  my ethnic origin and phenotype may not be ideal but I got to look good for like a few years and now (whole still in my youth) I barely get to experience that now. I have nothing redeemable at this point. My family hates me. They have yelled at me constantly my whole life. I’m horrible ways. And I’m a freaking baby. I wish so much I was a brave  tough non anxious man. So much so. My mom and dad hate each other but never divorced because of culture. Verbal and physical violence towards me  and each other was so common growing up. I in general don’t succeed in things I’m passionate about. I was religious from 13-17 to cope with all my stress in life. Islamic. Now I’m starting to let go of thst too. I was never raised religious   I took it upon my self. My dad literally doesn’t even like it. He constantly ridicules me and hates me for being religious. How unlucky am i  I’m the only one with an ethnic dad who dislikes that his son is religious? The religion he basically chose FOR ME. All he does is talk about grades and talk down on me and my mom. Back to my looks I’m much taller than him. One of the few good things in my life is my height but I honestly don’t care mcuh for it. My sister hates me too. She has anger issues and my parents can barely handle her. Yet they bought her a car. And not me even though I was and still am in college and full time employed. I have this ridiculously annoying cousin who can’t mind her own busienss for her life who immigrated here and lives with us. 30 year old child. Well she as gone.. WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE  and now that I dropped out and am attending university near my house she back..my life bro. My job pays below minimum wage and biweekly yet I love it. It’s one of the few escape I have. I don’t play video games much bc of lack of access  proper education and because I’m not great at those either. All these people talking about money doesn’t buy happiness  or how they are falling apart because of a heartbreak and yet I can barely struggle to enjoy even the little pleasures in life and for what reason? What wrong have I done? I’m not even superficial never have been all I wanted was a chance and I never got it? I don’t even have the balls to take my own pathetic life. I hate natural selection for ignoring all my ancestors and somehow making a mess like me. I use to be scared of dying in my sleep  but if I could be guaranteed heaven in the afterlife I’d take it in a heartbeat. So tired of living my life. I’m sorry for this rant but I have to let all this out. There are a dozen or more other things I could have listed. But as I’m typing this it’s 7am and I got like four hours sleep last night and want to get some more today.

loneliness,I think something is wrong with me,"I really apologise for this really long post. If you do end up reading it thank you. Even that is enough. Sorry I sound like I'm complaining  I just don't really know where to go  I just really want someone to tell me what is wrong with me. 

I (28F) know it's common to think that there is something wrong when you're isolated. I've been told many times by my therapists  psychiatrists  past ""friends"" that there is nothing wrong with me. I get it. It's the easiest answer to give and who is actually analysing somebody that deeply? But I can't help shake this feeling. 

I always had problems making friends growing up. As a kid  a parent who  I guess  felt sorry for me ask her child to be friends with me. It worked  but we are not really friends (I'll get to why I feel like I'm not friends with any of these people in the end). High school I had no friends at all because I went to 7 high schools and couldn't be bothered to make friends knowing that I will change schools soon. In university I thought I made friends  but realising now that is not the case. And for the past 5 years I haven't spoken to anyone except saying ""hello  how are you"" at work.

Before I get into why I feel they are not my friends  here are the reasons why I think there is something wrong with me. Here are some reasons: 
- whenever I did hang around people and try to talk to them (I ask them about their background  I try to pick up on things that they like and talk it   gossip (though I hate gossiping)  talk about trends  news  sports  literally whatever they like) I see that once I stop asking questions or trying to carry the conversation they become silent and walk away. This was clear to me in parties in particular. 
- Another reason is  because I know people judge others base on appearances  which is fine  I tried my best to dress and look like others. I only did this when I notice people who dress and look similar hang out with each other. So I tried to follow and dress like them. This goes along with behaving like them. Despite this  people never like to talk to me.
- I remember in school and university  whenever we needed to choose partners for a project  I was always the last resort. 
- people keep forgetting I am there. One time a groups of friends drove off and left me in a small ski town because they forgot about me. I had to rent a car to drive back alone. It seems like I am invisible.
- It seems people never want to talk to me. A few times I had friends who had friends living abroad and they would make the effort to call them on the phone regularly. A lot of the times I was there when they made the call so I heard what they talked about... gossip  life updates  interest  travel. But it seems that when I talke about the same  they showed no interest. 

I know people drift away  I know that people have their own lives  I know people have their own problems  so I'm trying my best to be understanding and forgiving as possible. When I am around people I make an effort to smile  be energetic  talk about them and their interest  try to avoid talking about myself unless someone asks  I just try to be like others and how I observe them. But no matter what  it seems that people have some sort of aversion to me. The reason I don't think my past friends are my friends for the following:

- when my friends talk and catch up with their friends (as my last point above) they made the effort to call once a month or two. When I moved abroad I called those friends of mine  talked about similars things they like to talk about (and they enthusiastically talked about it with their other friends)  but once I stop initiating all connection was gone. I haven't heard from them since. 
- I don't care for my own birthday  I never did... But I always cared and celebrated my friends. I wished them a bday and then gifted something or planned something. I never expected anything in return  and they have said they have a hard time to remember peoples birthday  which is completely okay. However  I know that's a lie because I see them wishing  baking cakes  excitedly wishing their other friends birthdays (even though I've known them for longer... Not that that matters)
- whenever I expressed to someone that I have some mental issues  right away they distance themselves. Which again is okay because people have different capacities to cope with such things. However I see them being completely there for someone else. I even have one friend who works with people with mental health problem  but she turned her back on me  but not on others. 

Essentially I realise I have no friends because I see the capacity they have of being a good friend to others  but they don't reciprocate towards me. Despite me trying to be there for them. I know this sounds like a me versus them problem and I try not to view it that way  but as the years pass  it's hard not to get into that state of mind.

I thought initially it was just the group of friends I was hanging out with  but I tried making new friends with different people. I'm abroad for work and tried with different people. Nothing works. I don't know if I'm so incompetent in making friends. I don't know if I make others uncomfortable. I though maybe I was a narcissist  but doing all the test and asking my multiple therapists  they all say I'm definitely not. I just don't understand why nothing is working. 

This has been going on for sometime now  I see my behaviours and mental state is deteriorating. It's hard to smile  it's hard to have energy  it's hard to maintain conversations when people don't show interest  it's hard to be happy  even the idea of meeting new people exhaust me. I even try to do the opposite. Instead of caring and being the person that initiates  I tried toning it down  try to be ""cooler"" (I hate viewing things that way btw)  but all of that resulted in not one talking to me. 

I try not to be so dependent on people giving me happiness  but being socially isolated is like going against the hardware of being a social being. I'm tired of people telling me that you need to find interest or whatever generic advice (though I know it's coming from a good place  so I still appreciate it and I'm not angry)  I  have an interests and hobbies but being isolated still affects my mind. Not being able to connect with anyone around is causing me some concern. I'd rather live in the middle of a forest and be at peace there. I think it would be easier to come to terms with myself. 

Anyway  thank you for reading this far. I just needed to say this. If you have any clue what is wrong with me  or if you have similar experiences  please share  because I feel like my reality is slowly melting away.

loneliness,Warning from a lonely boy  Don't let high standards & 'classiness' isolate you.,"Hey everyone 

Posting this from my bed alone I'm currently doing an internship. From the outside  things probably look fine – student  intern  living independently. But honestly  I'm incredibly lonely most of the time. I miss my college days and friends constantly  but I hate phone calls  video calls feel forced... I crave real  physical presence  which is hard to come by.

And I've realised a lot of this loneliness is my own damn fault  stemming from how I tried to build myself.

I got really into studying human behaviour  trying always to be logical  ethical  moral  and ""classy."" I thought being the ""perfect kid"" who never did anything wrong or ""cringe"" was the way to be. I believed silence was strength  that women liked the ""classy  silent man "" all that stuff.

Here's the trap I fell into  and I'm warning anyone  especially if you're younger  NOT to do this:

1. Trying to be perfectly logical and classy meant suppressing huge parts of myself. My spontaneity  my vulnerabilities  the silly or ""cringe"" stuff that makes us human. I see people I used to call ""cringe"" living freely and seeming genuinely happier. Connection happens in shared imperfection  not curated perfection. All my rules just built walls.
2. I overthink everything. ""What will they think?"" ""Is this classy enough?"" ""Am I being logical?"" It's exhausting and stops me from just being in social situations or even posting simple things online (like playing cricket) because my self-esteem is shot. I feel like I don't deserve to share because I haven't met my own impossible standards.
3. The ""Classy/Silent"" Myth: This stuff might work if you're already super successful and established. But when you're young  trying to build connections and find your way? It's poison. You need to express yourself  share experiences  be a bit vulnerable. That's how bonds form. Silence just breeds more loneliness.

And now  making friends feels almost impossible:

• First  there's my barrier against online/phone stuff. I need that physical interaction  which is already harder to find after college.

• Second  because of my mindset  I subconsciously look for friends who are also hyper-logical  ""classy "" and maybe a bit reserved. That's a tiny pool of people!

• Third  even if I meet someone potentially cool  I'm so stuck in my head and my ""rules"" that I don't really open up or bond easily. A friendship only happens if the other person is incredibly persistent and happens to be very similar to me  which is super rare.

My plea to anyone reading this who sees themselves in this:

Please  please try to change NOW. Don't wait. It only gets harder to unlearn these patterns. Let yourself be ""cringe."" Express yourself. It's okay to be imperfect  to be silly  to not always be logical or classy. Those things you suppress are probably the parts that will actually connect you to others.

Perfection is a bogus idea. It doesn't exist. Often  the people pushing you to be ""perfect"" are deeply imperfect themselves. And honestly  if someone genuinely thinks they are perfect  that's pretty solid proof they're not – because real growth involves knowing you're flawed.

Don't end up lonely in your seemingly ""fine"" life because you were too busy trying to be an idea instead of a person.

Hope this helps someone avoid this path. It's a lonely one.

loneliness,A stream of consciousness about loneliness,"So  I'll post here only because I don't want to stay in my head. I haven't gotten many responses in my posts so far  and I don't expect this time will be any different. But I just want to let it out.

I've felt lonely all my life  even at school  even when I had friends I frequently spent time with. Sometimes  for a while  I'd feel like I belonged  but mostly I'd be proven wrong soon later.

In November  my relationship ended. Honestly  the last few months it was obvious. We barely talked and saw each other. But I guess I wanted to believe there was a way to fix it. He didn't. I finally let him go. And that ending was similar to my prior relationships. 

I developed a bond with my family only too late. I am 27 now. Two years ago they had to move away  and I wish that happened organically instead of being forced by the home owner. I had to stay in the city due to my studies. Now I got a good job and friends here  but going to an empty home and having no one to talk about minor daily stuff hits hard suddenly.

I have dealt with depression  CPTSD  anxiety and panic attacks as a result of PTSD all my life. I was suicidal for a few years between the ages of 19-22. I'm not anymore. I've dedicated myself to teaching and learning - growth all the way. Some days I am proud of myself for how far I've come  but the deep talks at the end of a tiring and eventful day are where I feel a sense of belonging  and sometimes I have that with someone for a while  then it slips. 

I would love to stick around for someone through thick and thin  and I've got some friendships like that. But when everybody's busy with their own thing  me included  I understand the importance of a romantic relationship  a home to come to  much deeper. I feel like nobody will stick around for me like that.

I hold onto things so strongly. I knew I would be a teacher when I was a kid. I knew I wanted to live abroad for a while and I did. I knew I wanted a place of my own where I can build a small library and a nice study room  and although it's not a pinterest picture  I have it now. I know I hold onto people who hold onto me.

This is it. A lot of vagueness and a little disorganized  but as I said  I just wanted to get it off of my chest. ",3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1i0d80k/a_stream_of_consciousness_about_loneliness/
loneliness,Had a breakup while studying abroad and am feeling lonely and depressed since then.,"

Last year  I came to Germany for my masters. I have been pretty independent my whole life and being on my own didn’t bother me much. I was single when I came here and was focusing on my career and getting integrated into the culture. Cut to 3-4 months after that  I was approached by a guy from my uni and we did hit it off. It was clear from the beginning that we were dating for something serious. We had our ups and downs and it seemed he was not that serious into me. Now here  I made a mistake and kept giving this thing a try. I kept trying to put in more efforts but he would always disappoint me by canceling plans  telling me he feels pressure etc. Suddenly  things started getting better after 2-3 months and he changed a lot. But the lying and hiding things still continued. Here is when I became restless and was fighting with him out of frustration. Everything he did made me feel miserable about myself. One fine day  he ended things with me saying I am too emotional and he can’t take it anymore. It all came a day after he said he is lucky to have me. This sudden shock made me feel terrible. This was almost 4 months ago. I went through a lot of panic attacks and anxiety and it affected my studies and part-time job. Now  most of my friends have gone back to our home country and I am all alone here. I can’t help but feel lonely and miserable. A part of me still feels angry that while I am all sad and miserable here  he is enjoying his life to the fullest. The things which he couldn’t do with me because he had no time he is doing now while I have failed in my life and can’t even get out of bed. I don’t know what to do and where this situation will take me.",3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1hf192f/had_a_breakup_while_studying_abroad_and_am/
loneliness,When I tell people I'm lonely,"When I told people I was so lonely it physically hurt they looked at me weird.

When I told them it was hard to make friends no matter how many classes and events I signed up for  they told me to try harder.

When I told them I was afraid of dying alone  they told me to be more positive. 

When I told them loneliness gives me anxiety attacks they didn't know what to say.

loneliness,I can't even lie I'm lonely as F.,"So... How do you even begin such a thread? I'm 31  male  from Poland. I'm neurodivergent  depressed and have anxiety disorder (taking meds for this). I have a pretty good paying (but dead-endish) job  have my interests and hobbies. Love reading  music and other things. All my life I felt permeating loneliness and a feeling of difference from people both my age  older and younger... I can hold a conversation  but other people baffle me with things they actually care about. Especially younger people  who seem not even interested in talking to eachother  let alone me (in work etc). 

Being neurodivergent  but not diagnosed what exactly I ""have""  my Interests are pretty weird I admit  I play bass  guitar  some piano  can sing pretty good  love weird and old music  but can listen and appreciate normie music too. I love reading  making some kick ass coffee (v60  flair espresso etc)  have very good manual skills (I'm currently building a 3d printer of my own design from scratch  have built a bass guitar only using hand tools  can do home renovations etc  actually can do amazing massages too  since that's one of my Interests and I have read a few books/practiced a lot). I exercise - calisthenics and free weights  eat well (when I eat... Since my appetite fluctuates with depression episodes)  take care of myself  have a pretty good body imo (and my exes opinion too :p) except for my face... Which I feel is unattractive  as in not in the canon of beauty (big nose  no too prominent jaw and cheekbones) 

I had one serious partner. It was a love which was coming from both of us  she loved me and I loved her. The chemistry was amazing  sex was simply indescribably good. It was perfect. She was the most beautiful woman I have ever laid my eyes upon..Welp... Turned out she was married. We were ""together"" for six years. She also was suffering from depression  and She had laid off her meds  proclaimed that She wants to be pregna t with her husband. I was speechless. Maybe I'm dumb  but I still love her  despite this  and I doubt I can ever forget her embrace. She wanted to keep being together somehow  but for the good of her child I backed out. I want her to be happy  her child and husband to be happy too. For them to be complete... I took the hit on me completely it seems since when I check her FB page she seems to be happy. Since the break my depression evolved into actual wishing to die and self harm  poisoning myself  hating myself... I tried to take my life on multiple occasions. My mother took me to therapy  but after four different attempts with different specialists  no help could be found.

I actually feel like my death is imminent. My heart physically hurts  but I wont resist if I get a heart attack. During one of my attempts I took 2k mg dph and all of my antidepresants (hundreds od pills of duloxetine) but I'm still there somehow. 

Now I feel that all I do is wake up  go to work and try to talk with some people I think are as weird as I am  then go to sleep after work. Life is pretty much meaningless. I have a Tinder account with no matches (yes  I am dumb enough to actually pay for premium  boosts  superlikes etc) despite actually having pretty good photos considering my looks and having a good bio there  being nice and sincere with others... I don't understand it. My iq is 139 and my diagnosis is simple - I'm ugly. Personality  your status  heck even cock size dont matter at all when you are ugly. That's all she wrote and we can deceive ourselves if so we choose. So... Yeah I'm pretty sure that's what is on my mind right now.

Actually  I was texting a girl I know  we had good chemistry and all but got ghosted. Wtf is with peoples manners nowadays? I thought everything was good  but I was mistaken once again.

All I wish for right now is love  you know? I don't even mean sex  despite really liking making love and allegedly being really good at it (which I suspect was the reason Alice was with me  a weirdo  for so long?) but right now all I want is to love and be loved in return  like souls love eachother  care for eachother... Try to keep each other warm during this storm called life... But I feel like that's just past me. I'm done with it  but not from my choice. People call men like me ""incels"" I learn... I don't have anything in common with those men  but I do understand their loneliness  feelings of being an alien. In a way  I get the anger too  but I am not angry at women  I actually really care and am courteous even when I'm rejected. But... I just don't know what to say... Why even say anything. Don't you understand? I bet you do  since you are here. I want to talk with someone  I want to build a future for my wife  my kids. I cant do it goddammit :( I actually watch porn to see women smile and stuff since I can't make anyone smile in this way... It's really pathetic and I want to die thinking about that.

Yes... All that wall of text was written while crying  after work and laying in bath. I'm gonna clean myself up and get to bed I think  but if you wanna talk... Please talk to me (quoting Joni Mitchell)",7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1gfo50p/i_cant_even_lie_im_lonely_as_f/
loneliness,Convinced my self esteem is gone,"Sorry in advance if this is too long  I just don't feel like I can talk to anyone in my life about depression topics so I'm hurling this into the void. For some context  I(m31) have been back in single life for a little over a year now. I have of course experienced solitude for much longer spans than this  but the loneliness I've been feeling this time around has been almost unbearable at times. My most recent relationship had lasted almost 5 years and was emotionally damaging by the end. My ex was never too shy or hesitant to tell me when they thought I was being weird or annoying. Their relationship with their phone was always more significant than our own  to the point that I all but gave up on trying to make plans for us because we either wouldn't see them through or I'd be spending the entire date third wheeling with them and their phone. Our incompatibility manifested entirely when they eventually told me that if I desired physical or emotional intimacy of any kind  I had to be the one instigating it 100% of the time because they had no interest and wouldn't have been affected if we never touched or spoke to each other at all. Despite all of this  I was keeping with the relationship. In part  because I was dreading being alone again  but I also did still love them. I didn't want it to end  but it was pushed over that line when they decided to cheat on me with someone who was 18. Not only was this a matter of behavior I couldn't tolerate  but it also sank my self esteem to a point that it has not recovered from. Now  I feel as though I'm just sort of drifting. I go to work  I run my errands  I eat my food  and my weekends are almost exclusively spent in front of a screen of some kind. My attempts to try putting myself back out there have only served to worsen my self esteem. Between constant ghosting situations on dating apps and rejections overall  I feel no confidence when it comes to speaking to anyone in any sort of dating capacity. When I experience a crush  I'm more likely to just try forcing myself to not think about it because I work myself into an anxiety attack just trying to form a way to start conversation that isn't completely awkward or embarrassing. I also feel like if I don't get over that  I'll be stuck in this stasis indefinitely because meeting people via the internet seems to be the only way it happens now. I just don't feel as though I am something that anyone out there is looking for  and with the passage of time I'm agreeing more and more that there isn't much to me that is very appealing. I don't believe I am good enough and the last thing I want to be is another waste of time to someone.

Is there a way to get over this hurdle?",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1g7y77m/convinced_my_self_esteem_is_gone/
loneliness,Now  I am completely alone  and it's hard. ,"I don’t know if this is the right subreddit  or even why I’m posting. I think I just need to vent somewhere and I don’t really have anyone left in my life to share with. So instead of a physical human connection I’m resorting to the vast anonymity of the internet. This is going to be long  so I don’t even expect anyone will read through it. But I don’t have anywhere else to dump all this right now… 

I’m a 49 yr old European woman  born and raised in the cold North of the continent  but now I live on a sunny and hot Mediterranean island. I’ve been here for 11 years  so this is home now. 

Literally the first weekend I was here  I met a man. It took me 38 years of my life to find the perfect partner for me  and here he was. Right in front of me and it was one of those meetings where a friendship was instant. Kindred spirits and it was like we’d known eachother forever. I was happy. He was happy. His family was less happy that I was foreigner  not Catholic and have tattoos. Anyway  we were happy - so many ideas and plans for the future and growing old together. We were a perfect match and I really wish we’d met 20 years earlier. 

*Then life happened:* 

3 years ago  in July 21  the love of my life passed from cancer. He was diagnosed only 7 months earlier in January  so it went quick. He fought like a lion  and he passed at home in our bed  painfree and in mid-sentence. His heart gave up that day and I don’t think he knew what was happening then and there. He was just wondering what we were eating that evening  that was his very last words: “What are we eating tonight?”. As far as final last words go  seeing as he was a HUGE foodie - I find it suitable for him to go with thoughts of lovely food in his mind. 

The grief was enormous. I had one of my sister stay with me for a few months after  just to keep me company and to watch over me so I didn’t do anything stupid to myself. I will forever be immensely grateful to her for that  she is a good human. 

I have never been so lost and broken ever in my life. Healing is  and was slow. But I felt I was getting somewhere this year. Moving forward. Having genuine smiles. Less “fake-it-until-you-make-it” and so on. 

*Then lightning strikes twice in a few months:* 

My mom passed in February 24. She had had health issues  and I don’t think she was happy her last couple of years. So even though the grief was deep  I could see that this was probably a relief for her to be leaving. I don’t think she had anything positive in her life the last 3 or 4 years  if she did she never told me about it. So even though I was grieving the loss  I could see that this was maybe the best thing for her. It wasn’t a long drawn out process in hospital for her  it was like she just gave up after contracting an infection that would normally be easily cleared up. 

We had a good relationship now  after some very rocky years when I was in my 20s  and she was “a bit” overbearing and meddling in my life on every level. From romantic relationships to work and everything in between. We were LC for a while  but all this has been resolved for well over a decade. And even though she herself  probably welcomed her demise  it was hard for me. 

Now who to turn to for advice or a silly conversation when I’m blue? Who has all the recipes of the food I miss from my childhood? Who can I call that will know exactly how I’m feeling from just hearing me say “Hi  it’s me”. 

Then in the end of May  my dad left us  and this was an absolute shock to everyone. He had no health issues  strong as an ox  happy in his life with his new partner and spending half the year in Spain. Lots of plans for holidays  and the last conversation I had with him we were talking about the Euros  and how we would really like to go to the  next one in UK/Ireland in 2028. So there was absolutely NO indication that things were not right with him. In fact it was opposite  he was in better shape since he started exercising with some other old guys at the local gym. 

He had a stroke  followed by a heart attack and then another stroke when they tried to take him out of the induced coma. He got sick on a Wednesday  and passed on the Sunday. 

I made it back to my native country before he passed. I got to see him in the hospital. But I don’t think he knew any of us were there. I hope he didn’t know what was going on and that the last thing in his memory was going to bed with a woman he loved the night before and not any of the things that was done in the hospital. 

To top everything off - one of my 3 siblings (F65  M60 and F56) has lost their mind and so now we’re also in a situation where siblings are talking to siblings through lawyers. Myself and the sister that was here with me are still texting a bit  but I now have no family left and it doesn’t seem like anyone gives a flying fig how I’m doing or even if I made it safe back to my island. Nobody has called since I came back here about a 3 weeks ago now. 

My adult nieces and nephews haven’t really kept in touch over the years  so at some point I stopped trying to be a part of their lives as well. I don’t even think they noticed that Christmas gifts  bday greetings/gifts etc stopped coming. 

I have 8 nieces and nephews  and between the 3 oldest of them - I also have 9 great nieces and nephews.   
4 of them I’ve never met. 4 I met when I invited myself to my nieces house on my way through her county. And the last one I met at my moms house when she was still alive. I was so hurt when I was never invited to christenings for their kids or their weddings  as I don’t have kids myself and doted on these 8 as much as I could. 

The oldest great nieces and nephews are coming up to confirmation age now soon - I don’t expect an invite to that either. This hurts me. I’ve always tried to be there for my family members and I’ve been understanding that since they have full family lives  spinster aunts are not on the radar. It still hurts my feelings though. Especially my oldest niece  I babysat her since she came out! I was there when she learned how to walk  talk and I supported that child in any way I could since her parents were - well  less than awesome - and also very young when she came. I love her as my own  since Mother Nature did not have children in her plans for me. 

She now has 4 kids  beautiful children from what I can see from pictures on Facebook. But they do not know  me  and I do not know them. I don’t exist in my own family. Probably my own doing since I’ve been moving around Europe a lot since about 2000. The wanderlust is real  and I wanted to live somewhere else. But I have really tried from my end to keep a relationship with all these people  but it has been onesided. 

**Now I’m in the middle of a mental breakdown. A huge one  I’ve never experienced anything like it.** 

I’ve spoken to mental health services  but am on waiting list for a therapist. In the meantime I get “Emotional Support Service” - basically this is a person who has training in psychology  but are not warranted yet and can not prescribe etc. But they can listen  advise and be a safe space. So  I’ve started the process of getting help  because I can not deal with this by myself anymore. It seems I have lost myself completely in this. All progress made after my partners passing has been wiped out. 

It’s like I don’t even know who the hell I am now. 

So here I am. Almost 50  alone and I’ve ended up as a cat lady. My late partner had 4 cats  so obviously they stayed with me. That is all I have after him. That and my  memories. His adult son and ex wife took everything. They even picked up his socks and underwear  so I have nothing left from him other than the cats and my memories. He gave me a beautiful  antique necklace for my 40th  from his mothers collection. His ex even tried getting that back from me  but since there was both photos and a short vid of him gifting it to me for my birthday  she couldn’t get that. It’s fine though  I was loved. Unconditionally and truthfully. 

Through him I saw myself through HIS eyes. I saw strength and beauty I didn’t know was there. And without that I wouldn’t have survived his illness and passing. I’ve proven myself stronger than I thought I could be these last 3 years. But now I am flailing  and failing. I can’t help myself right now. I’ve been in therapy before so I have a toolbox - but none of the tools can deal with all that is going on. 

The anxiety is beyond anything I’ve ever experienced. 

Then there is work  and that is adding a whole metric ton of anxiety as well: 

I started a new job  on-site position mid April. Just about 5 weeks before my dad passed. I felt I was ready to go back to the office  after having worked remotely since 2019. Until all this happened  that was OK. A huge shock to the system to have to commute  plan my day etc; and not just get up  have coffee and log on. But it was good for me to break the cycle of isolation that comes with wfh. 

The job is just that - a job. I used to be passionate about my profession  but that seems to have gone as well lately. I used to take pride in my work  and be proactive in my workplace. Now I just show up  and wait for the hours to pass. As a matter of fact  I am writing this at my desk in the office  I’m supposed to be doing other shit. So it’s a form of self-sabotage I guess but I don’t have the energy to fight myself on it. I know I’m wrong. I know I shouldn’t do this. And I know that this behaviour can have serious consequences. Still - I just do it. 

I’m still on my probationary contract. I’ve burned through all my holidays  and a couple of unpaid days of leave as well;  to get some time to try to “fix myself” etc  but it didn’t do much. I’m still chronically fatigued  but can’t sleep. No appetite and I forget to eat  shower or do my laundry.  I can burst into tears for no reason  and when it first starts I cant stop. We’re not talking some cute  feminine little sob - we’re talking full on  uncontrollable ugly-cry. It’s like I am so incredibly fragile these days  and it is a feeling I resent. This is all depression symptoms - I know… Once I get into therapy I will deal with it. 

I’ve lived on my own  and taken care of myself  since I was 17 years old. Always worked  never got the higher education I dreamt of  but I carved out a little life for myself. It was an ok little life  but now the path is gone and I don’t have any energy to look for it again. I’ve tried to be a positive person  and I can usually spin anything into something positive. 

I just need a few months off. Completely off to rebuild myself  with no responsibilities to anything other than healing. An impossible pipedream  I know.

But since I’m alone  and responsible for all my expenses etc - I can’t. Rent needs to be paid  the cats need feeding and I should probably eat too. (Feeding the pets is more important than myself though. I’m pretty good at food prep and bulk shopping so I always have a dinner or two in the freezer. ) Since my beloveds passing  I live paycheck to paycheck. There is just about enough in the check to get from one month to the other. I have no security net to catch me if/when I fall. No savings left since I had to get a lawyer to try to get something from my beloved  but I lost. His ex is a judge  so obviously I was always going to lose. But I had to try to get them to respect his wishes  they just didn't.

I also have nowhere to go now  if I fall through the net here. Returning back to Northern Europe and my native country is not an option. I have no one left up there who would even care if I were to move back. I’d be just as alone in my misery there. I’ve also been so long out of the country that the social benefits and so on wouldn’t be enough to even begin to cover costs of that country. 

My best friend from childhood also rents and her space isn’t big enough for us to share if I head back. She’d never kick me out  but I know that a couple of weeks of sharing her space and the friendship might suffer. I can’t lose her as well. 

I have no idea how to move on to some sort of semblance of a little life. I know that in the coming weeks and months I will get better with the help of therapists etc. But it is still 6-8 weeks before I can expect that to happen. Private therapists are from €60 - €100  and I can’t swing that on a weekly basis. So I have to wait for the subsidized services. My GP has prescribed some anti anxiety meds  they will hopefully kick in soon  but I just started this week. 

I’m so so terrified that I will lose my job. I mean  I can totally get it from their POV: 

You hire a new hire and 5-6 weeks later  that employee literally falls apart. Here  probation is 6 months  and during probation they don’t really need a reason to terminate. And termination is then usually immediate and on the day. The only reason why they are a little careful right now  is that I have been open with them about what is going on  and I have the emails to prove that I have kept them updated about my mental health and what is going on in my life. Obviously  firing someone with mental health issues will give you a bad rep with the labour authorities here. I hope the paranoid feeling I have is wrong and that they will not. But I can’t relax  I can’t focus  I’m not great at completing my tasks and tickets at the moment - I wouldn’t hire me right now! I’m a useless husk of a human… 

Everything is just fear right now. I just wish it would all be over. I’m so tired and sad all the time. There is nothing I look forward to. There is nothing I can think of that I can go do that will bring me some joy. I don’t really have any hobbies right now either  since I don’t have any energy to spend on anything. 

I live in a Mediterranean paradise  summer is here and the sun is beating down and the sea is inviting. I’ve not been ot the beach once this year. I see the beauty  and I can smell the sea - normally that would bring me joy. I used to head to the beach every evening around sunset to cool off and enjoy the water. It was my daily outing in the summers  almost every single day. Now I just do not care. I don’t really care about anything tbh. 

I go out when I need to  i.e work  appointments and shopping that can not be delivered. Most of my stuff is on delivery though  so I don’t even have to go out for toilet paper or bread. I’ve isolated myself so much since my love passed. I’ve done this to myself  so I guess I deserve the rough end of the stick now. For 8 years I had everything I ever wanted adn needed. Now  for 3 years  I have nothing. I hate being this self pitying person  but I am so overwhelmed. 

If I wasn’t responsible for the health and safety of the cats I probably wouldn’t be here today. But they also lost the most important person in their life  so I have to stick it out as long as the  babies are here. And in that time  hopefully heal. 

If anyone made it to the end - thank you for reading the ramblings of a woman on the edge. I’ll do my best to hang on to this edge until I can pull myself back up on solid ground by my finger nails. I just hope I can manage that.

loneliness,After severe bipolar disorder episodes decided to live a lonely life aka Secular Nun,"Tldr; My behaviors suffering from bipolar disorder and anxiety disorder and not being able to buffer my severe mood swings and panic attacks ""adequately"" (so that mainstream society isn't shocked  repulsed etc.) led me to the decision of living a lonely life from now on  aka like a Secular Nun. I kept exactly 1 longtime friend  who doesn't have any mental disabilities as far as I can tell  but is character-wise ""a crazy cookie"" and who can absolutely ""deal with me and my behaviors"" in any mood. I decided to never again have a romantic relationship (I am 44)  because this also seems to be  incompatible with my life and diseases. I turn to Reddit for finding hopefully like-minded people and temporary friends. Yay to the rest of my life :)

loneliness,I can’t handle it anymore ,"The worst derealisation and depression l've ever experienced in my entire life it feels like im already dead. This is the loneliest l've ever been  everyone I know is in a relationship all I want is a girl to love me  i can't handle seeing everyone I know on instagram and Snapchat posting pictures of their partners  I have no friends  I spend my days alone on my computer doing fuck all  I live throughout the day just to make it to nighttime where I can have 8 hours of ignorant peace away from the loneliness and derealisation. My speech is getting worse  always stuttering my words  im constantly tired. It feels like I'm slowly dying.
I used to get really bad anxiety with my derealisation attacks where my heart would palpitate  I found it hard to breathe and I had a panic attack in fear that I was dying - but that doesn't even happen anymore. I want to die.
I don't even care for having friends  or a good career  or to be rich  all I want is a wite and child in life. But for now I just want a girltriend to make her my wife and it feels like l'll never have that and without that there is no point in living",5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1clt3vr/i_cant_handle_it_anymore/
loneliness,Found my (huge) rambling comment of 2 years ago on a YT video,"I was pre HRT and quite sad and stuff. Dark. Some of my views have changed  but anyhow I feel I've been so cute. It's replying to a video that treats lonely people as pathetic  and the YT girl still didn't changed and done same insults on a new video 6 months ago. She is  by what it looks like  actively thinking that people with sad life just are lazy and don't make an effort. ""So pathetic"" describes it the best. 

So  this is my 2-years-old comment.

&#x200B;

*""Well yes... but actually no.* 

*I might be a singularity and have a strong case of dramatic life but I don't think I'm gonna cure myself alone.*  

&#x200B;

*Since 6 I've been struggling with dyspraxia in my school journey  all kid bullied me and teachers mostly said about me that I'm lazy cause I can't write at their speed. I can't write correctly (French specific rules of grammar and stuff doesn't help about the difficulties) anything  I can't move correctly and ""EPS"" (""Education physique et sportive"") is my worst nightmare.* 

*For two hours  there's no rules  no safety  only aggressions. All the time. First you sit and listen to the teacher  and everyone looking at my like I'm less than trash. Then you get noted on how you can do gymnastic things. The thing is  like I've said  I can't move correctly.  It's like if you want a blind to describe you the colors you but on the board. It's like you note someone who can't use their legs  their capacity to run a 100m. You won't get anything from it.* 

*Then you got running. I was judged on my capacity to run as a male. The thing is  I'm not. I might sound like a gatekeeper  but sorry  I'm not a male. I've got poor legs  not specially efficient lungs  and a shape of a trash  and just small in general. Duh  I'm sorry I can't run like Flash  I'm only a human. Or a trash. I don't know. But you can't judge me like this and say that people should deal with their feelings. Lol I've lost my soul a long time ago  you're a little late sorry.*  

&#x200B;

*I've always been in my own bubble  in my own world  very childish or playful and not manly enough like they say  and got bullied a lot. Anyway  I was thinking maybe women don't care about physical appearance and what's outside. LOL. I don't count all times I was calling gay (which make not sense cause I was attracted to women by the time  maybe they already did the gender swap that was coming next?)  I don't count times where chads said ""We only want real man here"" and looking at me very meanly  or times where girls walked with their group of friends around me and said how much I'm not manly enough  how I wouldn't never find a single girl who likes me (which is true.).* 

*With all that  for a long time  I was seriously thinking that I'm in a fictional universe or in a simulation  that I'm the only person who as feelings  in a world filled with NPC that can just repeat some actions such as their stupid social games and bullying people who have a serious problem: They're nice.* 

*And it's not to put a step-father who make you feel like trash too and not showing love and care a single time. Just imagine...*  

&#x200B;

*When I try remember when I did wanted to live  it was never. All my life. All the places. Not a single human. Just robot  deserving an experience where alien scientists looking how much harm a human soul can take in the life.*  

&#x200B;

*Turns out that I'm a transwoman. Since I was 10 I was dreaming I turn into a girl. (Praying all nights in bed the non-existent god to do something about it  I mean  I don't know  your prayers trying to tell me you're nice  so I don't know  act like a nice god?) I don't know about America or most of the countries  but here in France  I couldn't take the pressure. It's too hard. I can't be a man  that's all. Don't harass me like if I'm not a good man. I can't be. Just please stop.*  

*And no one would've stop.* 

*Every single time. Everywhere. Like  I know I'm not a man  why you're trying to make me be one? It's not stating even more pressure face to chads. It's like attacking a tank with your claws. I don't know  I kind of know the end of all of this.* 

*I don't want to imagine what's like in Russia or Algeria. The pressure of competition to be a manly men would make me blow up instantly. There is no possibility for me. There is no tiles where I can live. I'm useless. French women have so much high standards  I can't compete. It's like if you make a F1 race with a 10 times world champion against someone who never drived once. How you think it's gonna ending? What can I do?* 

*I mean  who wants someone who have disabilities and social anxiety  very childish  very girlish  would never make a single move with women cause too shy  not masc  or maybe just not a man at all  someone who can't work or be in the society like everyone else...*  

&#x200B;

*So yeah. I would like to deal with my emotions. But I can't. I would like to get through all of this  but it's incurable. Again  WHO in the WORLD would take care of me  a disabled transwoman who will never be able to live and feel cause of a broken heart and a broken soul.  Try to make me feel good with myself now. Good luck.""*

&#x200B;

Gosh I'd just like to hug that girl so tight. 

""Shhhh. Calm down  darling  calm down. It's okay  it's okay. You're gay  that's all. You're a denied lesbian. But it's okay now. I'm here for you.. Don't worry.. I'm here with you.."" 😌

No  its not my fault. I didn't chose this. All of this. I just thought we'd all like to hear it. It's okay. It's not your fault. I am not responsible for living in a mean society under my pressured identity. And you should verywell know that.

So please know that how ever hard time it is  I will always be here for a hug.",3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/14q0fju/found_my_huge_rambling_comment_of_2_years_ago_on/

loneliness,Rise and shine  it’s panic attack time,"Waking up to a daily panic attack because I miss her feels like my mind and body are at war with each other. It’s as if  in sleep  I find a moment of peace  a temporary escape  but then I wake up with my heart pounding  gasping for air  as if it’s only now realizing the void she left behind. The memories flood in—the way she smiled  the sound of her laughter  her morning hugs—and they’re like ghosts haunting me the moment I open my eyes  catching me off guard  hitting me where I thought I was finally starting to feel numb.

Each day starts in pieces  shattered by that wave of loss that crashes down on me before I’m even fully awake. It’s exhausting  because I go to bed in the one we had shared for years hoping tomorrow will be different  hoping I’ll wake up without feeling like my chest is caving in. But the cycle keeps repeating  and I don’t know how much more I can take. It’s like I’m being slowly worn down  hollowed out by this endless ache  and I don’t know how to stop it.

I do believe that without school or any kind of job my motivation to live  eat  drink  and keep up hygiene  would go away. during the summer i developed a fear of seeing new people  not diagnosed but i still had fear of people i didn't know seeing me.

loneliness,A stream of consciousness about loneliness,"So  I'll post here only because I don't want to stay in my head. I haven't gotten many responses in my posts so far  and I don't expect this time will be any different. But I just want to let it out.

I've felt lonely all my life  even at school  even when I had friends I frequently spent time with. Sometimes  for a while  I'd feel like I belonged  but mostly I'd be proven wrong soon later.

In November  my relationship ended. Honestly  the last few months it was obvious. We barely talked and saw each other. But I guess I wanted to believe there was a way to fix it. He didn't. I finally let him go. And that ending was similar to my prior relationships. 

I developed a bond with my family only too late. I am 27 now. Two years ago they had to move away  and I wish that happened organically instead of being forced by the home owner. I had to stay in the city due to my studies. Now I got a good job and friends here  but going to an empty home and having no one to talk about minor daily stuff hits hard suddenly.

I have dealt with depression  CPTSD  anxiety and panic attacks as a result of PTSD all my life. I was suicidal for a few years between the ages of 19-22. I'm not anymore. I've dedicated myself to teaching and learning - growth all the way. Some days I am proud of myself for how far I've come  but the deep talks at the end of a tiring and eventful day are where I feel a sense of belonging  and sometimes I have that with someone for a while  then it slips. 

I would love to stick around for someone through thick and thin  and I've got some friendships like that. But when everybody's busy with their own thing  me included  I understand the importance of a romantic relationship  a home to come to  much deeper. I feel like nobody will stick around for me like that.

I hold onto things so strongly. I knew I would be a teacher when I was a kid. I knew I wanted to live abroad for a while and I did. I knew I wanted a place of my own where I can build a small library and a nice study room  and although it's not a pinterest picture  I have it now. I know I hold onto people who hold onto me.

This is it. A lot of vagueness and a little disorganized  but as I said  I just wanted to get it off of my chest. ",3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1i0d80k/a_stream_of_consciousness_about_loneliness/

loneliness,Had a breakup while studying abroad and am feeling lonely and depressed since then.,"

Last year  I came to Germany for my masters. I have been pretty independent my whole life and being on my own didn’t bother me much. I was single when I came here and was focusing on my career and getting integrated into the culture. Cut to 3-4 months after that  I was approached by a guy from my uni and we did hit it off. It was clear from the beginning that we were dating for something serious. We had our ups and downs and it seemed he was not that serious into me. Now here  I made a mistake and kept giving this thing a try. I kept trying to put in more efforts but he would always disappoint me by canceling plans  telling me he feels pressure etc. Suddenly  things started getting better after 2-3 months and he changed a lot. But the lying and hiding things still continued. Here is when I became restless and was fighting with him out of frustration. Everything he did made me feel miserable about myself. One fine day  he ended things with me saying I am too emotional and he can’t take it anymore. It all came a day after he said he is lucky to have me. This sudden shock made me feel terrible. This was almost 4 months ago. I went through a lot of panic attacks and anxiety and it affected my studies and part-time job. Now  most of my friends have gone back to our home country and I am all alone here. I can’t help but feel lonely and miserable. A part of me still feels angry that while I am all sad and miserable here  he is enjoying his life to the fullest. The things which he couldn’t do with me because he had no time he is doing now while I have failed in my life and can’t even get out of bed.

loneliness,I've been alone for years and I think it's going to kill me,"This is going to be a long post so I'm sorry if it's too much to read but I've got to get this out somewhere.

I'm 22 and I've been alone and without friends for years now and it's eating me from the inside. I've found myself often crying for no reason and my heart aching for something I'm afraid I'll never have. I have no one I can talk to  no one I can vent to or anyone who would care to hear. I've tried to convince myself I'd be okay being alone and that I could learn to ""love myself"" as I've heard being suggested alot but it doesn't work. Humans aren't meant to be this lonely  this isolated. It's killing me. I've tried to do something about it like going out and trying to meet people  that hasn't worked either. I tried to go to a meetup social nearby a few months ago but when I got there everyone was already grouped up with eachother and I didn't want to be the annoying one trying to weasel their way into their already established friend groups. I ended up sitting alone outside for 20 minutes waiting for an uber to pick me up. I was so ashamed and hated myself for it and ended up having a panic attack so bad I had to go to the hospital for fear I was having a heart attack. I know that I should've just tried to talk to someone there but I was so afraid of being rejected or being seen as annoying or invasive that I just froze and... couldn't do it. After years of social isolation I have very little social skills  I can't hold a conversation which leads to awkward silences that I'm deathly afraid of and never know what to say. It doesn't help that I'm not exactly an attractive person to look at. I don't think I'm horrendous but I'm 6'2 302lbs (I used to be 350 before I started my weight loss journey in February). I have essentially 0 self confidence and I'm pretty sure others can sense that pretty easily.

I've also never been in a relationship. I'm a virgin at 22  I've never kissed anyone or even held hands with anyone and it makes me feel so worthless and pathetic. And due to my size I feel like I can't even attempt to change that until I've gotten to a proper  healthy size which I'm working on but it's going to be a long time until I've reached my goal. I don't even care about the sex part anymore really  I just want to be held or to hold someone close so badly that it physically hurts to think about I'm so starved of affection. Just a hug would be heaven at this point.


I feel so empty and hopeless and whilst I know I'm not the only one in the world that feels this way  it truly does feel like it for me. Every where I look I see groups of friends and couples and they all seem so...happy. I find myself bitter and angry at the world even though it's nobody's fault but my own. I see happy friends and couples and I feel hatred towards them  simply because they're happy and I'm not. I don't like feeling like that  it's not their fault I'm like this. 

I don't know what to do but I know I can't go on like this much longer. I don't think I'm suicidal  I'm too much of a coward to do it I think  but there's only so much pain and emptiness a person can take. 

I pray to whatever God's are out there that no one else has to feel like this  it's hell. I'm sorry for such a long post.

I hope you're all doing better than me  even if I'll hate you for it.",26,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1f6848s/ive_been_alone_for_years_and_i_think_its_going_to/
loneliness,The Terror of Morning Light,"Waking up every day with my first thoughts consumed by her feels like being pulled under a relentless tide before I’ve even had a chance to breathe. The terror strikes fast. My heart pounds  my chest tightens  and my mind races  desperately grasping for some kind of stability in a world that feels shattered. Mornings are cruel; they don’t give me time to prepare  to arm myself against the memories or the ache that floods in without warning.

The panic is immediate and overwhelming  as if my body remembers the loss before my mind is even fully awake. It’s not just sadness. Rather  it’s a consuming dread  a sharp edge of fear that pierces through the haze of sleep. The bed  instead of being a place of comfort  feels suffocating. My thoughts spiral out of control: Will I ever feel normal again? Was she the one? How do I live without her?

The physical symptoms of panic take over. (Shallow breaths  trembling  that awful feeling that I might never escape this cycle of pain.) It’s terrifying  and I dread mornings because they’ve become a predictable ambush of grief and terror that I can’t seem to avoid. Ironically  the daily morning hugs that she used to give me would erase all of this. 

What makes it worse is the loneliness that follows. The sense that no one else could possibly understand how deeply this hurts  how frightening it is to wake up feeling like this every single day makes it worse. It’s exhausting in a way I can’t fully explain  and some mornings  it feels like I’m barely holding on. Especially the ones where I have nothing planned for the day and nowhere to go.

But somewhere deep inside  I have to remind myself that panic attacks aren’t forever. They feel endless in the moment  but they pass. This pain  this fear  this grief  I suppose it’s part of my healing  even though it doesn’t feel that way right now. I don’t know how long it will take  but I want to believe that mornings can become bearable again. I’m trying to hold on to that.",5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1h4j25a/the_terror_of_morning_light/
loneliness,V lonely and sad ,"Guys I’m very lonely and sad. 

All my “friends” betrayed me. I got to know this just when my manager told me that I might have to be let go sometime soon and that it’s not my fault  the company just had to let some people go. I don’t tell my parents cuz they stress too much. I tell my bf with whom I do LDR  he was supportive initially. Then now he came to the same city  he went to hang out w his friends  I wasn’t feeling okay and wanted someone to talk to still  I wanted him to atleast talk to me if not do anything else. I am sceptical about his friends being bad company and used to get panic attacks whenever he’d go with them. 
Today again I wanted him to be there for me in spite of him gone w those friends  and told him I feel lonely  however he still doesn’t seem to respond so frequently or anything and I’ve got a panic attack again after a very long time. 

He’s been there for me on other days when he’s at home  am I not supposed to expect him to be there if he’s out even when I still feel shit? 

Am I stupid to expect someone to check on me always? Am I asking for too much?

I’ve tried making boyfriends but boys they never pay too much attention  the like me for a week and just forget about me   I try to hard and maybe I’m too desperate to have a bf but I’ve never had a real one   I’ve never had a real relationship with a guy   it’s always just one sided   there’s so much I could feel I could love   I want my younger self to know she has me   but unless I have myself I don’t think anybody can have me .

I’ve become a very miserable  moody   irritable person and the more I look at myself the more I get disgusted and disappointed  I wish I was more social and I wish I got along with people   I wish the body of mine could feel the warmth of another human over her   I wish she felt safer in arms of other humans she cared for   other humans she loved   until then she just has to stay in the own arms and wait for someone to find her and love her ",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1fjug75/i_feel_empty_everyday_and_every_time_and_every/

loneliness,[Long post] Everything feels empty after a recent incident I had,"Hi everyone 

I am 27 and been lonely for my whole life. No girlfriends  not even a close interaction with any girl  few friends who are now living at somewhere else so I see them rarely. I am an introvert and have social anxiety. I do everything alone. I go for coffee alone  restaurant alone  I go to movies alone  everything.

But unlike most of you (at least I believe so)  I was happy with this. You can say ""no way"" but please bear with me. I was happy that I am not dependent on someone else  I can only care for myself  do what I want at anytime  no responsibility etc. Yet I can't help myself but feel like this is changed due to a recent event.

Despite being lonely  I work full time at an office so I am (physically) with people most of the time and I get along with them very well. But the relationship is limited to work  after 5 pm we rarely text or call  each other. We sometimes have happy hours or parties and that's it.

However  my relationship with one girl at the office is special. We get along really well and talk about other stuff than work  I really be happier when I see her at the office and the feeling is mutual. But neve once  I felt anything more than a friendship nor I have seen any signs from her for something more.

But that changed during one of the parties I mentioned above. To keep it short  we were at a friend's house at around 4 am in the morning  she was very drunk and I am also drunk  she took me to a room and she said she loves me  asks for a relationship and starts kissing me (yep  first kiss at 27). I stopped her and said think about this and let's talk again when you are sober because no matter how unexperienced I am  I felt that it was not her genuine feelings but effects of alcohol.

The next day she calls me and apologizes by saying she should not pressure me into anything and a relationship should occur naturally  if it will ever be. At this point  I thought despite I like being on my own and a relationship is too much of a commitment  since I get along with her  I should at least try it. This is first in 27 years so it is likely that I may never have another chance in my life. 

I also talked with some friends about this and they all said she likes you  it is a move she made and I should go talk to her. Motivated by this  I thought it is my part to act so I need to talk to her. Unfortunately  that talk was delayed by 2 weeks because she was on leave and I wanted to do it face-to face. During that 2 weeks  combined with my chronic loneliness  inexperience  social anxiety and paranoia  my mental health really collapsed. I though the future talk at least 100000 times all day and night. During that time I tried texting her and she never talked about this. I thought I still needed to talk to her  my patience ended and I called her.

She told me that she was not ready for a relationship  she consider me as her friend and she is up for spending time together. I said okay but after this talk  everything seemed to change for me. Now I feel like empty  like nothing has a point if I cannot share that with someone else. I work  play games  watch sports matches  movies  shows like I used to but all this feels like I am just wasting my time until death. Nothing has a point and I want something more from life  someone to share with. Not necessarily that girl but just someone.

With that thoughts in my mind  I got drunk this Friday and talked to her being totally honest saying you messed me up  you rejected me these are all fine but now I cannot enjoy anything I want myself from 2 weeks back  I want the relatively ""happy"" me. I want to enjoy my free time etc. I just asked her to help me and she said she thought she was clear about boundaries so I should not have thought on this again and also added me to give it some time and I will be back to my old self.

After talking to her  I felt better for a while but now it is starting all over again. I just sit and home and do the stuff I used to do my whole life but it is not ""fun"" anymore. I feel like a plant just passing time.

How can I be my old  ""happy to be alone"" self?

Apologies for the long post and taking your time. Thanks in advance.",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/yno8v5/long_post_everything_feels_empty_after_a_recent/

loneliness,My dog just died and I am visiting my parents and I feel so empty,"I feel like I am nowhere. I have a lot to be grateful for  but I keep looking on social media seeing people with their partners and I wish I had that tonight. Instead  on a Friday  I feel so alone. I adore my parents but they have each other and I want a partner so bad too. I know I have to get out there  but that is work and risk and energy and frankly I’m scared and tired. 

I also feel so empty now that my beloved dog is gone. It just happened so it’s raw  but he was a big part of my world and now I just have his memory. 

Again  trying to be positive  but feeling really empty. Craving connection with someone I like. Craving that my life move forward in that way. Craving that I realize my potential and dreams and self don’t have so much pent up inside. Craving that I can maintain confidence and apply my talent and achieve great things and most of all  be acknowledged. 

But I also just really miss my dog on a Friday night and don’t have any plans and I feel like a loser. 

Sorry I know that was an unedited mess. It’s a lot. But I just wanted to put that out into the void in hopes that SOMEONE would relate to SOMETHING. 

I took my other dog and went for a drive to run an errand that I didn’t really need  just to get out of the house. I have so much on my mind. My parents and their friends are going to dinner and want me to go but that sounds tiring.",14,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/ejquzo/my_dog_just_died_and_i_am_visiting_my_parents_and/

loneliness,Moving away,"Do you think changing scenery or moving would change the feeling of loneliness? 

15 years ago I emigrated from South America to Europe. My dream was to live in my fathers hometown on a small island where he was born and reconnect with his extended family. I wanted to belong there and identify being from there. 
Things didn’t really work out because I had problems in my job where I faced severe workplace bullying that gave me PTSD and burnout and I basically ended up in therapy for 2 years trying to overcome the grief of losing that life plan. I had to move to a big city on the mainland where I thrived professionally  got the mental help I needed and did achieve every aspect of my professional life. However  city people can be cold and difficult to break in. Even though  I do have a good relationship with the people here  I feel city connections are empty and after the pandemic  the loneliness and empty feeling got worse. 
The fact that I’ve never had a meaningful relationship with a man in my life is probably the biggest pain I have to endure. It hurts my soul  and even though I’ve tried to overcome it with a myriad of activities and hobbies  I cannot get over it. 
I think last June  the loneliness got worse. I tried even getting into extreme sports to get a dopamine hit  since Im now on GLP-1s and I can’t even self medicate with food anymore because I literally feel no hunger and can’t even get pleasure from even eating my favorite foods anymore. The anxiety combined with Ozempic makes food taste like cardboard. Men want me of course  just to fk me. Nobody wants to be part of life despite working on myself  taking care of myself  working out and being successful- turns out maybe I’m too much for a man. 
I got an idea into my head 2 months ago that maybe I should transfer and try again to build a life on my fathers hometown  to be with family. People are more open there  being a small  and all and the weather is super nice and sunny year round. Even though  that place hurt me in the past; I’m successful now- I’m stronger professionally. 
Maybe changing scenery will make me stop feeling lonely ",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1joqpjo/moving_away/
loneliness,I hate my life and want to end it,"Idk why I am typing this... just created this account because I am this desperate for help. 

Everything in my life is shit. I just don't know what to do anymore.. I feel like killing myself..
I can't even stick to my workout schedule because I am this suicidal.. I hate eating. It's the same shit everyday and also exhausting. The fact that I am human also disgusts me in a way. I am just ashamed of myself.. I have noone. My dad died last year.. my birthgiver on the other hand who I live with is an abuse piece of ... (not gonna call names although I would want to say so much bad shit about this person.. ugh feel like vomiting)... literally traumatized by her. I believe that she is a narcissist. 

Anyways.. regardless of that I can't find to seem joy in life anymore. Everything is draining me. Feel like a piece of fat shit and am afraid of loosing my muscles that I have built. I have already not been active at all for about 2 weeks I believe and I just hate this feeling of loosing my strenght  rusting and becoming weaker and weaker.. 

I did watch lots of movies the past week being in another depressive episode again  which I am still in..  and watching some funny videos here and there laughing but I am still being tormented in my insides by everything that has happened to me and the pain I am feeling..
I genuinely don't know if I can keep existing anymore. I have no energy to make new friendships.. I am scared of people.. scared of abuse or being threatened and treated like garbage.

The fact that I also crave love and compassion AND on top of all of that am a fuckin human being is so disgusting to me. I just want to vanish and have never existed in the first place. My birthgiver should have just gotten an abortion and that would've been best for me and probably for her too. I hate the fact that I am saying this but man I am hurt.

Noone wants me or needs me. Makes no difference if I am not here anymore. I do have my uncle (my dads brother) and a good friend of mine but man I ultimately don't give a shit if they suffer if I really decide to kill myself.. this is my life and I can do whatever the fuck I want. Why am I even here?! I just want this knife sticking through my chest to be gone. I can't live with it like this anymore. 

On top of that I can't seem to find a job.. been only getting rejections and my money is running out..
Luckily from tomorrow on I'll partially be in a psych ward... hope this will help but I still feel so lost. I don't know if it'll make a difference. After my 1 to 2 month stay there I will have to have a job and man I just don't think I can do it. If I just were financially secure and had a loving home (instead of a sick toxic place) things would be so much better for me.. 

I hate being an adult.. I just feel like a lost small boy.. no matter how old my body is my spirit will always be a small young boy running wild in his dreams..

Idk Idk Idk...

Idk man.. I am really lost here. Whatever.. 
I am just lost.. forever..

Edit: So it seems that it'll take a little longer until I can go to the psych ward. Hopefully no later than a week but it's also not promised so yeah.. this is not good.

loneliness,I feel lonely… the kind that rooted deeply in my soul …,"I’m not exactly sure why I feel this way  but it’s become a part of me now. I don’t hate it  but sometimes it makes me feel really uncomfortable and  honestly... lonely. It happens when I struggle to connect with people  or when I want to avoid certain people’s energy because I’d hate to absorb it. It’s like when my mom or dad didn’t understand me—they never really did. And sometimes  even I don’t believe I could truly be seen and heard for who I am. That kind of loneliness runs so deep. 

When social stigma is so strong  I’m scared to show my different sides  afraid of how people might react—harshly or badly—or worse  that someone I love might end up feeling ashamed of me. That kind of pain is hard to bear. I go against the norms  and I hope someone out there can relate and remind me I’m not alone in feeling this way.",7,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1hvp38i/i_feel_lonely_the_kind_that_rooted_deeply_in_my/
loneliness,I've been alone for years and I think it's going to kill me,"This is going to be a long post so I'm sorry if it's too much to read but I've got to get this out somewhere.

I'm 22 and I've been alone and without friends for years now and it's eating me from the inside. I've found myself often crying for no reason and my heart aching for something I'm afraid I'll never have. I have no one I can talk to  no one I can vent to or anyone who would care to hear. I've tried to convince myself I'd be okay being alone and that I could learn to ""love myself"" as I've heard being suggested alot but it doesn't work. Humans aren't meant to be this lonely  this isolated. It's killing me. I've tried to do something about it like going out and trying to meet people  that hasn't worked either. I tried to go to a meetup social nearby a few months ago but when I got there everyone was already grouped up with eachother and I didn't want to be the annoying one trying to weasel their way into their already established friend groups. I ended up sitting alone outside for 20 minutes waiting for an uber to pick me up. I was so ashamed and hated myself for it and ended up having a panic attack so bad I had to go to the hospital for fear I was having a heart attack. I know that I should've just tried to talk to someone there but I was so afraid of being rejected or being seen as annoying or invasive that I just froze and... couldn't do it. After years of social isolation I have very little social skills  I can't hold a conversation which leads to awkward silences that I'm deathly afraid of and never know what to say. It doesn't help that I'm not exactly an attractive person to look at. I don't think I'm horrendous but I'm 6'2 302lbs (I used to be 350 before I started my weight loss journey in February). I have essentially 0 self confidence and I'm pretty sure others can sense that pretty easily.

I've also never been in a relationship. I'm a virgin at 22  I've never kissed anyone or even held hands with anyone and it makes me feel so worthless and pathetic. And due to my size I feel like I can't even attempt to change that until I've gotten to a proper  healthy size which I'm working on but it's going to be a long time until I've reached my goal. I don't even care about the sex part anymore really  I just want to be held or to hold someone close so badly that it physically hurts to think about I'm so starved of affection. Just a hug would be heaven at this point.


I feel so empty and hopeless and whilst I know I'm not the only one in the world that feels this way  it truly does feel like it for me. Every where I look I see groups of friends and couples and they all seem so...happy. I find myself bitter and angry at the world even though it's nobody's fault but my own. I see happy friends and couples and I feel hatred towards them  simply because they're happy and I'm not. I don't like feeling like that  it's not their fault I'm like this. 

I don't know what to do but I know I can't go on like this much longer. I don't think I'm suicidal  I'm too much of a coward to do it I think  but there's only so much pain and emptiness a person can take. 

I pray to whatever God's are out there that no one else has to feel like this  it's hell. I'm sorry for such a long post.

I hope you're all doing better than me  even if I'll hate you for it.",27,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1f6848s/ive_been_alone_for_years_and_i_think_its_going_to/
loneliness,I can’t get over the idea that if I choose to kill myself and succeed  I will no longer have to experience anything,"No dms or advice wanted

I just don’t want to experience anything. I don’t want to be happy  but I also don’t really want to be in pain anymore. Every bit of human interaction makes me want to stab my skull or kill myself. And every single little thing makes me feel insecure.

I think it’s important to mention that I have never believed in an afterlife or a God. Maybe for a short period of time  but it was shallow  I only did it because others did  and I felt it was the correct thing to do.

Every single little action I make is because of my chronic loneliness. Loneliness I believe I have felt since being a child. Or at least before my earliest memory can take me.

I just don’t want to live. I just don’t want to experience at all. Life is a tragedy to me. It’s a prison. A prison I don’t want to be in.

When I think of an after life  I think about nothing. But nothing is really hard to imagine. So I imagine more as a never ending blackness.

I have never had a day of true happiness. Sure  there may have been days where I have woken up happy and excited  but then later I would be feeling sick to my stomach at the thought of going to school.",4,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1gn011z/i_cant_get_over_the_idea_that_if_i_choose_to_kill/
loneliness,I want to die ,i usually don’t ask for help but i’m at my lowest it feels like. my grandma and grandpa both raised me and they both died in 2022. I was only 17 when my grandpa died and just turned 18 when my grandma died. i don’t talk to my younger siblings and my older siblings moved away. I was left with my aunt and she was a slob and it was horrible. I ended up moving out and my job has been cutting my hours and it’s just been hard. I was with a girl but it turned out she was with someone else the whole time and ofc she dropped me.  my whole life i have felt like a nobody. i’m just here because my mom had me. My soul feels so dead. I don’t find enjoyment in anything and I’m always mad and closed off. i want to meet new people but they always end up leaving me or treating me horrible. I’m always being replaced like nothing. i’m so useless in the world. I tried doing things to be gentle with myself and love myself but the pain just always takes over. I even got a cat and i almost still feel lonely. he kinda just adds to my stress. I smoke weed vape and smoke carts and it’s the only thing that gets me through the day. I know im addicted to it but it’s the only thing that can make me feel happy. I’m scared for my health because i do it so much. but no one seems to see how im dying inside. All of my friends left me because of how i am but i can’t help it. i mentally been so depressed and it’s so hard to hide it. i just distance myself so i wont be a burden because i know my sadness ruins everyone’s mood. I just hate myself and i wish i could be better. It just feels like every time i try to change im knocked back down and it hurts. i just need someone to be here it’s so hard being alone at 20. it’s almost like no one cares. i want to die ,8,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1f53vwj/i_want_to_die/
loneliness,Thoughts ,"Hello  all. 19M here. Just wanted to  idk  organize my feelings and let it out somewhere. And since I'm here  you can guess why. Generally? I feel depressed and tired of it all. Which also serves to trouble me more that am like this when my life starting off  you know? To reach a point when there's this constant pain in your body  like you have some chest pain that makes it hard to breathe and eat and you know you ain't I'll of any disease. Rather  it's an illness of another kind  that no antibiotic can heal. 
You just go through each day wondering what are you even doing. There's so little you actually care about nowadays  and yet you also have nothing to yrself. Like  you have zero achievements  talent or heck  that one thing that you can say is you defining suit. You're just some barely average guy  with no friends or sort of a support system. You go through failures and personal shortcomings that leave you frustrated and wondering Just what the heck is wrong with you?
Anyways  I've read a bunch of posts here and there and it offers some sort of comfort that you ain't plain retareded or crazy. That there others who share in yout thoughts and feelings when no one around you does.

loneliness,i'm sorry,Hi. So I have never really done this before. And um  I'm just really nervous to talk about it now but I think I'm ready. I have always been alone and it's been really hard for me. To go cope up with everything. My depression is just blocking me out to try and explore new things like participating in social activities.  But I feel like there are groups everywhere  and I can never belong anywhere. For the longest time I used to just live in delusion and used to think that I had friends. But the only person who thought we were friends was me. And it's always been like that. I have never been able to make any friends  mostly because I'm weird  ill admit that. I used to get bullied in school for having low grades and for being ugly (I genuinely am). I never really got good grades but I'm trying. My family especially my father he is very abusive and hits my mom and my brother. Really bad. And I try to stay out of it but I'm also dragged in it sometimes. My bruises are always somehwere on my face and I don't know how to cover it. Whenever my teachers notice the scars they say things like 'you must've done something bad that's why he hits you'. And some don't even bother asking. Since the past 4 years my father and brother live somehwere else  good thing. But the verbal abuse is still on going. No one really cares about me  ever. Even my mother shut me out because she couldn't bear it anymore. My ex long distance best friend is spreading rumours about me with her friends   and honestly she was the only best thing that will ever happen to me. We were really close a few years ago for 6 months and then they shifted someplace else. I always missed her. And I always will. I tried apologising for everything to her but she wouldn't listen and would pretend that everything was fine  I tried to look out for her and support her but she only cares about her other bestie now. Her brother(he is my age). He held out a hand to me for help. And he comforted me  but I think he is tired of me now. I understand that because he has responsibilities. He has priorities. We fell for each other. We really did. We still love each other but I think he is in pain because of me. When his sister found out about us she went ballistic and told on him to his mom  literally everyone. So he's a bit upset about that. And he's a really amazing guy and girls at school have a crush on him  ( including his sister's current best friends which is okay because he told me to not worry about them. But he's being called a playboy  I think his intensions are pure  so it hurt him. I am giving him a break  he needs it. So yea  and my brother was sent to a mental asylum when he was 13? Everyone at school and in my society called me a mad person  and said I would end up just like him  fast forward now  I think so too. He tried to kill himself multiple times. He tried jumping out of the window so many times  he was really hanging himself but thankfully he was saved later. My brother hates me for not letting him go of his hand that day  but he really jumped out. There is just a lot more  and now I feel like killing myself  there is no point in living  but I don't want to let go at the same time. ,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1h2npwi/im_sorry/
loneliness,I Need Help.,"Hi y'all. I'm currently in a bit of a crisis and am coming to Reddit for advice. This post is probably going to be pretty long  so thank you in advance if you decide to read it. Regardless  I'll include a TL;DR at the end. I'm also going to crosspost to multiple subs for max visibility  and because I'm not sure which sub is the most fitting for the kind of help I'm seeking.

I don't know where to start  so I'll just jump right in. I'm alone and I'm lost. I'm 27m  and I live alone with my cat in Texas. I don't have a single friend that I would consider to be a “true"" friend. I have a couple of work acquaintances and a friend who lives in Florida who l've never met  but who I talk to every day. He's extremely emotionally detached but It's nice to be able to vent to him.

My problem is that l'm a serial loner. l've gone through life with friends and relationships coming and going  either due to them leaving or my own sabotaging. In middle school I was extremely socially awkward and was bullied relentlessly. In high school I started to find myself and became very social and found my group  but those friendships withered away soon after graduation. In college my social butterfly habits continued until I became serious with a girl who l'll call Ex 1. I dated her for 2.5 years and slowly stopped talking to all of my other friends because I was so focused on her. She was my best friend  and to this day is the ""bestest"" friend I've ever had. However  our relationship was super toxic (partially due to my mental health issues and also due to me being constantly unsure if she was ""the one"") and eventually we broke up in 2019  when I was 21. After we broke up I fell into an extremely dark depression that l've never really recovered from. I've made some friends since then (a group of neighbors that moved into the apartment next to mine  a motorcycle club that I formed  etc) but those friendships were always shallow and ended up dissolving for one reason or another. In 2020 I shot myself in the torso (not a suicide attempt  I was just incredibly depressed and delusional). In 2021 | got into a motorcycle accident that almost killed me and left severe  ugly scars all over my head. From October 2021 until September 2023 | worked as a mentor for young adults with severe mental health issues (ironic  I know). I quit that job (a very unethical and shady company) shortly before it went out of business  and now I work as an Amazon driver.

Which brings me to my current state of affairs. Since 2021  most people l've met have been through Yik Yak  a message board type app marketed towards college students. I met a girl there in February  who I'll call Ex 2. Over the next few months we became super close  and soon I was putting all of my time and value into her. I was beginning to think she was my future wife. That relationship is a story in itself  but in short  in July she moved back in with her parents  6 hours away from me. She downloaded Tinder and met a girl who quickly became my replacement. Things got ugly and we broke up about a month ago. Last week she told me she never really loved me and never wants to talk to me again  and I'm absolutely fucking devastated.

So now here I am. Another failed relationship and back to being completely alone. I'm in so much pain about this breakup  why she left me  wondering if our love was real  etc. but it's also making me realize that I myself am entirely too broken. I've always had severe OCD and EXTREME social anxiety. I've been depressed since 2019. Those are issues which I just began to address (I saw a psychiatrist for the first time on Thursday  who prescribed me Prozac  and I just enrolled myself in my job's health insurance plan  which I plan on using to have neuropsychological testing done and find a therapist)  but I'm scared that won't be enough.

The reason I'm coming here for help is that I'm trying to find insight on the issues of loneliness  relationships  friendship and love. I'm just confused about it all. Specifically  I'm struggling with the idea of needing to love myself and fix my own issues before being able to make lasting connections with people. I know logically that that's what I need to do  but I feel too alone to begin the process. What's the point in finding love and happiness within myself if I can't find it within anybody else? I'm just stuck and I don't know what to do. Sometimes I have moments of energy and hope  where I tell myself that I just need to heal myself and then I'll find love  but then when it comes time to actually start that process  I feel paralyzed. I remember how Ex 2 moved away and threw our whole relationship away and fell in love with someone else (they're planning on having a baby via a fertility clinic) like it was nothing. I remember that I'm alone. I don't want to do this alone. I will say that both of my parents are in my life and they are a blessing; the only people I have. But they don't struggle with the issues I have and they don't understand. I just want to be the confident social butterfly that I was in 7-8 years ago  but I don't know how. And I'm so scared that getting too old. Everybody my age is getting married and has the friends that they'll likely keep for the rest of their lives. How do I overcome this? Most importantly  what is the true meaning of companionship and how should I go about finding it?

Thanks again to those that decided to read that heap of word salad. Any advice or insight would be much appreciated.

TL;DR: I don't know how to make lasting connections with people. I don't know how to find friends that I value  or find healthy love. I need to reframe my mind but I don't know where to start.",4,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1g98giy/i_need_help/
loneliness,I'm not your average depressed lonely person. I don't understand why I'm lonely and nobody cares about me,"I'm an average build guy  goes often to the gym  plays in a band  rides skateboard  goes out constantly to rock shows   I'm knowledgeable in various topics  I even give myself a 8/10  I use perfumes  my hygiene is intact  I feel like I'm an attractive person  I love myself  I feel like the big shit  but very few people approach me and if I start a convo  the convo ends very fast. All my friends moved from town and I lost a lot of connections. Even the last girl that I dated told me the same thing ""Why you feel like that? You are super beautiful and interesting everything to make a woman go crazy and stuff to easily make friends.""  I'm a very spiritual and superstitious person and I feel like there's a wall in my life and unless I do something  like in a video game  the path won't open for me. I still don't know how to destroy that wall.

loneliness,I don’t know what I’m doing wrong,"I feel like I’m destined to be alone. It doesn’t matter how hard I try  no one sticks around. I have no one in my life- no one to talk to  no one to laugh with. My phone is so dry  I don’t know why I bother having one. I don’t know what’s so awful about me that means that nobody wants to even be associated with me. 

I’m aware that if you look at my profile and the posts that are on there  I come across as an unhappy and miserable person  but I’m not always like that. I use Reddit to try and express my emotions in a healthy way because I have no one to talk to. When I’m having general conversations with people  I’m much more upbeat. I try my best to take an interest and ask questions to keep the conversation going. I’m always polite  and especially when messaging someone  I’m never pushy about getting a reply. I try to treat the person I’m talking to the way I wish someone would treat me. 

I can’t seem to even keep internet friends. I met someone on this subreddit and we started talking when they sent me a message after seeing one of my posts. We instantly hit it off and really related to one another. I finally felt understood by someone. We talked for almost a year  then suddenly  they stopped talking to me. I hadn’t said anything that was rude or upsetting- we were just in the middle of a conversation. I tried contacting them on Reddit  discord  even their phone number they had given me  but it’s as if they’d vanished. I understand that people have things going on in their lives  but I thought they cared enough about me to have at least said something  even if it was that they didn’t want to be friends anymore. 

There was someone else who I met online that I also seemed to click with. Again  I spent hours talking to them  and really put the effort in  only for them to stop replying a couple of months back. I just wish people wouldn’t get my hopes up. They even said how much they were looking forward to getting to know me better  and that they enjoyed talking to me. I don’t like when people say things like that when they clearly don’t mean it  because it really messes with my head. I know I have to keep putting myself out there to give myself a fighting chance to meet new people  but there’s only so much I can take. The whole process is draining. I don’t want to miss an opportunity due to past experiences not being great  but I don’t want to spend so much time on someone again if they’re just going to ghost me. 

I feel so unwanted and insignificant. I just want to be important to someone  to be wanted  for someone to care so much that they would miss me if I wasn’t around. If I disappeared right now  no one would probably notice  let alone be bothered. I have so much love and time to give to someone  but no one wants anything to do with me. Every night I go to bed wishing that one day I might find somebody else who feels the same. ",9,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1joc72n/i_dont_know_what_im_doing_wrong/
loneliness,Does anyone feel like this specific feeling of loenliness? What feeling is this and why does it happen?,"Im going to start by saying I looked at multiple subreddits and this one seems like the better one for me to post this in. It could also work into different subreddits  but this one seems the most fitting. Ive only shared this briefly with my parents and a bit more in depth with my therapist  so its a bit weird to figure out how to put it into words.

So im just going to say it: I feel like im missing someone thats supposed to be here  but isnt. Its not a certain person that has a name or face  its not someone I\`ve met. The best way to explain it is  and i\`m sorry if this sounds a bit nerdy or something  like someone was actually here  but they got erased somehow and everyone\`s memories of them were erased as well.  However  I can still feel them  but not strongly enough to see their face or actually remember who they were. (What i feel is important to point out is that i **know** that didnt happen  nobody got magically wiped out  its just a sensation that I\`m trying to understand\*\*)\*\*.

As if(and this is the part that sounds nerdy)  they live in a parallel universe. I like to think of parallel universes not as actual parallel strings  but as a big lump of strings  all mixed in together  still separate though. And sometimes there are places in which the strings are closer to one another and you can hear/feel something from the other universe. Similar to that  it almost feels like the veil between two realities is thinner in some places and what i feel is an echo of what is happening in the parallel universe. (bear with me) Again   I don't actually belive that's what's happening  it's just a comparison  because I'm trying to put into words.

Throught the ages of 9/10 - 14  I've sometimes had pretty real dreams in which I was with someone and I could feel this comforting  warm  calms-your-nervous-system kind of peace. Those people felt real and there was a sense of safety when I was with them. I would wake up and miss them.

Then  when I was 14  a pretty weird thing happened. It's the first time I've felt this sensation and it's also the strongest way I've experienced it. I was at school  we had to go outside. Slowly but surely  I started feeling like someone is missing. I was sitting with all of my friends  but still I felt this strong feeling (im so sorry for how much im gonna say this word) like there was an actual person  name  face  personality  that wasn't here. I looked at all my classmates  it was so real I felt the need to count everyone. Sure enough  everyone was there. It was pretty weird  like you miss someone  but you don't know who.

Later that day  or the following day  at dinner  with my parents and brother  I had the same feeling: someone is also supposed to literally sit down with us at the table and they aren't here  like they were taken from us. It's a bittersweet  mostly sad but also a bit agitating eerie sense of longing.

Like a month ago (I'm now 17)  I was on Pinterest and i saw this pretty  aesthetic clip of two girls running on a field. For the first time in a long time  i started feeling the whole missing thing again(more soothing though) and i remember thinking: ""I miss her""  except idk who it is and the memories that never happened are very foggy.

A few weeks ago  I was going to school. On the radio  there was a song that had a piano segment very similar to Je te laisserai des mots. Like 10 minutes after  the golden morning rays of sunshine shined in such a pretty way and the birds were chirping. It looked like a cinematic shot of a comforting movie or like a scene from a Life is Strange montage (iykyk).  When I was inside of the school  someone was playing this beautiful song on a piano (our school has a piano that we can play when/if we want during break time). Then for a couple moments  as i was listening to the second piano song that morning  there was that feeling again  this time less of an ""where is this person  i need to find them in here""  and more of a warm  nostalgic sensation. I could almost see a face  I remembered this girl that was in my dreams years ago and she was my adoptive sister. It felt like **she is supposed to be here(** going to school  talking to me  laughing and just doing basic everyday things together) and i just missed her so much. Like everything was slightly off and **emptier**  without her. As if we are locked in separate rooms and I can hear her through the wall  except I don't know where the door is and I don't know to get to her. All in all  the feeling was a bit sad  but mostly comforting(!).

I've been a bit lonely these past few months  or even years(very grateful for my parents  especially my dad  because they're here for me and i don't know how much lonelier i would've been without them). So I thought it's just my minds way of coping  that's why I'm posting it in the loneliness subreddit.

I'm open to more interpretations spiritual of this.

My therapist suggested I talk to my mom  and see if I have/had a twin or something.

Thank you so much for reading all of this and hopefully not thinking I'm crazy :)

Is it just a way of coping with loneliness? Have you guys ever felt like this? How would you interpret it and what could it be? Any advice on what to do/where else should i post this?",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1jgql9c/does_anyone_feel_like_this_specific_feeling_of/
loneliness,I’ve lost my spark and I feel like I’m spiralling,"
Ever since I lost my auntie  I’ve been spiralling. On the outside  I look like I’m coping pretty well  but internally  I’m screaming. I know they say it gets worse before it gets better  but I feel like everything is falling apart.

I’m 24 years old and I feel like I’ve got nothing left to live for. I have no job  no friends  no relationship  nobody in my life who has a positive impact upon it. Everything is such a mess  and I don’t know how I’m supposed to get myself out of this  or if I even want to. 

My auntie was the only person in my life who cared about me. She was my one source of support and stability in the world. I miss having someone to talk to  someone to have a laugh with  someone who was always there if I needed a hug. It felt like we were a team as we’d always help each other in any way we could. Now  I feel all alone in the world and I’ve never felt so isolated. I don’t know if I can keep going without her. Everything seems like a chore and I don’t find joy in anything. When I’m in a more rational state of mind  I know what I’m about to say is stupid  but it’s definitely a recurring thought. I honestly wish I would’ve gone when she did. I know I’m young and have my life ahead of me  but I’ve got nothing and no one left. There’s not been one day since she died that I’ve actually been glad I woke up.

I’m currently sat at the beach on a really nice sunny afternoon. Everyone around me is enjoying their time outside with someone else. I’m sat alone on a bench looking on from the sidelines. 

I don’t have anyone in my life anymore and it’s so lonely. I’ve always felt alone to a degree  but never on this scale. Now with grief added on top  I feel like I’m not really a part of society anymore. I’m existing  not living. I’ve tried to find people who could maybe relate to me  but it’s come to nothing. I don’t get my hopes up anymore when I see someone that seems to be in a similar situation to me. Everyone either ignores me or just says ‘I’m sorry’ or ‘good luck’ and moves on. I can appreciate from my post that I don’t sound like a very fun person to be around  but I am much more cheerful when I’m talking to people. I just feel like I have to make posts like this to find people who might feel the same and understand. I have no patience anymore for surface level interactions  but talking about deep things freaks a lot of people out. I know you have to build up a level of trust to have those conversations  and I’d happily take the time and effort to get to know someone. It’s just finding someone that I connect with in the first place. I have so much love and kindness to give  but I’ve never had anyone even give me a chance. I just want to matter to someone. That hope of eventually finding someone is the only thing keeping me alive right now.

I don’t really have anything to talk about with people I’m surrounded by irl. Nobody wants to talk about heavier topics like grief  which I can understand  but it’s hard when you feel you have no one to turn to. It’s pretty much consuming my life at the moment  so it would be nice to have somebody if I needed them. Apart from the grief  I have nothing going on in my life right now  except for feeling miserable. That means I’m either forgotten in a group conversation or I have people projecting all their personal life on me. I find that when people are telling me about their lives  I’m just nodding and not taking in anything they’re saying. I never would’ve been like that before  and I never used to zone out of conversations completely. I’ve not genuinely laughed or smiled since my auntie died- it’s all fake smiles and pleasantries from me. I’m glad other people are happy and have things going on in their lives  but everything seems so superficial and pointless to me. I’m my own worst enemy  because I’m so lonely  yet when I’m in other people’s company  I’m just waiting until I can leave. No one who I converse with is anything like me. It’s the classic lonely in a room full of people feeling.

The thing that scares me is that I don’t seem to care anymore. Sure  I’ve had days in the past where I’ve been in a bad mood and not wanted to do anything  but this is another level. For example  in the past I would’ve been really stressed about having no job and therefore no income  but now  even though I know my savings will run out eventually  I’m not making an effort to do anything about it. I know how I can solve some issues in my life  and I’m not proud of my attitude towards certain things  but I can’t push myself to do anything. I’m the most depressed I’ve ever been. Deep down  I know I want to get better  but I don’t see the point in trying to make a life for myself if I’m always going to feel so out of place and isolated. 

Nothing I seem to do makes me feel any better  and if it does  it’s a temporary fix. I can be having a half decent day  but the minute I’m left alone with my thoughts  I feel awful and often break down crying. This might sound strange  but one of the things that made me realise how bad things have got is me losing my love for music. I’ve loved music for as long as I can remember and it was what I always gravitated towards if I was struggling. I’ve gone from listening to songs everyday for hours  to having several days where I don’t listen to a thing. It also used to be a great distraction  but anytime I listen music now  my thoughts overpower it and I can’t focus on any part of the song. I was on the train a few days ago  and I used to love listening to music whilst watching the world go by  but I can’t even enjoy that anymore. I nearly ended up crying on the train  and it’s not the first time that’s happened. I think because I know it isn’t going to solve anything in the long run  I can’t seem to justify spending time listening to it. My thought processes have really been messed up.

I’m trying my best to look after myself and push forward  because I know that what’s my auntie would’ve wanted. I know eventually I’ll be grateful to my past self for pushing through this. I try my best to go out and have some new experiences  but most of the time  I don’t end up feeling any better. I find myself getting stressed out by other people’s actions  and if anywhere is crowded  I just want to run away. I’m happy doing some things alone  but when it’s all the time  nothing seems fun. I just find it hard when there seems to be no purpose for anything anymore. Every night I lie in bed and question whether this is all that life has to offer me. If so  I’d quite happily fall asleep and never wake back up. 

I needed to get all this misery out somewhere as I have no one to discuss it with. I do usually feel better for a while when I post something like this  but all the heaviness will come back eventually. I feel like it’s never going to leave me and I’ll always have this dull ache in my chest. 

I’m honestly scared where this is all going to end. I’m fighting the urge to hide away and shut myself in completely. I know I’m probably not the best person to be around at the moment  but I need someone. I’m not saying this to big myself up  but I’ve always been the one to help others  put their feelings and needs before mine. I’m sick of hearing so many people online saying you need to work on yourself before getting involved with others  romantically or platonically. There’s times in life when we’re all at our worst and need a bit of help and support from somebody. I’m not greedy  I just need one person who I click with  who gets me. I just wish someone would come and save me for once.",7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1ji1poz/ive_lost_my_spark_and_i_feel_like_im_spiralling/

loneliness,A stream of consciousness about loneliness,"So  I'll post here only because I don't want to stay in my head. I haven't gotten many responses in my posts so far  and I don't expect this time will be any different. But I just want to let it out.

I've felt lonely all my life  even at school  even when I had friends I frequently spent time with. Sometimes  for a while  I'd feel like I belonged  but mostly I'd be proven wrong soon later.

In November  my relationship ended. Honestly  the last few months it was obvious. We barely talked and saw each other. But I guess I wanted to believe there was a way to fix it. He didn't. I finally let him go. And that ending was similar to my prior relationships. 

I developed a bond with my family only too late. I am 27 now. Two years ago they had to move away  and I wish that happened organically instead of being forced by the home owner. I had to stay in the city due to my studies. Now I got a good job and friends here  but going to an empty home and having no one to talk about minor daily stuff hits hard suddenly.

I have dealt with depression  CPTSD  anxiety and panic attacks as a result of PTSD all my life. I was suicidal for a few years between the ages of 19-22. I'm not anymore. I've dedicated myself to teaching and learning - growth all the way. Some days I am proud of myself for how far I've come  but the deep talks at the end of a tiring and eventful day are where I feel a sense of belonging  and sometimes I have that with someone for a while  then it slips. 

I would love to stick around for someone through thick and thin  and I've got some friendships like that. But when everybody's busy with their own thing  me included  I understand the importance of a romantic relationship  a home to come to  much deeper. I feel like nobody will stick around for me like that.

I hold onto things so strongly. I knew I would be a teacher when I was a kid. I knew I wanted to live abroad for a while and I did. I knew I wanted a place of my own where I can build a small library and a nice study room  and although it's not a pinterest picture  I have it now. I know I hold onto people who hold onto me.

This is it. A lot of vagueness and a little disorganized  but as I said  I just wanted to get it off of my chest. ",3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1i0d80k/a_stream_of_consciousness_about_loneliness/
loneliness,Loneliness? Peace?,"I recently moved to a new city and settled in a new apartment  it was my dream to live alone and peacefully. But here I am after 5 months in utter peace  alone and I constantly ask myself: am I experiencing peace or loneliness? I sometimes realize ""I'm alone and lonely"" and I always try to distract myself whether its games studying or something else. If I sit down and just think I get overwhelmed with the thoughts of being alone and having nobody to share my thoughts and stuff with. It does get miserable  and I really want to have somebody on my side in those moments.

I don't understand I wanted to be alone in peace  yet I crave human interaction within my home. Did I overestimate myself and thought I could handle it? I don't know. It feels weird like this - I don't know what to do and yeah  I do go outside hang with friend's  attend classes in university but it doesn't matter.

I wouldn't say that it's destroying my life  but it definitely got me asking myself some questions that could turn into deep loneliness.",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1ill3ec/loneliness_peace/
loneliness,My auntie died last week and I’ve never felt more alone,"My auntie died last Wednesday and it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever had to deal with. She was 91 and I’m 24. I’m not naive- I knew with her age that at some point in the near future she wouldn’t be here anymore. It just all happened so fast and I can’t believe she’s really gone. 

Despite the difference in our ages  she was my best friend. I lived with her  and every single day we would have a laugh about something. We confided in each other about anything we needed to and knew we could trust each other. I could tell her anything  whether that was something silly that had happened at work or whether I needed advice on something more serious. 

I’ve always been a bit of a loner and I’ve found it hard to form connections with people. I struggle to articulate what I want to say sometimes  but that means I often come across in a way I don’t mean to. Because of this  I don’t have a big circle. I had come to accept the fact that I was always going to be lonely. I only began speaking to my auntie regularly about 3 years ago  due to her being a distant relative. We hit it off instantly  and she actually took the time to listen to me  which I’d never had in the past. Moving in with her is the best decision I ever made. Before this  I had learnt to be pretty self sufficient  even though I was living with my parents  and I always kept things to myself. I was pretty depressed and tried to escape my reality all the time through music  books  and video games. It felt like a new beginning with her where I was finally able to be myself. My auntie never shut me down or made passive aggressive comments. She always took the time to talk to me and try to understand where I was coming from. For someone who had never had that before  it had a massive impact. 

Now I feel like I’m back to three years ago before I started talking to her. I am absolutely miserable. Nothing I do helps. I wake up  after barely sleeping  and end up in tears before I’ve even left my bed. My appetite has gone  and when I try to eat  I just feel queasy. I’ve found myself crying and getting frustrated at any random thing. I’ve been working  as I don’t earn anything if I’m not there  and I thought it would help  but it isn’t. I work in retail  where I end up pacing the shop floor a lot  and that’s just fuelling my mind to keep thinking about the situation. Although I know I should keep busy at home  I don’t feel like doing anything  or if I try  I just end up in tears. 

Nobody really cares about me- only she truly did. Although I’m not particularly close with any of them  only one person out of about 15 people at work has said I’m sorry for your loss. I know they all know though  as they keep looking at me when they think I’m not looking. I appreciate it’s difficult to know what to say  but you could at least say I’m sorry. I know the world doesn’t revolve around me  but they’re all just carrying on talking to me about random trivial things as if nothing has happened to me. My immediate family aren’t the nicest of people. I get on well with my Dad  but the rest of them act like they care in order to get something from me  or try to control what I do. My auntie’s son and his wife have been really good with me  and they let me stay for a few days after she’d died. I didn’t want to overstay my welcome though  and they have each other. I only have one friend who I don’t see that often. In my eyes  my auntie was my family  and now she’s gone. I’d never experienced real family love off anyone before I met my auntie  and now that’s gone too. I feel like I was walking around alone in the world  she came into my life  and I had 3 years where I finally found my place  only for it to all be stripped away  and now I’m alone again. I’m scared I’m never going to find love again  in every sense of the word. I know with my auntie it was because there was such a big age difference  but I’m also scared that if I do find love  I’m going to go through this cycle in life of me loving someone  only for them to be taken away from me. 

The past couple of nights I’ve been back home. It’s been really hard. I try to make it as positive as possible and keep myself occupied. The first night I got myself a pizza and put a film on  but I only ate about two slices before my appetite went  and I couldn’t concentrate on the film. I then just cried for several hours until I finally fell asleep. I knew I had to come back eventually  but I’m dreading coming in from work every night now. The house is so silent and I’m surrounded by all these memories. The hardest part is when I first come in from work  as she always used to greet me and ask about my day. I hate coming home to an empty house. 

I honestly don’t know what to do. I know the feeling will pass  but at the minute  I really don’t want to be here anymore. My life outside of living with my auntie was not really the life I wanted for myself  and it often got me down. Being able to live with her and have her to cheer me up spurred me on to try and change things. Now the one good thing is gone  I don’t even want to try  because everything just seems crap. I’ve got no one and nothing now. I’m already finding it hard having no one to talk to  but having to put on a brave face every day for work is making it harder. There’s nothing good to get up for in the morning. I know before she was ill  she always told me she wanted me to be happy. That is the only thing at the moment that has stopped me from doing something stupid  as I know she would’ve been horrified if I did. I do want to be happy  it just seems unobtainable for so many different reasons.

I’m certainly starting to understand the phrase ‘it’s better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all’. I’m so so grateful for every moment I had with her and I know now what real love is. I just want her back. 

I’m not looking for sympathy from people with this post  I just needed to get this out of my head. Thanks for taking the time to read this if you got this far.",4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1gubt45/my_auntie_died_last_week_and_ive_never_felt_more/
loneliness,Rant on personal life. SEEKING ADVISE!,"So for background.. I’m 23 years old… 6ft4” tall and pretty smart… according to some peers. 

For the last couple of years ever since college ended  I’m at a factory(family business unit) far away from home. I stay in a guesthouse within the factory premises as the factory is practically in the middle of a windmill farm spread over thousands of hectares. I’ve been doing quite well there and I look after the entire business. The business has infact improved after I’m in charge there. I really enjoy every bit of it bcoz the whole concept of a business just excites me. I love it from start to end  all the hurdles.. the gains.. everything!. My only issue is I’m lonely AF! 

Most of my day is spent wondering what it would be like if there was someone waiting for me when I went back to my room after the heavy day of work. If there were someone who can ask me how was my day  did I have my lunch  maybe just give me a hug… idk! The reality is there is no one for me around and it hurts. It just sucks to be so lonely. I see people around me all in the company of others so happy and here I am just wondering how great it would be to have people around who not just cared about you  but you could also care about. I’m all alone and nobody the fuck is interested to know or help.  
The only thing that takes things off my mind easily is driving. And when I drive around for hours and arrive somewhere  all I see is happy friends who’re visiting somewhere together or couples holding hands. I’m the only sick dick visiting a movie theatre alone  a restaurant alone  a beach alone  a bar alone(in extreme cases of loneliness attacks  I just drive to bars)  even a new destination alone. I try to travel a lot recently just to help myself feel better and later I find myself tellling people how much I love solo travelling. I don’t love it. I just don’t want them to know that there’s nobody actually willing to go anywhere with me. Even though we’re not super rich and stuff  I still have enough to pay for all the expenses of anyone travelling with me. Even then I’m not even a random thought once in a year in any of the people who i know. 
I have had friends in college and a group of few friends which became quite close towards the end of college. Now they’ve all moved onto new offices or other colleges for further studies and they’ve all found their new friend groups. Yes we do have meet-ups very rarely but most of the time I’m not invited and even if I go I just sit there like a non existent void that doesn’t have the need for any fulfilment. 

I’m also big on spirituality and I’m always told that happiness comes from within and not from outside. It’s not another person who can give you happiness. It should be your state of mind irrespective of your surroundings. I understand all of that and I’ll try my best to be happy alone. But why is the universe hell bent on teaching me that lesson cruelly and consistently while it has blessed everyone else’s life with people around. Why am I the subject of this experiment to check when a man can break into the most minute particles from constant loneliness up to point of failure. 

I’ve also had relationships before. Three of them. The first one was someone I’d respected and cared for as much as my mother. I was devoted as hell to her. Welll she got married to someone else and is now pregnant. I’m happy for her. She got the life she wanted. Her happiness is my happiness. My second relationship was just a relationship that ended when both of us gradually found out we were totally different. Our conversations gradually died down and we both acknowledged amicably that it was not meant to be as it wasn’t interesting to both of us. The third one was devastating and something I’d put all my heart into. I started ignoring everybody I knew just to focus on one woman. I was told love is all about giving and not receiving. I gave everything I had to her. My time  attention  the key to my well being  everything. One fine day she found out my caste is different(technically my caste is higher than hers  but she wants same caste; thanks society😌) and then just decided to be like I didn’t exist at all. Ignored me and avoided me for 6 months straight until I turned into a depressed monster who still doesn’t know what even is the reason for this. Wanted to kill myself every single minute of every day for a year after that. Just didn’t kill myself bcoz I knew it would hurt my parents. I had vowed to kill myself the day both my parents leave their bodies. Cuz that is my last string I’ve to hold onto in this material world. Eveything else is a fucking lie. 
Nobody wants me. Nobody likes me. I’m just a mistake who for some reason the universe decided to deny all pleasures of human company. ",5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1ghwv5k/rant_on_personal_life_seeking_advise/
loneliness,i just had an epiphany. i think ive learned where my loneliness stems from,"i was chatting in a discord server about loneliness  about how i dont have many friends  about how loneliness has affected me  how nearly everyone in my life betrayed me messed me up as a person  making me even more closed off and resentful to people because of the fear of being hurt again....but i realized something during that conversation. 

i think my feelings of isolation  the feeling of never fitting in  the feelings of wanting another person to share my days with so badly...stems from childhood trauma. let me explain

there are some parents out there that dont deserve kids  my mother being one of them. she would often beat me when i made mistakes  withhold food from me  yell and scream at me...so on and so forth. typical abusive parent shit yknow
i hate to think about it as i write this. the way none of my teachers caught on that something wasnt right at home. those people failed me so bad. i was too young to understand i was being abused...so all i had were the adults that never noticed to help me. all the time i think about how the outcome couldve been so different if i was just given more eyes. if somebody noticed my behavioral problems and just thought...""how are things at home?""

but thats not what this post is about. im getting off topic my bad LMAO
as you would imagine with an abusive parent  neglect comes into play  too. getting screamed at was more common than an ""i love you"" or a hug/a kiss from my mother. or i would show my mom something i made   and she doesnt even look at me or my creation. just gives me a monotone ""cool"" and continues what shes doing

i feel like my loneliness comes from never being loved as a kid. never being given the time of the day. never having the attention i was supposed to get at that age. i think  as a result of being deprived from these things as a child  it manifested into loneliness and isolation as i got older. i was stripped from these things when i was little  and now that im older  i seek the things i never had as a child in other people. i desire the close connection i never had with my mom. i desire the love and attention i never received. so on and so forth 

and i think that explains why i tend to fall so hard for people. why i care so much and never receive that anything in return. loving the people that don't give you as much as a second glance so deeply. i think  as a result of being neglected emotionally by my mother  i give all the things i never had to other people. i give them my undivided attention. i give them a shoulder to cry on. i give them the love i never had. i never understood why i do this for so long until tonight. and holy shit i had to stop and sob for a little bit before going back to writing. the pain of nobody ever seeing what i was enduring as a child was killing me i had to cry about it

i always knew childhood trauma and parental abuse can mess a person up  but...i dont think i ever understood how severe it can be until now. i don't think i truly grasped the weight of it all until now. i never realized how badly the abuse i endured with my mother ruined me. i never got it until now. and it baffles me when i put the pieces together like this after a decade of carrying these traumatic memories on my shoulders. am i DUMB for taking so long to realize it? i mean  i know now is better than never but still  yknow?

it might even explain why i hate being ignored. i fucking hate when i talk and nobody even acknowledges im around. theres nothing that makes me angrier than that. and regretfully i have the ugliest temper out there  but only specific things trigger it at least  so its not like im a ticking time bomb  fortunately 
but yeah. probably being ignored so much as a child resulted in hating it so much when i get ignored now. golly  man.

but i feel better knowing the answers now. i feel better when i have answers about why i do what i do. why i am the way i am. it makes immense sense....and it all simmers down to when i was little. life is crazy
my brain feels clean. my brain feels lighter in my head now that i finally have some answers. my loneliness has been eating me alive and i can barely get out of bed anymore because of it  but...my days might be at least a little better now than i have an understanding about my loneliness and where it comes from

i might also post this on other subreddits because id like to share this information with others. or i might not because im a little afraid of people potentially being mean in the comments. we'll see",7,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1fr9o1t/i_just_had_an_epiphany_i_think_ive_learned_where/
loneliness,Just feel like a burden,I'm normally a quiet person  but when people come to me  I tend to give an empathetic ear and they love coming to me because of that . Sometimes they get close n they want to also help yet they don't know as I'm helping them fix their pieces   I'm a fuckin mess. I rarely tell people about my frustrations because I know it's overwhelming to put that on a person   it's just that recent I made two close friends I'd actually open up to  they'd come to me n open up and I help them. I guess they started feeling like they needed to reciprocate so they started asking about me  I opened up about my struggles n suddenly they started acting colder towards me after a while  they'd ignore any deep conversations with me. They are less available than they used to be. It just hurts because I finally thought I found people that would understand me but seems I'm too broken for them and I overwhelmed then by telling them the truth about my actual wellbeing.  I feel so lost and lonely  it hurts  I was okay being alone n now I'm exposed n attached   I really wish they didn't try getting close to me if they were just going to get burdened by what I go through . I don't know  how am I supposed to apologise for  being a mess and not okay,5,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1g3cvy3/just_feel_like_a_burden/
loneliness,I’m dead inside,I’m 17 about to graduate high school. Ik where I’m going to college  but none of my top degree choices are perfect for me. I don’t have a best friend. Only ever had 1 gf  and it only lasted a month. I try to talk to people and I can tell they are annoyed by my talking. I feel like a burden to people. No one talks to me unless I do first. I don’t feel wanted or loved. Except by my family ofc. But that’s not enough. I would be contempt  if I had a bsf or a gf  but I don’t have either. I’m going to skip my senior prom because it’s not worth going to it. I’m desperately hoping that college changes things and I find people. I’ve always been alone. It’s not like I haven’t tried. I’m nice kind and respectful. I listen to people if they have problems. I do everything I can to make friends  but it doesn’t work and idk what the problem is or what to do anymore.

loneliness,26 Years of Unspoken Words,"After 26 years  I finally discovered this app  thanks to a friend.  It feels like a breath of fresh air  a place where I can open my mind  express myself freely  and truly be heard.  For so long  I held back my feelings  sharing only bits and pieces  but it always seemed like people didn't want to hear what I had to say.  It hurt  deeply and inexplicably. I often wondered why I felt so unseen.

So  here I am  wondering if this is the space where I can finally express myself without judgment.  I've reached a point where I feel like no one listens anyway  and honestly  that feels strangely liberating.  It's like now is the perfect time to just let it all out.

Maybe you'll think I'm being dramatic.  If so  that's okay.  I've been told that before.  But the truth is  I chose this app precisely because I don't need to ask for anyone's attention. I can just be myself  with all my messy emotions and thoughts  and share what's on my heart without feeling like a burden.",6,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1itjljv/26_years_of_unspoken_words/

loneliness,Today has been horrible,I'm a 20 y/o guy from Germany and I just can't get my head of my loneliness lately. It's not that I got nobody to talk to  rather that I feel like I'd just be a burden or bother some people too much. I can't stop thinking about friendships  relationships or just going out in general. Everytime I hear my older brother and his friends say how much fun they were having at my age and I'm just working  going to school and gaming. I want to change  but I don't even know where to start. I thought of going to therapy again  yet ever therapist I met so far either wasn't the right fit or my insurance wouldn't cover it and as a student I can't really afford it otherwise.

loneliness,32 m  going through a hard time again in life. Depressed  lonely  feel empty. Just need someone to talk to.,"I’m 32  going through a rough time yet again. Living with my ex but separately in the same house. For the time being at least. We had been together for about 3.5 years. Living together a majority of that.   She was my best friend  but now I don’t have that anymore. We were together almost every day  I have friends  but I guess we have become distant due to the nature of my relationship.. it’s hard to reach out to anyone. Even my family  I hate the feeling of being a burden. Everyone has their own life and problems  lately I just have been so down  depressed  empty. Drinking to forget about shit.

Somehow I always manage to ruin the good things I have… honestly it’s just fucking hard. Sometimes I just sit for hours doing absolutely nothing. Some days I feel good enough to get out and do something. I spiral a lot at night. Because it’s the quietest and when I feel most alone.  I don’t even necessarily need to talk about my problems. Just someone to talk to  it’s hard when you just feel like you need someone but there is no one.

If anyone feels the same or just wants to talk about life or anything I’d appreciate that. All good if not. Thought I would try. Thanks for reading ",10,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1f7qsbz/32_m_going_through_a_hard_time_again_in_life/
loneliness,I geniunely do not understand why people push me away when I just want to be geniune with myself and with others.,"I suffered from loneliness on and off for a couple of years now.

  
I do indeed have a small mixture of friends who I can open up to and feel that I can trust.

  
However  I admit that I am sometimes afraid to open up completely because people push me away when I try to do that.

  
Now  I am very well aware of the danger of loneliness - it is a paradox because you feel lonely but somehow powerless and think you cannot get out of it.

It is similar to depression because it is a self-perpetuating cycle and if you feel so desperate to have human connection  others may not be well-equipped to handle you and might believe that you are a burden.

  
At least  that is what my mind thinks because I have been trying to learn over and over and over how I can approach people in the correct manner without risking being alienated.

This is possibly due to the fact that I have been pushed away for so many reasons - bullying when I was a teenager  parental neglect  and sometimes  whenever I open up to someone about my mental health whenever I feel that it is time to do it because as much as I have learned that there is an approach to this  I honestly aim to be genuine and not sound like a child or a burden.

Heck  I even got rejected when I told people that I am a university student (long story short  I had to change careers for health reasons) and I still do not understand why.

Not only that but I have honestly felt like my social skills have been very lacking because of social contact or the onset of my mental health getting the worst out of me so I had to learn slowly what to say or not to say and put myself at a constant risk of being accepted or rejected.

Additionally  I feel like I have a certain label on my head because of my mental health struggles  ranging from depression  anxiety  PTSD  and remnants of an eating disorder that I had when I was around 17 years old  recently I was diagnosed with Level 1 autism spectrum disorder (which may or not explain why I sometimes lack certain social cues)



So if I have to eventually open up about anything about myself to someone  so how come that person suddenly pushes me away when I thought that we genuinely had a decent connection?



Again  I feel that I have been rejected for all sorts of reasons  some of them are what I consider to be stupid.

Why do people feel afraid if I tell a stranger a casual ""hello"" or whenever I think that it is the right term to tell someone the following words ""Listen  I need to tell you something ...""?



I would never do that to anyone so why aren't people being reciprocal

loneliness,Hello there,"I'm a 29-year-old woman  and while I'm extremely extroverted  I don't really have anyone close that I can open up to about more personal topics. Sure  I have people I can engage in small talk with  but it doesn't go any deeper than that.

I used to be the 'therapist' friend  always there to listen without judgment  never minimizing anyone's problems. But when I try to open up  it feels like my struggles are brushed aside  like they don't really matter. I do understand that listening to someone going through something can be a burden for people who aren’t familiar with those kinds of issues  but still—yeah.

When others were struggling  I was the
 one helping them through it. But when I need someone to listen to me  there's no one. It seems like when their life gets back on track  they forget what it's like to need someone’s ear. Also understand that
people are busy and have their life  can't really blame anyone. I may be to needy recently. 

I'm not okay. I know there’s no magic solution to make me feel better instantly. I don’t expect anyone to fully ""understand"" what I’m going through; I just want to talk about the same things over and over  until I feel some relief  and have someone simply listen. Because talking to a human being helps a lot.

So here I am  trying to find someone anonymous to talk to—someone I don’t know  no judgment involved.

Just two people  both wanting someone to listen.

loneliness,I want to die ,i usually don’t ask for help but i’m at my lowest it feels like. my grandma and grandpa both raised me and they both died in 2022. I was only 17 when my grandpa died and just turned 18 when my grandma died. i don’t talk to my younger siblings and my older siblings moved away. I was left with my aunt and she was a slob and it was horrible. I ended up moving out and my job has been cutting my hours and it’s just been hard. I was with a girl but it turned out she was with someone else the whole time and ofc she dropped me.  my whole life i have felt like a nobody. i’m just here because my mom had me. My soul feels so dead. I don’t find enjoyment in anything and I’m always mad and closed off. i want to meet new people but they always end up leaving me or treating me horrible. I’m always being replaced like nothing. i’m so useless in the world. I tried doing things to be gentle with myself and love myself but the pain just always takes over. I even got a cat and i almost still feel lonely. he kinda just adds to my stress. I smoke weed vape and smoke carts and it’s the only thing that gets me through the day. I know im addicted to it but it’s the only thing that can make me feel happy. I’m scared for my health because i do it so much. but no one seems to see how im dying inside. All of my friends left me because of how i am but i can’t help it. i mentally been so depressed and it’s so hard to hide it. i just distance myself so i wont be a burden because i know my sadness ruins everyone’s mood. I just hate myself and i wish i could be better. It just feels like every time i try to change im knocked back down and it hurts. i just need someone to be here it’s so hard being alone at 20. it’s almost like no one cares. i want to die ,9,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1f53vwj/i_want_to_die/
loneliness,It is what it is.,"Just need to vent. I'm 29 now. Been single for getting close to 9 years. In the past it seems like I had terrible choices in women  as I ended up getting cheated on in a few relationships. I remember my last relationship  she was amazing. I had a rough childhood (putting it lightly) growing up.  Throw in the being cheated on  and I built up quite a few layers of walls to prevent being hurt again.

 All it did was ruin the one good relationship I did have. I drove her away. I remember the moment I fell in love with her  there was always this thought in the back of my mind that is too good to be true. It kept nagging at me. She was the one person who treated me like I had actual value for the first time in my life  and it was honestly the strangest feeling I have  ever experienced. 

Anyways  fast forward to now. I have this massive overbearing pressure of feeling alone. It's just been getting worse over the past few weeks. Like I can't breathe and the walls are closing in  I can't quite explain it. I want to talk to someone  but I don't want to burden anybody with my problems. I don't know. I miss having somebody around. You know? Anybody who I have a remote interest in always has somebody. They say dating gets harder  but maybe I'm just not what people want. Always have my father in the back of my mind telling how I'm just garbage  and will never find anybody. Said that years ago when I was growing up  just didn't really expect it to be true. 

I don't know. It hurts. Everything just hurts. But  I refuse to show people that I'm falling apart on the inside. I'm not sure what I expect from this post. The loneliness is crippling  and it feels like I can't do anything about it. 

Oh well. It is what it is. We suffer in silence. Probably will delete this after I stop feeling like this.",12,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1fjb2bo/it_is_what_it_is/

Like  that doesn't make me feel better  I want my thought processes to be challenged  I want to be wrong about the world falling apart and have evidence that I'm wrong and that Im just an idiot whose mind is paranoid over spilled milk; I don't want my darkest fears to be validated",424,88,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1g9dmlu/im_honestly_tired_of_suicide_hotlines_and_mental/
Anxiety,Does anyone else find the idea of death to be extremely comforting not exactly in a suicidal way?,Every time I'm having an anxiety attack about something I can see is small and silly I just think of death and how fragile and temporary life is to find some comfort and it just makes me feel better. I remember being really scared of death as a child/pre teen but now I kinda rely on the inevitability of death and how this is momentary and therefore less important than what I make it sometimes. I don't feel like death is the only way out but it's definitely the easiest one  so if I fail everything else at least I have the certainty it's going away someday.,198,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jf03ld/does_anyone_else_find_the_idea_of_death_to_be/

Anxiety,I got drunk for the first time in over 6 years this weekend. My anxiety is now so bad  that I am considering suicide.,"I haven't drank in many years. This weekend I got drunk. I don't know why I allowed myself to drink  I guess I am not as strong as I thought  and now my anxiety is out of control. It has been almost two days since I drank  but my anxiety is still so bad that I feel that I would rather die than experience one more day feeling this badly. 

I have attempted suicide twice in the past  the last time being 5 years ago. I really don't want to die  but can no longer live with near constant and debilitating anxiety. 

Has anyone ever experienced these feelings after using alcohol? Thanks for reading.

Two weeks ago my mother's boyfriend committed suicide by firearm. I was in the house at the time playing my video game when I heard the blast downstairs. He had been struggling with depression  mental shock of losing his business and had recently been diagnosed with Parkinsons. I struggle with General anxiety and panic disorder and this just took my struggles to the next level. I had found him and the sounds and images haunt my mind daily. I hardly sleep  can't really leave my appartmemt cuz I get super shaken up with fear. My chest is always hurting and I have that lump in my throat feeling all the time along with tremors. Loss of appetite.. on a beta blocker now cuz of it but I just feel like I'm living in ground hogs day. It's terrible. I force myself to walk around my complex and occasionally drive to the store but even there I freak out. It's never been this bad and I just want to feel normal again.

Can’t laugh  don’t feel like talking to people  wanna just sleep but can’t even do that. I’m just so annoyed I would much rather be having panic attacks every day over nothing rather than this because enjoying nothing SUCKS. Never being in the present moment because your mind is just constantly running with dumb thoughts. just needed to rant. ,99,179,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1imlaof/i_would_choose_anxiety_over_depression_any_day/
Anxiety,I think I prefer depression over anxiety,"After a very anxious week I feel burnt out. Now I feel just depressed  the kind of depressive state that is tolerable. 

I feel no sadness and anger  I am just tired and indifferent. My brain is so tired that I have no energy to be anxious. That kinda feels good. Without paralyzing terror I can do small things  not overly passionate  but just good enough. 

My baseline is so low  that I feel happy being just depressed.

Edit: I think it needs to be here  ‘Objectively  depression and anxiety both suck  sometimes **the change** from months long depression to anxiety  and vice versa  **feels better**. Then you realize it is not energy or motivation but anxiety  it is not calmness it is numbness from depression. I really hope you will get better and find help  because those changes between those two are sometimes very misleading  and can be a false promise. Do not postpone the therapy or whatever you were meaning to do or start. And change that baseline of feeling good to a higher norm’.",1742,243,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/gzqpsw/i_think_i_prefer_depression_over_anxiety/

I feel so grateful that I have them and that I was raised and still am surrounded by so much love from them. Every day that we talk I learn something new about their life. It pains me so much to think that one day they won’t be there for a late night chat  to sing songs together or dance  or even just to hug because we love each other.  When I was younger I couldn’t sleepover at other peoples houses without waking up in the middle of the night  hysterically crying for my parents.

Anxiety,How I Overcame DPDR (symptoms  feedback loop  anxiety  my story  tips & advice),"Hi everyone  I really wanted to do/felt like I should make a separate master-post for how I overcame DPDR (depersonalization and derealization) that was triggered by long-term anxiety  as well as some of the symptoms  mechanisms of DPDR  feedback loop  triggers & more.

I made a previous master-post on my long-term anxiety symptoms (which I overcame) where I went over the more bizarre  rarely spoken about  constant symptoms of long-term anxiety  and the feedback loop and it seemed to help a lot of people. I will link that one below  I recommend everyone read it first!

https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/10jcfko/longterm_anxiety_symptoms_i_had_from_someone_who/

A lot of you wanted to know how I overcame the DP/DR symptoms. I didn't realise that I had message requests on Reddit  and now I've got so many spanning across months ago that I can't find the time to get back to individually so I feel like its my duty to make this post and have it all in one place. Warning  this is a big post.

Lets go over some positives first as I find its always best to get off on a positive note  and to have something to look forward to or motivate others:

**1. DP/DR (Depersonalization and Derealization) is not and is never permenant  anyone who says so are catastrophizing and are probably biased or feeling that way due to their own condition not improving. These notions are not helpful and are also not true.**

**It will and can go away 100%  it is not something you have to 'deal' with or 'accept' for the rest of your life.**


**2. DP/DR does not work like a debt system e.g. the longer you are in DP/DR  the longer it is going to take you to get out of it (isn't true!). Everyone has the same chance of success in recovering from DP/DR  no matter how long or short you have been in that state.**
**3. DP/DR is not indicative or a sign of psychosis  and you will not become psychotic if you experience DP/DR.**


DP/DR is a **defense mechanism**  which attempts to make sure that only the body experiences pain or trauma and not the mind  by causing detachment. **Causes of DP/DR can be anxiety attacks  severe stress  health anxiety  drug induced (often from edibles or hallucinogens)  traumatic first-hand or second-hand situations  abuse or any interpersonal trauma. Anyone of any age can experience DP/DR.**

.......................................................................

**What does DP/DR feel like?:**

- Everything feels (and looks) either too close or too far away from you  environments are distorted
- Everything feels flat or 2D  like it isn't quite real or tangible  others faces might feel unreal
- Can feel like the world is slipping away from you
- You might feel like you could fall over any second or fall through the floor
- Speech can feel slow/slurred  like your brain is struggling to find words
- Time can feel like its going too fast or too slow
- Feeling like you can observe yourself outside your body  everything feels disconnected  like you are very alone
- Your limbs can feel too small  too big  like you are taller or shorter than you actually are
- You might feel internally dizzy (like your mind is spinning but your vision isn't)  woozy head feelings  fuzzy head
- More frequent feelings of nostalgia/dejavu
- Colours can feel more dull or distorted
- Feeling numb  like your memories are less tangible or unreal
- Hypochondria (Healthy Anxiety) is often a huge comorbidity with DP/DR

.......................................................................

**The Feedback Loop  what is it?**

Symptoms of DP/DR (as well as Anxiety/Health Anxiety) are often kept alive by or started something called the **Feedback Loop.** This is a loop that is constantly being fed into  which could have started from something as for example:

*You may be minding your own business one day and suddenly experience a Panic Attack  but you misread it as being something worse. You could think you're about to die  that you are having a heart attack because of the palpitations  that you could collapse any moment now  and then it goes... but you're on edge  what if it happens again? Do I have a heart condition? I think I'm dying  I think something is wrong. Everyday you are waking up and checking if you can feel palpitations  you're scared it will happen again  you're getting waves of dread  your mind is full of 'what ifs' over and over again every single day. Then one day  nothing feels real and you feel completely detached from reality and this scares you even more  you feel like you're slipping away  you're terrified and feel like you'll never be normal again. You're waking up everyday to check if everything still feels unreal  and it does  its not going away. Whats happening?*


This is the **Feedback Loop** example which led to DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms. What should've happened when you experienced for example: a Panic Attack  was that **you should've been able to realise it was a Panic Attack and been able to ground yourself or calm down during that situation and it would go away. This would eliminate the start of the Feedback Loop**  but instead by misreading the situation or not having the appropriate tools to manage it  you are now in fear  in high stress and feeling traumatised of the situation in fear it will happen again or that something worse is happening to you. This keeps the Loop alive and going.

**In preparation for the pain or fear you are about to anticipate happening  your body chose to disassociate from your mind and cause DP/DR in order to handle the stress and fear of what you're afraid of experiencing. DP/DR is attempting to save you from what could happen to you next  after being activated from something that already hurt you or traumatised you.**

Identifying the first source of your DP/DR can be particularly important in understanding and learning where your Feedback Loop started. **For some people it can even extend to as far as childhood  which can sometimes result in something known as DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)**. Once you have identified the source  this is the stepping stone into recovering from DP/DR.

Sources of DPDR can be: drug-induced from hallucinogens/edibles/bad trips/alcohol or other substances  anxiety attacks  depression  stress  medical trauma/childhood trauma/adulthood trauma/being a child of divorce  sexual assaults/CSA  PTSD  DID and more

Environments are also very important to be recognised as sources of DPDR e.g. stressful jobs  stressful/abusive relationships  difficult home life  being a full-time carer for family  difficult school life etc

.......................................................................

**So what's going to help me get better?**

There's a lot of resources and therapies available for DP/DR  such as Psychotherapy (talking therapies)  CBT  DBT  EMDR and more.

But what is most important is that you are able to help yourself  as well as having professional support should you require it. **The thing that is going to get you better the most is you  and the tools you can develop to help you in time of need and in how you navigate the world and your trauma**. Some people (like me) may be able to recover from DP/DR without professional intervention or therapies  but it is always incredibly recommended if you have access or can afford it. **With DP/DR being highly trauma related  it is important to have a safe place to unload and traverse trauma with a professional**  as it can be tough to handle alone. **If you are concerned or suspect your DP/DR may be a result of DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)  professional help is absolutely necessary.**

Every person with DP/DR will be completely unique in their needs  what they can handle alone or what they need support with.

.......................................................................

**What can we do for ourselves?**

This is going to go over some self-practices and tools you can do in your own time to help yourself while actively experiencing DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms  and also how to reduce the chances of re-experiencing it when you are recovered.

**Staying Busy & Challenging Yourself:**

A big part of dissolving the Feedback Loop is by no longer feeding into it  and one way of doing this is by diverting our thoughts from the feelings of DP/DR or anxiety symptoms. **You want to find or make opportunities where you don't have time to think about DP/DR  or how it makes you feel  'scanning' for feelings or signs of it  and to challenge those feelings instead.**
**DP/DR and anxiety is the perfect time to get busy and involved with life**  whether it is your hobbies  being with your friends and family  doing chores that need to be done  starting things you've always wanted to do. **It can feel scary  even terrifying to partake in these things when you feel unreal  like you're not present or that the world is slipping away  but you must keep pushing through**. Once you begin to challenge yourself and challenge those feelings of 'not feeling real' you begin to establish trust within yourself.

**Don't be disheartened that DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms do not disappear right away overnight  this is because your body hormonally  needs time to acclimate to low levels of stress and anxiety after having been kept at such high levels. If these hormones were to plummet immediately  the body wouldn't be able to cope  so it likes to decline it gently! So consider it like you are establishing trust:**

DP/DR has been in the drivers seat all this time  and you've been the passenger in the back. You're finally insisting on being in the driver's seat  but DP/DR insists on being the passenger right next to you. DP/DR is going to freak out in the passenger seat and take the wheel from you at times during some tough situations because its not sure you can navigate it on your own  and instead of letting it take the driver's seat again you need to say to it  'Don't worry. I've got this'. and DP/DR will let go of the wheel. This in real life  would be an example of you handling the situation you are in and challenging yourself to face what makes you afraid (such as going outside in case you feel 'unreal').

**By doing this  you are establishing trust and are giving DP/DR the opportunity to know that you can handle the situation on your own. Eventually with time of practicing these things  DP/DR will get out of the car entirely and you can 'drive' all by yourself again and those feelings of DP/DR will be gone. You'll be able to live your life without things like anxiety or DP/DR dictacting where it takes you or how it makes you feel. You will have formed that trust that you can handle experiencing your pain  your fear  your trauma  your anxiety/stress etc. without the need of the defence mechanism of DP/DR. You will become the first line of defence!**

From personal experience this is what accelerated me to my complete recovery from DP/DR and long-term anxiety symptoms within 3-4 months of this practice after struggling for almost a year of non-stop DP/DR and anxiety symptoms. **I learned to empathise with my DP/DR's attempt at trying to keep me safe and acknowledged that it was only doing this in order to make me feel better  albeit in a scary and inconvenient way! So by learning techniques and also teaching myself not to be scared of DP/DR symptoms or my anxiety symptoms  I gave myself the opportunity to be the one in control and say ''Hey  I am totally capable of caring for myself now. Thank you for your help and what you tried to do for me'' to my DP/DR.**

By feeling afraid to participate in activities or doing things because you might feel unreal  or because the world feels distorted  you are allowing DP/DR to maintain control and are keeping DP/DR as an option

**Challenge yourself in incriments or in steps  and remember to reward yourself afterwards. Figure out what about DP/DR makes you afraid:**

**is it seeing people's faces? particularly friends or family?** - challenge yourself towards looking at faces  engaging with familiar faces (YouTubers  family  partners)  if you can touch their face then touch it  grounding exercises where you say ''I can see two eyes  they are [insert colour]  they have a [description] nose  do they have freckles? birth marks? do they have any smile lines? identify parts of their face and describe them'' this helps make them more tangible and less scary. Do little challenges before the bigger ones.

**is it going outside in case you feel unreal? woozy?** - challenge yourself towards small  short walks up and down your street  to eventually longer walks  acknowledge that you might be feeling dizzy/unreal but that you are safe  be kind & go home if you need it  try again another day  stay engaged with your hobbies/the outside world

**is it the feeling that you'll never be the same again? that you think its permenant? that you've ruined your life?** - The first thing you'll see if you look up 'can dpdr be permenant' is 'no!' and every other article will say no. There has never been an observed case of DPDR being permenant  and you won't be the first case of that happening. Its really important you do not entertain or engage with people who believe it is permenant  or that theirs is permenant because they are just people who are keeping their own DPDR alive with the negativity. I recommend writing positive affirmations or reading them  and engaging with positive stories of DPDR recovery and sticking with facts. **You have not ruined your life  and you will recover.**
**DPDR can make you feel afraid of lots of things  not just the ones I described above (but those are the most common).**

**Grounding Exercises:**
Grounding is a way to refocus and bring your attention back to the present and the world around you. This is can be used when experiencing fear or anxiety of your current DP/DR state  but is **most effective when you feel like it is 'coming on' or you are experiencing anxiety/stress that could lead to it.**

Grounding exercises can involve:

- Naming 5 things you can see  name 4 things you can touch and to touch them  naming 3 things you can hear and listening to them  what 2 things can you smell  1 thing you can taste.
- Holding ice cubes  putting your hands in cold water  picking up or touching things and explaining how it feels (is it cold  warm  does it feel rough or soft)  identifying their colours deeply
- Walks without music  tuning into the sounds of your steps  counting your steps  observing your surroundings on your walks  sitting in the grass and touching it.
- Mental anchoring by saying (in your head or quietly to yourself) your full name  your age  where you live  what street you live on  the date  where you are  what you're doing. Repeat this gently until you feel calm.
- Self-assurance phrases such as  ''You are okay''  ''Nothing can hurt me''  ''You will get through this''  ''I've done this once and I can do it again'' etc.

**My Example of How I Personally Recovered from DPDR:**

For me I dealt with a lot of wooziness/dizziness during my DP/DR and I felt terrified to do anything sitting up or standing because I'd have to acknowledge that dizzy feeling and the unreal-ness from DP/DR  so I would lie on my side all day while watching TV or playing games instead to cope. **I wanted to turn 'Oh god  no I'm dizzy and woozy and nothing feels real  I'm so scared' into 'Oh I'm dizzy and feel unreal today? Lets see what I can manage'.**

It started to become more of 'Let's get up! Lets engage with the same hobbies but lets sit up this time'. I'd do that for as long as I feel I could handle the dizzines and unreal sensations  and then I'd lie back down again. I rewarded myself and cared for myself with a technique that brought me comfort  while having succeeded in engaging with something that scared me or was difficult. Over time I'd start to sit up for longer  or I'd start to go outside on short walks (which was particularly hard as I'd feel more unreal outside than at home)  and I would feel unreal  like everything was flat  like the world was slipping away but I did it.

Some days I would just cry or feel like I took steps back  that I'd be stuck forever but I kept going and I kept rewarding myself after those times with either little lie downs  eating things I really loved  engaging in self-care or watching familiar TV shows I know I loved. Over time I started to sit up a lot more  I started to stand more  I started to go out more and for much  much longer each time  I started to do all the things I loved again despite how I felt. **Don't get me wrong  I still felt unreal and dizzy but I wanted to stop being scared of it and to not let it stop me engaging with things I loved or wanted to do.**

**I stopped basing my days and thoughts on 'how good I'm feeling' and more so on 'how well can I manage today'.** That took away a lot of pressure for me  as I knew I would not feel better over night but I would learn to manage my days better  so focusing on that intrinsically helped me feel better. You'll want to learn how to manage bad days (whether DPDR days  anxious days  stressful days) because when you do  you'll become prepared for if you ever face any of those times again and you can conquer it!

One day after months of challenging myself  being more present  doing my hobbies  going outside (I remember this vividly) I was hugging my partner and I looked up at his face and I physically jumped  **he looked real. I started looking around everywhere and everything felt real  everything looked so colorful  the world didn't feel flat or distorted  everything felt 'real' and 'right' and when I touched my partner's face it felt so tangible and real.** I don't think I've ever cried that hard in my life from happiness  my DPDR was gone.

Everything probably felt like this for a while  but because I was so engrossed in engaging with the world around me and doing the things I loved I didn't actually realise it  because I was no longer questioning my reality or looking for signs of DP/DR. **So that one moment where I finally remembered to 'check' my reality  it made me realise everything felt real again and that I felt human again. And it never came back.**

When you feel ready  the key is to be kind to yourself as well as challenge yourself against your DPDR and how it makes you feel. By pushing through and engaging with the world around you bit by bit you will start to establish that trust  those tools  in convincing your body that you can handle yourself and that it no longer needs to detach with DPDR to keep you safe.

.......................................................................

**Some habits to get into  and some to get rid of:**

- **Cut out all alcohol and all drugs absolutely and completely  as well as caffeine & reduce or quit smoking.** All of these substances will have an effect on the hormones in your body  and can impede progress from DP/DR due to the sensations it can produce and will generally stress out the body  and mind-altering drugs like hallucinogens or Cannabis can worsen DP/DR greatly or keep it around. *If you are an addict or suffer from addictions  get in touch with services that can help you taper  detox or navigate potential sobriety  do not attempt any of this alone.*

- **Establish a normal bedtime routine**  ideally getting into bed at 9-10pm and waking up before 9am. Some people need more sleep than others so wake up at whatever time in the morning before 9am is best for you; getting adequate sleep will greatly improve the rate of which your DP/DR can dissolve as your mind will be most lucid  alert and prepared to handle potential stressors. **Sleeping too much or too little can greatly affect your brain and hormone regulation  and you need the best hormone regulation in order for the body to lower cortisol levels which leads to DP/DR symptoms rapidly improving.**

- **Stay hydrated and well-fed.** This is really typical mental health advice  but in general you will want to make sure you are hydrated and well-fed so the body has enough energy supply to handle stressors  anxiety and to ensure the mind is as lucid and energised as possible. You will need all the energy you can possibly get  and having these bases covered can really improve your symptoms.

- **Get checked for any Vitamin Deficiencies** as a lot of Vitamins we can be deficient in will greatly effect circadian rhythms  heart rhythms  the brain (deficiencies can cause brain fog  low motor skill function and poor hormone regulation). **Making sure we have healthy  functioning foundations to work off of greatly supports mental function and our ability to take on new information and learn new things (such as therapeutic tools and treatment).**

- **Identify your stressors and reduce them  identify your triggers and navigate them.** Cortisol levels increase with stress (from stressors) and anxiety  when we are faced with high levels of cortisol for extended periods of time  the body can produce bizzare and scary symptoms (which are harmless).

Anxiety,Doc won’t refill Xanax  recommends “self help videos” on YouTube instead.,"Xanax helped me so much. I’ve had prescriptions on and off for years  never been addicted and only taken once or twice weekly. I have severe panic attacks and it seems to be the only thing that helps. 

Recently my doctor told me he won’t fill it anymore and recommends that I listen to self help videos on YouTube instead. Piss off! As if I haven’t watched every video about the topic over the past 3 years.

I’m tempted to try and look for another doctor that will prescribe it  but I also don’t want to look like a drug addict. Idk man  it’s the only thing that has been keeping me from spiraling the past 6 months. Just knowing that I have a plan b in case I can’t calm myself down is enough to calm me down ironically. 

Currently having a horrible panic attack that has lasted over an hour and I really wish I had something.",530,436,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/10wmsbv/doc_wont_refill_xanax_recommends_self_help_videos/
Anxiety,this subreddit crucifies benzos when they saved my life,"it’s so frustrating coming on to an ANXIETY subreddit and seeing benzos being stigmatized. 

*TW* suicidal ideation

i’m a 22 year old high school and college dropout due to severe panic disorder  agoraphobia  and GAD. i have never held a steady job. i live my life convinced i’m going to die daily. i wake up panicky  and a lot of times i go to sleep wondering if i’ll die during it. my panic attacks are atypical— they last for hours  coming in waves. i have lost substantial amounts of weight during bad “flareups”. i have had severe suicidal ideation because the thought of taking my own life seemed easier than living in constant fear. i have been on Prozac  Lexapro  Celexa  Zoloft  Paxil  Pristiq  Cymbalta  Lamotrigine  Abilify  Risperdal  Seroquel  Zyprexa  and a couple more off label medications since i was 12. i have tried EMDR  CBT  IOP  and have been inpatient. i’ve seen a therapist since i was 10. so please  don’t you dare tell me that there’s no place for benzos when they’re the only things that make me feel normal.

i started taking 1 mg lorazepam as needed when i was 12. i hardly took it; drug addiction runs in my family. but living was a struggle. as i developed and became more mature  my anxiety got substantially worse. i was prescribed 7 pills every 3 months. however  when the pandemic hit and i was in my psychiatrist’s office shaking inconsolably  i was given 1 pill a day to keep me out of emergency rooms  since that is where my panic attacks would often make me end up. for the first time in a long time  i felt normal. i started my first job as a doordasher. on benzos  i felt like any other 20 something with their whole life ahead of them. for the first time  i saw what it was like to live without fear. 

in the last 2 and a half years  i have built a tolerance and my dose has had to be upped by another mg. however  i fight every day to take less than the dosage given. i’m exhausted because i spend all of my time convincing myself i’m not going to die. but when i finally give in and take what i’m prescribed  i feel like i can do anything a normal person can do.

i’m terrified of withdrawal  of course i am. but my psychiatrist (who is seeing that the medicinal options are starting to run out)  decided that giving me daily benzos would give me a substantially better quality of life. it is not ideal. of course it’s not. he made that clear as well. i know about the scary withdrawals and the memory loss (which i thankfully haven’t really experienced) that comes from long term use. give me a different option and i’ll try anything. 

but you know what? if this is what i need to live a fulfilled life  then fuck it. this is what i’ll do. since on it  i’ve been able to travel without my parents  earn my own money  enjoy my life  and cultivate a healthy relationship. i’m tired of how stigmatized benzos are. i’m tired of coming onto this subreddit and seeing how they’re the devil’s drug— worse than heroin and feeling guilty for needing it. 

trust me  nobody would choose this. but i’d rather live a shorter fulfilled life needing benzos than live a long life filled with constant fear and anxiety.

edit: i continue to get replies and messages so i wanted to give an update. it has been 2 years since my post. a little while after i wrote this  i was prescribed pristiq and ended up getting serotonin syndrome as i apparently absorb SSRIs/SNRIs unusually— which is why they always did more harm than good for me. i was told i should never take serotonin again  which has made benzo accessibility quite easy and has helped all my doctors understand why i take them daily. i am no longer stigmatized for it in my day to day life. 

i continue to take 2 mg a day  and have gotten my life back. i now travel the country and the world  go out daily  and have just picked out my engagement ring (when he proposes is the surprise). benzos work as an aid  but i don’t rely on them anymore. progressive muscle relaxation is the number 1 thing that has helped me outside of benzos and exposure therapy. i have no adverse affects like memory loss  cognitive decline  balance issues  etc. obviously  it’s no one’s first choice  but i’m back to loving my life and it’s at least in part due to benzos. do what’s best for you  advocate for yourself  and i will continue to reply to any questions. all love!",793,291,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/y9p3sc/this_subreddit_crucifies_benzos_when_they_saved/
Anxiety,Does coffee make anxiety worse? or is it that way only if i don't have a cup daily? I think i accidentally made myself a caffeine addict. help??,"trigger warning for caffeine addiction (or addiction being in the title) was under advice needed but wasn't sure so tagged it as TW instead.

Been drinking a lot of coffee (6 cups daily) for quite some time  cause i like coffee. I hadn't noticed a difference as to whether it did actually make anxiety worse or not. I wanna try to stop the caffeine as am worried it might be a caffeine addiction at this point.

not having coffee before doing anything today; i finally experienced what caffeine withdrawl is. shaking  jittery and maybe more scarish/jumpy before having that first cup.

I want to stop drinking coffee (or at least the caffinated stuff  and bought decaf  wanted to burn through all the caffinated stuff fast tho to get rid of it)  and idk how long the caffeine withdrawl will happen if i just stop cold turkey. 

anyone else experience this? how do you stop drinking coffee? I probably don't need the caffeine. wanted to test not drinking it as idk how it affects my anxiety.",2,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/15e8won/does_coffee_make_anxiety_worse_or_is_it_that_way/
Anxiety,Please stop medication shaming,"This is a PSA to the anxiety community. It's bad enough when you get it from people who don't even understand the concept of having anxiety  it's 10x worse when it comes from people within the community who also suffer from anxiety disorders.

Goddamn I get it left and right from fellow anxiety sufferers the very moment I mention that I'm on medication. It always turns into preaching. You may think you're helping  but you're really not. There are many different preachy topics people get into  but the main sentiments are ""oh  you're just not strong enough and are weak and leaning on the meds because not using them would be too hard for you."" Or ""oh they're really bad for you if you keep taking those you're going to end up with dementia-cancer by the age of 30"" 

Fuck off. I experienced something traumatic. I was not able to handle it without the assistance of meds. Therapy alone did not cut it. Going for walks outside or whatever didn't help either  which some people smugly like to suggest. I was in so much fear that I literally disassociated from myself. Meds kept me from being hospitalized.

I got shit from my doctor and people on here (not this sub specifically I haven't commented here before). You're going to die horribly for being on those meds! be afraid! be scared! feel ashamed!

Well guess what  I found a fantastic therapist who completely understands my plight. In one of our first sessions when I told her that the meds saved my life and that therapy alone wouldn't have ever helped  she IMMEDIATELY agreed and was like ""oh yep definitely. It's too powerful of a reaction/feeling. I know."" She herself experienced some trauma from her past  and she told me that when she stopped drinking and was on an anti-anxiety med for her panic disorder someone smugly told her ""oh so you dropped one addiction for another."" Oh boy did I have some shared anger with her over that. 

I really don't care to hear anyone's ""help"" or ""advice"" when it comes to my choice to take medications. I don't want your shaming  or how you were able to overcome your issues without medication  good for you. I don't want to hear how bad it is for me health-wise. There's this holier-than-thou preachy mindset disguised as sympathy and I fucking hate it. OOooOOoo they're so bad for you! Guess what's also bad for me? Not eating or sleeping or fulfilling basic biological needs to survive due to fear. Hm. Wonder which is worse?

I would rather live a shorter happier life due to relief from my anxiety due to meds than live a long tortuous life because that's what people say I should do. My doctor was brutal to me about being on the meds until I said essentially that to her  and then she finally laid off. 

And addiction doesn't happen to everybody. I had someone lecture me on how this medication I was on was going to give me a full blown addiction until I told them that once I was doing better I just simply got off of them and was off of them for months. They sure didn't have anything to say to that. 

So bottom line  stop shaming people who choose medications  if you want to celebrate that you're so healthy and untainted by pharmaceuticals  go do it somewhere else. Not everyone is that lucky. Yes I'm bitter.

edit: to be clear all of this mostly comes from the fact that I take **benzos ** which are apparently a big no-no to many people. I'm not sure if I would have had the same experience from people if I were taking non-benzos. People really love to scare me about those. But they saved my life and continue to do so  so  *shrug.*",936,345,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/mhlufw/please_stop_medication_shaming/
Anxiety,Reminder to be careful with benzodiazepines.,"I'm not demonizing benzos or people who take them at all. I still safely take Xanax once or twice a week and it's extremely helpful for my panic attacks or just any type of severe anxiety I'm going through.  

I just wanted to remind everyone to be careful. I feel like some doctors aren't clear enough on how often you should usually take them if it's a permanent med you want to have in your life to take occasionally and ""as needed"". My doctor basically told me nothing when prescribing me Xanax as a teenager and it didn't go well because I used it everyday. It was complete HELL getting off of it.  

Long term consistent and everyday use can eventually cause addiction/dependency which is seriously one of the worst feelings in the world especially the withdrawal that can come with it. Severe withdrawal that happens from being dependent on larger doses can even be dangerous. 

Be sure to ask your doctor any questions you have before starting them. Like I said before I'm not trying to demonize benzos or anyone who takes them. Not looking to scare anyone either I just don’t want anyone to go through what I did as a teenager when I didn't know much about the topic before it was too late. 

Benzodiazepines can be an amazingly helpful tool and medication when used the right way. Just be careful friends that is all. ",128,96,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jl1ib0/reminder_to_be_careful_with_benzodiazepines/
Anxiety,Addicted to weed because it helps my anxiety.,"Here I am high once again. Now I bet your guessing that I’ve been smoking for years to be addicted to weed. Nope. I have only been smoking daily for about a month now. I used to be the most anti-weed person on the planet. I even ended a serious relationship of mine over it years ago. I believed it did nothing for you other than make you a lazy bum. Fast forward a bit and now I use weed daily to cope with my anxiety disorder. I’ve been battling my anxiety for over a year now. I’ve tried the meds  therapy  quit vaping  quit caffeine  and even incorporated healthy habits like meditation/exercise into my daily routine. Still with all of these things I was battling anxiety. Panic attacks weekly if not daily. Constantly living somewhere between depersonalization and derealization. Thought about suicide many times. How life can never be the same for me again because of my anxiety. Some of my goals will never be achieved because of it and I had to learn to accept that. I was an outgoing go-getter to now someone afraid to confront a stranger. A few months ago my current girlfriend recommended trying weed (she used to smoke but doesn’t now). I didn’t want to do weed but was opened to CBD. So I tried full-spectrum CBD for a few months with mostly positive effects but then one day it seemed like it just kinda stopped working. I still have CBD products to use when I can’t smoke but more on that topic in just a bit. So I look into weed for helping with my anxiety since some people do say it works. I can attest weed has fixed a lot of my anxiety. 

I feel alive again. I actually feel like leaving my house for once. The world used to seem like a bad place for so long and now I look at it with a brand new perspective even when I’m sober. Now it seems beautiful with opportunities everywhere. I look forward to going to work again. My relationship is the best it’s been this past year. Friends tell me they see a night and day difference in my personality even while I’m sober. The thing is I learn a lot about myself while high. It gives me the power to see through all the “noise” and find my true self. Learning these things has helped me live a better life while sober. It helps make me see what my anxious thoughts are and what my real thoughts are. I just feel like I have to smoke daily to keep my anxiety down. Now going back to my CBD comment. I believe THC has worked so well for me because it provides symptoms similar to my specific anxiety. The confusion  the off balances  the world not seeming real even. These are things I feel when I have anxiety but my body looks as anxiety as bad  but when I smoke and experience these symptoms it tricks my brain into thinking I’m high and high is a good thing. Weed helps with making you a happier person as well of course. These things really help my anxiety compared to CBD. Because it seems like the CBD can only do so much for me. 

So you are probably wondering why am I worried about being addicted to weed if my life has improved in every aspect? Well I’m worried I’m going to have to be high every minute to be alive. I worry that I’ll wake up one day 5 years from now wondering where the time went. I have goals to achieve and when I’m sober I do pursue these goals  but if I’m high I can only think about them. Now I have made LEAPS of progress towards some task/goals of mine over this past month. I just don’t want to get to a point where I have to be high to live. I also feel like when I’m high I don’t worry enough about some of the important things. I kinda just blow them off to worry about when I’m sober. This is something else I fear will become a bigger issue if I continue to smoke regularly. But if I don’t smoke regularly then I could go back to feeling antisocial  scared  and into hiding. Going back to a person that I’m ashamed I’ve become. 2 days from now I have an appointment to go get my medical marijuana card. I feel like once I get that then I’m signing myself up for quite a long period of time of smoking regularly. A part of me says to quit while I’m ahead  but the other part I also doesn’t want to go back to living the life I was just over a month ago. Let me know what you guys think I should do.

Side notes: I have to be very careful with the amount I smoke because my 2nd panic attack which was actually the worst one I ever experienced came from smoking weed at a party. So I smoke very little amounts at a time. Also getting my MMC would allow me to choose a good strain for anxiety purposes. The reason why I want the card is because I want to get rid of the anxiety of using it illegally.",1,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/yodhmk/addicted_to_weed_because_it_helps_my_anxiety/
Anxiety,What supplements or meds may help my moderate to severe social anxiety (as well as some general anxiety and moderate self esteem issues)? (No benzos or addictive ones),"I’ve tried ssri’s which caused too many issues for me  even when coupled with Wellbutrin which did help decrease ssri side effects but also added some anxiety back.

I’ve tried ashwagandha which is decent but it causes me to become robotic and lose my emotion  maybe due to it increasing serotonin which lowers dopamine. 

I’ve also tried (and loved) gabapentin but I overused it and ran out early. Probably was close to crossing the line onto addiction with it. Definitely less addictive than benzos of course but addictive nonetheless. I also used phenibut which I was heavily addicted to and had horrible withdrawal. However  these meds worked wonders so I think for me things that boost gaba help the most.

Because of the gaba chemicals seeming to help the most  I tried taurine which gave me some mild relief but then gives me rebound anxiety that almost feels like a mild alcohol hangover so that’s a no-go.

Does anyone know of any other supplements that help with social anxiety? I’m also currently in therapy and have done CBT in the past. I just struggle at work a lot and then waste a lot of my off time ruminating over conversations and situations from work while worrying about having to go in the next day.

Anxiety,What’s worse  anxiety or loneliness?,Yesterday my cat died. So I’m going through the grief of that. I’ve had cats since 2009. Now they are all gone.

Anxiety,School and loneliness is sucking the life out of me,"I hate going to school. But being in it somehow is the real problem  its rather knowing i will have to go to it. When its holiday  im sick or its simply the weekend  im quite fine  i can do whatever and usually i enjoy it. When im at school i usually dont feel that bad either  just bored or irritaded. I go to the same school as my gf and im happy when im talking to them during the breaks. Same as im happy if i go out with someone after school.

When im at school  im mostly thinking about how much i want to go home  but when i get home and im alone  after about 3 hours of doing random stuff i just feel so empty and full of anxiety  i cant enjoy anything. That is when i dont take any drugs  if i take kratom  weed or something similar  i feel quite ok  but im of course not able nor willing to take that everyday....

Anxiety,Stuck in Loneliness  Trying to Find a Way Out,"
I don’t really know why I’m posting this  but I feel like I need to get it out. Lately  I’ve been feeling so alone  like I’m just floating through life with no real connection to anyone. I look around and see people with friends  with love  with purpose – and here I am  just existing.

I try to reach out  but it never feels like enough. The conversations feel shallow  the connections fleeting. I don’t know how to bridge the gap between myself and the world. It’s like I’m stuck in this endless cycle of wanting to be seen but never truly feeling like I am.

I guess I'm just tired of pretending everything’s fine when inside  it really isn’t. Maybe someone else feels this way too  but it’s hard to admit sometimes. Just needed to say it out loud.

Anxiety,I want to kill myself.,"I was going to do it a while ago  but I decided against it. I thought  I'll just see a few friends over the summer  have some fun  I'll feel much better.

Three weeks in  I haven't seen anyone  I made arrangements to go out and then they ditched me as a 'joke'  I see people having fun  going on holiday  meeting friends and going out on snapchat  Instagram  Facebook  everything.

I've developed this inferiority complex where I see everyone being better than me in every way  and then I get these thoughts  suicidal ones. 

""Why stay on this planet if I'm nothing""  that kinda shit. I wrote a list of reasons to kill myself  and day upon day ive been adding to it over and over again. 

Maybe some people should just die if they will be no use to society. Over population is a genuine concern  maybe I should just end it now and spare a few resources.

I get to extremely jealous and angry  I'm so anxious in public  thinking ""do I look fat/ugly/stupid""  and I usually do look fat/ugly/stupid.

I'm split between two homes  my dads side and my mums side are constantly at war with one another  I get anxious just going back to my dad's house  I can't do it anymore.

But here's the funny thing. I desperately want to end my life  however I don't want to use any of the methods I've found.

Anxiety,Can't decide if I just have a maladaptive coping mechanism or if something else is going on,"So I (20m) have been dealing with this... thing in my mind for about three years. I say thing because I'm not sure what it is. I have diagnosed disorders  including dissociative tendencies  but I also have an over active imagination  along with a lovely history of multiple sources of trauma. I am barely getting over said trauma and I am becoming aware of maladaptive coping mechanisms that I have developed over time. 

About three years ago during a period of involuntary social withdrawal (emotionally unstable mother/always sucked at being social appropriate/kids at school turned out to be liars) if about a year I wrote a random silly story and I drew one of the characters. And well I thought he looked pretty hot  and instantly I fell in love with this drawing. It wasn't a remarkable drawing  just a doodle. I immediately started fantasizing about a life with this man  had nothing to do with the story  I just fell in love with how he looked  and I created someone in my mind I could fantasize about  and how much I would've loved for him to come get me out of my unfortunate circumstances. And this persisted  I said at the beginning that I was in complete control of it and as long as I wasn't having hallucinations then it wasn't anything concerning. Well obviously it spiraled out of control  more and more I just wanted to find *him*  wherever he was  so that he could help me get my life together  and I started to believe he was real. I imagined every way we could meet  and I always was thinking of him  and waiting  and how my life would be happy and he would be there. 

Well I haven't always had the best luck with dating  and that wasn't changing any time soon  you don't need to be dating when you're a teenager  but I was a dropout. Whenever I was able to go out  I was always looking for him around the corner  but he was never there. I went off to job corps  and was obsessed with hoping he would be there  and nothing could prevent us from being together  I began to believe he was real  I began to imagine his memories  I made up his whole life and I started to convince myself it was real  and that he was coming  I just had to wait. Well whoopsies got kicked out(no I'm not telling) on my 18th birthday  got sent home right to the pit of my trauma  and it took me three months to get a grip on myself  acknowledge that I was a damn adult  and I hopped out the window to go be homeless cus my mom was not ready for me to independent at all  but she was only making mental dysfunction even worse and it was the best option for me. Well now I was out on the streets  running around with this delusion of a savior partner  if only we would meet  and I started getting connected with resources that would help me get on my feet  and two months later I got myself a job  but whoopsies  burned out too hard because my mental health was still junk and couldn't handle working  had adequate work performance for 7 months  except for all the gaps when I didn't  and then at the end I was given an ultimatum and I quit. Took the last paycheck and drove six hours to a whole new town  convinced myself he must be there  oh yes I didn't stop thinking every day that I just had to keep working and he would show up and my life would ""begin"" and I wouldn't have to worry about a financial or companionship need ever again. Lol  that still wasn't in the cards for me  and I slept in my car for three weeks waiting for him to show up  very embarrassing looking back now  and well because he's not real  he's not real at all  he has never breathed a breath of air  he didn't show up. Week long phsyc ward visit later and I took this ring I had gotten for him and I threw it off a bridge  really wish I would've waited longer to try to sell it but oh well. And it had been a whole year of homelessness between the two towns combined and I got myself into a transitional living facility  and started working on dismantling this thing.

During this time I fought tooth and nail with myself to force myself into any relationship that was at least with an actual person  lol nope still not in the cards for me  so I gave up on dating apps or hookups  I really did try to be social in public too  but I couldn't seem to find anyone in my age range  so I've just thrown my arms up and given up on even trying. I forgot to mention that beyond the delusions of thinking this man was real  I also believed he was God and that I had a duty to love him to restore power to God so that I could escape Earth  that whole thing in the middle  very embarrassing. I told a therapist that I had(past tense) delusions of grandeur and he remarked that usually people don't break their own delusions  well I did  so that's that. I mention this because there was very much an alleged spiritual aspect to this  or at least I thought so  but everything has pointed me in the direction of ""no he's not real or your soul mate  drop it"" which I am trying to do  but I can't. And that's my problem.

I moved up to live with family in a third town  and I'm going to college  my grades are good and I'm getting better each day. But he's still there. I've tried all sorts of prayer  I've tried to villanize him  I've tried to ignore urges to seek him out  I've tried so much to make myself understand that just because my mom was unhinged that doesn't mean the rest of my family is  I've tried to surround myself with social support so that I won't feel like thinking of him  but he's always there  always there to hold me  always there to accompany me. Now let me be clear  I have never had a visual/auditory hallucination in my life. I have never spoken to him  and he has never spoken to me  he exists entirely within my imagination. And that's what's bothering me  and what has led me to believe that he is just a maladaptive coping mechanism  my brain provided me a companion during a very traumatic and isolated part of my life and now I can't make him go away  he is going to be there until he is no longer needed. And I don't think that's fair  I don't think it's fair that I can't figure out what this thing is  that both mental and spiritual work has not gotten rid of him  how could it? I structured my whole survival off of finding him  I imagined a life time together with him. When I say I thought of him all the time  I meant it  I wanted him every minute of the day. I've gotten far enough over the last year to at least be willing to say he's not real  but there's still that part of me that is holding out for him  and I just want it gone  I want that energy and hope to help in other parts of my healing  I don't want to hold on to it anymore  I don't know what's wrong with me  and I'm tired of having to restart therapy because I keep moving and now I'm in a small ass town that doesn't have a wide variety of therapists to choose from  not anyone who's specially trained for whatever is wrong with me  and this damn imaginary friend/dissociative business always gets steamrolled by all the other damn trauma I still haven't processed and I don't know how to get help for it because I can't even label it  it's treatment resistant  I refuse to take antipsychotics because I do not have schizophrenia and when I was placed on Abilify wayyy before this whole business started (about 9 months before that fateful date for 7 days  forced on to me because I kept ""lashing out"" and yelling at my mom because she victimized me) I felt awful  constant leg tremors and fatigue that made me actually unstable  and I feel like restricting my dopamine would just kill my personality  I think it would kill ""me"". Antidepressants (SSRI's/SNRI's) do not work on me at all  tried them for years and years and only got fat from them  (they also don't work if you're actually stuck in a traumatic living environment where you're constantly exposed to hopelessness/helplessness) antianxiety meds actively make me depressed  and all I got out of this is an OCD diagnosis  still don't know what to do with it. 

I just- I don't need a relationship  having one entirely in my mind has just burned me out. But he's still there  to fill in the gaps whenever some part of me calls out to him  always a loyal companion  taunting me with what I can't have. I wish I could look at my family and feel cared for. I wish I could sit by myself without dissociating/daydreaming. I wish I could pin point what this was  and make it stop. He won't go away until he is no longer needed  but you know that idea of ""if you keep wishing for something you're not gonna get it""? Well I believe that  and I believe that I just don't get to have a relationship in this life  not as long as he won't go away. I want him gone because I now believe he is stopping me from enjoying life and recovering. Or should I just accept it? Should I stop feeling so distressed about his presence? I just get so sad cuddling with my pillows  I don't want to be so obsessed with a romantic relationship  I wish I could believe my family and friends when they say they care  I want to live life in the moment  and not in some far off place in my mind. My psych was thinking of looking into drug based therapies since I believe in medical marijuana  but in the meantime I just don't know what to do with myself.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1j8k5dj/cant_decide_if_i_just_have_a_maladaptive_coping/

Anxiety,Everyone told me I had severe anxiety. They were all wrong,"For the past 50 days I have been going through it. Every day I've felt like I can't breathe and like I'm having a heart attack. Normally  your body breathes subconsciously and you don't even think about it. But when I would get these episodes  it felt as if I had to think about every breathe. It honestly felt like I was dying.

I was told these were panic attacks and I was stressed  but I didn't feel stressed and my heart rate never went up during these episodes.

I started to pick up on a pattern  it seemed to always happen 2 hours after eating...but sometimes I would eat very little and it would still happen. I went fully down the anxiety rabbit hole with anxiety medicine  seeking therapy  everything  but none of it helped.

Well fast forward to today  and I've realized I'm allergic to gluten. I cut out gluten and it has totally fixed the issue. It was very frustrating having so many doctors  family  and friends tell me I had an axiety issue when it was very much a health issue. I wish you all luck in finding what works for you and hopefully this helps someone.

Anxiety,Am i going crazy? I feel like i can't escape this one theme and its taking a massive toll on me,Going through a major bout of existential anxiety  all started a month ago from a video about how we all could be fake or in a simulation or a brain in a vat and its put me in the worst rut of my life. I've been making slow progress and hit an all time low but was making small progress. To put into perspective i still get this anxiety badly enough that i have been maximum 6 hours sleep a day and i still wake up feeling super ill with anxiety (nausea and shaking) but it goes off after a few hours and i can at least 'exist' and find fun things to do  a week ago i couldn't even function as a human so at least i was working on myself. Today i felt super positive but always have stuff on my mind like what if i am in hell? or a coma. Anyways as i was going to the kitchen today to speak with my mum but then my vision clouded and i saw shadow figures outside my window for a split second and it went and its put me back into a full on rut where i feel i'm certainly in hell and everything is fake and im going to be punished and this is all a sick joke or something. It feels so so insane to say and it makes me feel even more ill as i can't disprove anything  what about if i am alone but then again this is insane for me to say. Even i can realize that i'm going insane which makes me feel even more ill as what if i have something seriously wrong with me? I felt like i wasn't anxious nearly as much as any other days and felt on the 'up' so how could this happen? Lack of sleep? Serious mental problem? Brain tumor? or am i really alone and in hell or something.

Anxiety,Anyone else can't have more than 1 thing going on at a time?,"I've never quite found the words to explain this  but basically my brain literally can't handle dealing with more than one thing happening in my life at a time. I've now reached a point where I can't even hold down a job or take care of my family etc (I'm 27F for reference). I am literally overwhelmed 24/7/365. For example  I can't handle a relationship while working full-time. If I have a dentist appointment  I need to cancel all my other plans for that day to do just that. It's not that I don't have the time  I just somehow feel too overwhelmed to work 9-5 and then have to come home and talk to someone. I signed up for a weekend yoga class  but the only times I've managed to show up was when I was unemployed and living alone lol. 

I recently left a high-paying tech career because I was too overwhelmed with having to go to work AND handle health issues AND chores at home AND relationships etc. This is not the gen Z complaints of workin g 9-5: I genuinely enjoyed working tech  and I was treated well  good compensation  clocked out at 5  good career opportunities. I then took a long vacation and did a part-time fun passion project for a bit of time. But even then  I still couldn't function or feel any excitement. I'm just overwhelmed by literally anything?

Back in my college years  I used to be a super ambitious overachiever balancing school  work  extracurriculars  social life etc. Then  everything shifted when I left school and gradually got worse over the past \~5 years. Nothing dramatic happened in my life  so I have no idea why I just can't adult anymore. Is this anxiety?

Anxiety,How I Overcame DPDR (symptoms  feedback loop  anxiety  my story  tips & advice),"Hi everyone  I really wanted to do/felt like I should make a separate master-post for how I overcame DPDR (depersonalization and derealization) that was triggered by long-term anxiety  as well as some of the symptoms  mechanisms of DPDR  feedback loop  triggers & more.

I made a previous master-post on my long-term anxiety symptoms (which I overcame) where I went over the more bizarre  rarely spoken about  constant symptoms of long-term anxiety  and the feedback loop and it seemed to help a lot of people. I will link that one below  I recommend everyone read it first!

https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/10jcfko/longterm_anxiety_symptoms_i_had_from_someone_who/

A lot of you wanted to know how I overcame the DP/DR symptoms. I didn't realise that I had message requests on Reddit  and now I've got so many spanning across months ago that I can't find the time to get back to individually so I feel like its my duty to make this post and have it all in one place. Warning  this is a big post.

Lets go over some positives first as I find its always best to get off on a positive note  and to have something to look forward to or motivate others:

**1. DP/DR (Depersonalization and Derealization) is not and is never permenant  anyone who says so are catastrophizing and are probably biased or feeling that way due to their own condition not improving. These notions are not helpful and are also not true.**

**It will and can go away 100%  it is not something you have to 'deal' with or 'accept' for the rest of your life.**


**2. DP/DR does not work like a debt system e.g. the longer you are in DP/DR  the longer it is going to take you to get out of it (isn't true!). Everyone has the same chance of success in recovering from DP/DR  no matter how long or short you have been in that state.**
**3. DP/DR is not indicative or a sign of psychosis  and you will not become psychotic if you experience DP/DR.**


DP/DR is a **defense mechanism**  which attempts to make sure that only the body experiences pain or trauma and not the mind  by causing detachment. **Causes of DP/DR can be anxiety attacks  severe stress  health anxiety  drug induced (often from edibles or hallucinogens)  traumatic first-hand or second-hand situations  abuse or any interpersonal trauma. Anyone of any age can experience DP/DR.**

.......................................................................

**What does DP/DR feel like?:**

- Everything feels (and looks) either too close or too far away from you  environments are distorted
- Everything feels flat or 2D  like it isn't quite real or tangible  others faces might feel unreal
- Can feel like the world is slipping away from you
- You might feel like you could fall over any second or fall through the floor
- Speech can feel slow/slurred  like your brain is struggling to find words
- Time can feel like its going too fast or too slow
- Feeling like you can observe yourself outside your body  everything feels disconnected  like you are very alone
- Your limbs can feel too small  too big  like you are taller or shorter than you actually are
- You might feel internally dizzy (like your mind is spinning but your vision isn't)  woozy head feelings  fuzzy head
- More frequent feelings of nostalgia/dejavu
- Colours can feel more dull or distorted
- Feeling numb  like your memories are less tangible or unreal
- Hypochondria (Healthy Anxiety) is often a huge comorbidity with DP/DR

.......................................................................

**The Feedback Loop  what is it?**

Symptoms of DP/DR (as well as Anxiety/Health Anxiety) are often kept alive by or started something called the **Feedback Loop.** This is a loop that is constantly being fed into  which could have started from something as for example:

*You may be minding your own business one day and suddenly experience a Panic Attack  but you misread it as being something worse. You could think you're about to die  that you are having a heart attack because of the palpitations  that you could collapse any moment now  and then it goes... but you're on edge  what if it happens again? Do I have a heart condition? I think I'm dying  I think something is wrong. Everyday you are waking up and checking if you can feel palpitations  you're scared it will happen again  you're getting waves of dread  your mind is full of 'what ifs' over and over again every single day. Then one day  nothing feels real and you feel completely detached from reality and this scares you even more  you feel like you're slipping away  you're terrified and feel like you'll never be normal again. You're waking up everyday to check if everything still feels unreal  and it does  its not going away. Whats happening?*


This is the **Feedback Loop** example which led to DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms. What should've happened when you experienced for example: a Panic Attack  was that **you should've been able to realise it was a Panic Attack and been able to ground yourself or calm down during that situation and it would go away. This would eliminate the start of the Feedback Loop**  but instead by misreading the situation or not having the appropriate tools to manage it  you are now in fear  in high stress and feeling traumatised of the situation in fear it will happen again or that something worse is happening to you. This keeps the Loop alive and going.

**In preparation for the pain or fear you are about to anticipate happening  your body chose to disassociate from your mind and cause DP/DR in order to handle the stress and fear of what you're afraid of experiencing. DP/DR is attempting to save you from what could happen to you next  after being activated from something that already hurt you or traumatised you.**

Identifying the first source of your DP/DR can be particularly important in understanding and learning where your Feedback Loop started. **For some people it can even extend to as far as childhood  which can sometimes result in something known as DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)**. Once you have identified the source  this is the stepping stone into recovering from DP/DR.

Sources of DPDR can be: drug-induced from hallucinogens/edibles/bad trips/alcohol or other substances  anxiety attacks  depression  stress  medical trauma/childhood trauma/adulthood trauma/being a child of divorce  sexual assaults/CSA  PTSD  DID and more

Environments are also very important to be recognised as sources of DPDR e.g. stressful jobs  stressful/abusive relationships  difficult home life  being a full-time carer for family  difficult school life etc

.......................................................................

**So what's going to help me get better?**

There's a lot of resources and therapies available for DP/DR  such as Psychotherapy (talking therapies)  CBT  DBT  EMDR and more.

But what is most important is that you are able to help yourself  as well as having professional support should you require it. **The thing that is going to get you better the most is you  and the tools you can develop to help you in time of need and in how you navigate the world and your trauma**. Some people (like me) may be able to recover from DP/DR without professional intervention or therapies  but it is always incredibly recommended if you have access or can afford it. **With DP/DR being highly trauma related  it is important to have a safe place to unload and traverse trauma with a professional**  as it can be tough to handle alone. **If you are concerned or suspect your DP/DR may be a result of DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)  professional help is absolutely necessary.**

Every person with DP/DR will be completely unique in their needs  what they can handle alone or what they need support with.

.......................................................................

**What can we do for ourselves?**

This is going to go over some self-practices and tools you can do in your own time to help yourself while actively experiencing DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms  and also how to reduce the chances of re-experiencing it when you are recovered.

**Staying Busy & Challenging Yourself:**

A big part of dissolving the Feedback Loop is by no longer feeding into it  and one way of doing this is by diverting our thoughts from the feelings of DP/DR or anxiety symptoms. **You want to find or make opportunities where you don't have time to think about DP/DR  or how it makes you feel  'scanning' for feelings or signs of it  and to challenge those feelings instead.**
**DP/DR and anxiety is the perfect time to get busy and involved with life**  whether it is your hobbies  being with your friends and family  doing chores that need to be done  starting things you've always wanted to do. **It can feel scary  even terrifying to partake in these things when you feel unreal  like you're not present or that the world is slipping away  but you must keep pushing through**. Once you begin to challenge yourself and challenge those feelings of 'not feeling real' you begin to establish trust within yourself.

**Don't be disheartened that DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms do not disappear right away overnight  this is because your body hormonally  needs time to acclimate to low levels of stress and anxiety after having been kept at such high levels. If these hormones were to plummet immediately  the body wouldn't be able to cope  so it likes to decline it gently! So consider it like you are establishing trust:**

DP/DR has been in the drivers seat all this time  and you've been the passenger in the back. You're finally insisting on being in the driver's seat  but DP/DR insists on being the passenger right next to you. DP/DR is going to freak out in the passenger seat and take the wheel from you at times during some tough situations because its not sure you can navigate it on your own  and instead of letting it take the driver's seat again you need to say to it  'Don't worry. I've got this'. and DP/DR will let go of the wheel. This in real life  would be an example of you handling the situation you are in and challenging yourself to face what makes you afraid (such as going outside in case you feel 'unreal').

**By doing this  you are establishing trust and are giving DP/DR the opportunity to know that you can handle the situation on your own. Eventually with time of practicing these things  DP/DR will get out of the car entirely and you can 'drive' all by yourself again and those feelings of DP/DR will be gone. You'll be able to live your life without things like anxiety or DP/DR dictacting where it takes you or how it makes you feel. You will have formed that trust that you can handle experiencing your pain  your fear  your trauma  your anxiety/stress etc. without the need of the defence mechanism of DP/DR. You will become the first line of defence!**

From personal experience this is what accelerated me to my complete recovery from DP/DR and long-term anxiety symptoms within 3-4 months of this practice after struggling for almost a year of non-stop DP/DR and anxiety symptoms. **I learned to empathise with my DP/DR's attempt at trying to keep me safe and acknowledged that it was only doing this in order to make me feel better  albeit in a scary and inconvenient way! So by learning techniques and also teaching myself not to be scared of DP/DR symptoms or my anxiety symptoms  I gave myself the opportunity to be the one in control and say ''Hey  I am totally capable of caring for myself now. Thank you for your help and what you tried to do for me'' to my DP/DR.**

By feeling afraid to participate in activities or doing things because you might feel unreal  or because the world feels distorted  you are allowing DP/DR to maintain control and are keeping DP/DR as an option

**Challenge yourself in incriments or in steps  and remember to reward yourself afterwards. Figure out what about DP/DR makes you afraid:**

**is it seeing people's faces? particularly friends or family?** - challenge yourself towards looking at faces  engaging with familiar faces (YouTubers  family  partners)  if you can touch their face then touch it  grounding exercises where you say ''I can see two eyes  they are [insert colour]  they have a [description] nose  do they have freckles? birth marks? do they have any smile lines? identify parts of their face and describe them'' this helps make them more tangible and less scary. Do little challenges before the bigger ones.

**is it going outside in case you feel unreal? woozy?** - challenge yourself towards small  short walks up and down your street  to eventually longer walks  acknowledge that you might be feeling dizzy/unreal but that you are safe  be kind & go home if you need it  try again another day  stay engaged with your hobbies/the outside world

**is it the feeling that you'll never be the same again? that you think its permenant? that you've ruined your life?** - The first thing you'll see if you look up 'can dpdr be permenant' is 'no!' and every other article will say no. There has never been an observed case of DPDR being permenant  and you won't be the first case of that happening. Its really important you do not entertain or engage with people who believe it is permenant  or that theirs is permenant because they are just people who are keeping their own DPDR alive with the negativity. I recommend writing positive affirmations or reading them  and engaging with positive stories of DPDR recovery and sticking with facts. **You have not ruined your life  and you will recover.**
**DPDR can make you feel afraid of lots of things  not just the ones I described above (but those are the most common).**

**Grounding Exercises:**
Grounding is a way to refocus and bring your attention back to the present and the world around you. This is can be used when experiencing fear or anxiety of your current DP/DR state  but is **most effective when you feel like it is 'coming on' or you are experiencing anxiety/stress that could lead to it.**

Grounding exercises can involve:

- Naming 5 things you can see  name 4 things you can touch and to touch them  naming 3 things you can hear and listening to them  what 2 things can you smell  1 thing you can taste.
- Holding ice cubes  putting your hands in cold water  picking up or touching things and explaining how it feels (is it cold  warm  does it feel rough or soft)  identifying their colours deeply
- Walks without music  tuning into the sounds of your steps  counting your steps  observing your surroundings on your walks  sitting in the grass and touching it.
- Mental anchoring by saying (in your head or quietly to yourself) your full name  your age  where you live  what street you live on  the date  where you are  what you're doing. Repeat this gently until you feel calm.
- Self-assurance phrases such as  ''You are okay''  ''Nothing can hurt me''  ''You will get through this''  ''I've done this once and I can do it again'' etc.

.......................................................................

**My Example of How I Personally Recovered from DPDR:**

For me I dealt with a lot of wooziness/dizziness during my DP/DR and I felt terrified to do anything sitting up or standing because I'd have to acknowledge that dizzy feeling and the unreal-ness from DP/DR  so I would lie on my side all day while watching TV or playing games instead to cope. **I wanted to turn 'Oh god  no I'm dizzy and woozy and nothing feels real  I'm so scared' into 'Oh I'm dizzy and feel unreal today? Lets see what I can manage'.**

It started to become more of 'Let's get up! Lets engage with the same hobbies but lets sit up this time'. I'd do that for as long as I feel I could handle the dizzines and unreal sensations  and then I'd lie back down again. I rewarded myself and cared for myself with a technique that brought me comfort  while having succeeded in engaging with something that scared me or was difficult. Over time I'd start to sit up for longer  or I'd start to go outside on short walks (which was particularly hard as I'd feel more unreal outside than at home)  and I would feel unreal  like everything was flat  like the world was slipping away but I did it.

Some days I would just cry or feel like I took steps back  that I'd be stuck forever but I kept going and I kept rewarding myself after those times with either little lie downs  eating things I really loved  engaging in self-care or watching familiar TV shows I know I loved. Over time I started to sit up a lot more  I started to stand more  I started to go out more and for much  much longer each time  I started to do all the things I loved again despite how I felt. **Don't get me wrong  I still felt unreal and dizzy but I wanted to stop being scared of it and to not let it stop me engaging with things I loved or wanted to do.**

**I stopped basing my days and thoughts on 'how good I'm feeling' and more so on 'how well can I manage today'.** That took away a lot of pressure for me  as I knew I would not feel better over night but I would learn to manage my days better  so focusing on that intrinsically helped me feel better. You'll want to learn how to manage bad days (whether DPDR days  anxious days  stressful days) because when you do  you'll become prepared for if you ever face any of those times again and you can conquer it!

One day after months of challenging myself  being more present  doing my hobbies  going outside (I remember this vividly) I was hugging my partner and I looked up at his face and I physically jumped  **he looked real. I started looking around everywhere and everything felt real  everything looked so colorful  the world didn't feel flat or distorted  everything felt 'real' and 'right' and when I touched my partner's face it felt so tangible and real.** I don't think I've ever cried that hard in my life from happiness  my DPDR was gone.

Everything probably felt like this for a while  but because I was so engrossed in engaging with the world around me and doing the things I loved I didn't actually realise it  because I was no longer questioning my reality or looking for signs of DP/DR. **So that one moment where I finally remembered to 'check' my reality  it made me realise everything felt real again and that I felt human again. And it never came back.**

When you feel ready  the key is to be kind to yourself as well as challenge yourself against your DPDR and how it makes you feel. By pushing through and engaging with the world around you bit by bit you will start to establish that trust  those tools  in convincing your body that you can handle yourself and that it no longer needs to detach with DPDR to keep you safe.

.......................................................................

**Some habits to get into  and some to get rid of:**

- **Cut out all alcohol and all drugs absolutely and completely  as well as caffeine & reduce or quit smoking.** All of these substances will have an effect on the hormones in your body  and can impede progress from DP/DR due to the sensations it can produce and will generally stress out the body  and mind-altering drugs like hallucinogens or Cannabis can worsen DP/DR greatly or keep it around. *If you are an addict or suffer from addictions  get in touch with services that can help you taper  detox or navigate potential sobriety  do not attempt any of this alone.*

- **Establish a normal bedtime routine**  ideally getting into bed at 9-10pm and waking up before 9am. Some people need more sleep than others so wake up at whatever time in the morning before 9am is best for you; getting adequate sleep will greatly improve the rate of which your DP/DR can dissolve as your mind will be most lucid  alert and prepared to handle potential stressors. **Sleeping too much or too little can greatly affect your brain and hormone regulation  and you need the best hormone regulation in order for the body to lower cortisol levels which leads to DP/DR symptoms rapidly improving.**

- **Stay hydrated and well-fed.** This is really typical mental health advice  but in general you will want to make sure you are hydrated and well-fed so the body has enough energy supply to handle stressors  anxiety and to ensure the mind is as lucid and energised as possible. You will need all the energy you can possibly get  and having these bases covered can really improve your symptoms.

- **Get checked for any Vitamin Deficiencies** as a lot of Vitamins we can be deficient in will greatly effect circadian rhythms  heart rhythms  the brain (deficiencies can cause brain fog  low motor skill function and poor hormone regulation). **Making sure we have healthy  functioning foundations to work off of greatly supports mental function and our ability to take on new information and learn new things (such as therapeutic tools and treatment).**

- **Identify your stressors and reduce them  identify your triggers and navigate them.** Cortisol levels increase with stress (from stressors) and anxiety  when we are faced with high levels of cortisol for extended periods of time  the body can produce bizzare and scary symptoms (which are harmless).

But the two things getting me the most are A.I and Climate Change. 

Starting with A.I because it's something ""small"". I want to be a writer. I've always dreamt about writing stories  and have done it since I was a kid. I just didn't have any personal big project like I have now.  
The thing is  with A.I there  the way society works and treats artits are changing so much. I just feel like I can keep with the changes.

But that's it about A.I. It's just personal.

The thing that's getting me the most right now  it's Climate Change  and it's impacts. Not only we're watching our society changing  but the world it's going trough it too. And for the worst!   
Life will only get harder. I live in a poor country  which probably can/will be very affected by it (The whole world will).

But now  I just feel so weak and fragile. To the point I regret quitting. 

I have a story that I would love to write. But it just feels so meaningless... We need to change the way we live  but we're not doing it. And when we're forced to  things will be hard. Even harder than they are right now. I just don't know what to do.

Anxiety,BREAKING NEWS! Your Life Is Meaningless.,"Let me be the first one to say that  what I’m about to say  I’m not the first one to say. Countless others from philosophers and poets  kings to shepherds  and freemen to prisoners  all have reached one singular grave and paralyzing conclusion: this life is meaningless. There’s nothing new about that statement  nothing groundbreaking  nothing Nobel-prize winning.

So how do I know this? Where does this meaninglessness come from? The temporal significance of all that we are and of all that we do. Your life’s significance is a function of time. I don’t care if you’re Alexander the Great  Marilyn Monroe  Bob Saget  or Joseph of Arimathea  with enough time transpired all that you’ve done  all your hopes  aspirations and efforts will amount to ultimately nothing. Humanity is but a temporary moment in the cosmos. The time will come when either nature annihilates us or we destroy ourselves. Either way we’re done for. It is simply just a matter of time until it will be as if we were never here. Again  there’s nothing new about this  although most folks choose to ignore this pervasive fact and bury their heads in the sand.

Furthermore  not only is humanity a temporary institution on the macro level  but the very individuals that constitute humanity are temporary beings as well. As you read this recognize that the very feelings of consciousness which enable you to perceive the words in front of you and serve as the common denominator for all that you experience is a temporary phenomenon. There will soon be a day when you don’t “you” anymore.

“Very well then ” says the nihilist. “What’s wrong with that?” Agreed. Some may find comfort in their temporality  even going so far as to utilize it as a reminder not to become too engrossed in the requirements of day-to-day life. The problem arises for me when one must rationalize the suffering that day-to-day life requires. “Suffering? What suffering? Your hunter-gatherer ancestors endured suffering. What could you possibly qualify as suffering in your day-to-day experience?” Again  I agree. When one thinks of suffering the first thoughts to come to mind aren’t exactly the nine-to-five  40 to 50 hour work week that many of us exemplify. But what is a life in its entirety aside from a spectrum of highs and lows? A roller coaster if you will  with a majority of its time spent somewhere in the middle. I think it would be fair to say that most of one’s life is spent steeped in mediocrity  not overtly pleasurable but also not necessarily painful. Now consider for the moment the fact that we are purpose driven creatures and juxtapose that with the aforementioned proposition that this life is meaningless. What possible rationale can one conjure to persist through this mediocre existence?

Recognizing the ultimate temporality of all that we do whether internally (via consciousness) or externally (via humanity) we can conclude that our existence is ultimately meaningless and that the suffering that one must endure to exist is irrational. Knowing this  what shall we do? Persist through an existence that we fool ourselves into thinking is significant? Toss ourselves off a cliff? Join the Seminary? To be honest  there is nothing you can do. The consciousness that serves as the basis for your being will soon enough cease to be. The body in which your consciousness resides will one day return to the earth. And the earth to which your body returns will one day turn to cosmic ash  taking with it all that was ever human. An ancient Persian king once asked a collection of wise men to formulate a mantra which would always be applicable and in all ways true. After much deliberation the wise men could return but one: “And This Too Shall Pass.”

TL;DR: ""Recognizing the ultimate temporality of all that we do whether internally (via consciousness) or externally (via humanity) we can conclude that our existence is ultimately meaningless and that the suffering that one must endure to exist is irrational.""",0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2qabyl/breaking_news_your_life_is_meaningless/
Anxiety,Anxiety is ruining my life :( ,"So I’m a 25y/o female.
work full-time at 80k a year  have a beautiful house  a beautiful girlfriend  two awesome dogs. I have everything a person should be thankful for right? 

I WISH! 

I have extremely bad anxiety. A lot of different types. Health anxiety is the most consuming  I spend most of my days saying to my girlfriend 
“Am I having a heart attack?”
“Am I having a stroke?” “Are you sure  is my smile even?” 
“Am I okay?”
“Am I crazy?” 
The list truly goes on and on… it’s exhausting and it’s scary to live like this. When I have something cleared by a doctor  I 
a) am scared they missed it 
Or b) move on to the next fear. 

The other terrible thing I deal with is 
Dissociation. I constantly live in a state of feeling like “everything isn’t real”. Everything I do feels staged and corny. Like I can’t enjoy any moments. My girlfriend and I used to have so much fun now I obsess over whether or not I’m a character in a video game while we do ANYTHING… then I spiral into a panic attack because I just feel so “unreal….” 

This is completely ruining my life. I’m out of options  it’s been a slow burn but lately it’s gotten so bad my saint of a girlfriend seems tired of me. Tired of me asking. Tired of me being crazy. It’s embarrassing and hurtful. I want to look forward to the weekends  the holidays  all the happy stuff again! It all seems pointless and meaningless. I want my life back. 

At this point  I’m just convinced I have a brain tumor. 

If you have any life questions for me that might help you understand me  or my brain please comment! Im an open book! Desperate for help. 

If anybody has any tips  advice  similar experiences please share. I would love any feedback at all.

Anxiety,How to deal with it?2,"The thought of losing someone who feels just like you  someone you've searched for since childhood is terrifying. Now that you’ve found them  you fear they might walk away  not because they want to  but because life has exhausted them. Soon  distance will separate you  and the anxiety of losing them makes it hard to breathe. They are your hope  the reason you keep going  and the thought of them giving up feels unbearable.

I'll never lose my partner  and I've made a promise to him that no matter how bad our anxiety gets  I'll hold onto him because life will be meaningless without him by my side. 

But deep down  the anxiety keeps eating you up  how to deal with that and keep them close to you?

(We both are super anxious  but we love each other more than anything else  we've survived through similar hardships together and I firmly believe that we're going to get through this one too  but our anxiety has worsen over the years due to childhood trauma and other incidents  it somewhat takes a toll on our mental as well as physical health) ",1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1im0q0l/how_to_deal_with_it2/
Anxiety,How to deal with your gf being gone ?,"
My girlfriend passed away at the age of 24. She was 3 years older than me. We were supposed to be married in 2026   by that time I would have got my bachelor’s degree and made money to buy a house so we can live in together . On the last 21st of September her father called me to tell me that she died   for me not only her that is left but the whole word left me. I grieved and I was broken hearted  tried to accept that every single one of us will die someday. I tried to pursue my life as I was doing before she is gone but literally everything now seems meaningless for me  I stopped at some point and I can’t move forward from it . I can’t play music or watch a movie or scroll in the mobile i feel nothing but empty. I wake up   scroll in the mobile then get bored then I leave the mobile and lay on the bed trying to get some sleep (however i just woke up) and I fall asleep. I try to get some sleep as much as possible so i can see her in my dreams but this has affected me as I’m sleeping 16-17 hours per day (add to this that there was a day i slept 22 hours and a half) and I can’t control my sleep now as if I became an addict to sleep. It’s hard to move from this especially when you have no friends to talk to them (she was the only one I have in my life). I don’t know what to do and don’t know what I want but the only thing I want is sleep because it will help me either to stop thinking or to see her in my dreams. 
Sometimes I wish that all of her memories to go away from my head. I don’t want to remember anything connected to her just to not grieve on her anymore  is that a good way of thinking of her ?",30,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1fs5rrx/how_to_deal_with_your_gf_being_gone/
Anxiety,Took 2 pills of Zoloft and stopped cold. Now I’m in an existential crisis,"Hello everyone 

Looking for advice.

Basically I decided to do something about my anxiety and went to a doctor  they recommended Zoloft. I took a 50 mg pill 2 days in a row and wow was that the worst decision of my life. I had crazy side effects  I won’t list them all mainly heightened anxiety and paranoia but I stopped cold turkey after 2 days. 

The worst was my intrusive thoughts went wild. I’ve always had a fear of death where a lot of my anxiety comes from  you know my chest gets tight and I think I’m dying from a heart attack. This is different though  I’m thinking about how death is inevitable and how life is meaningless  it’s terrifying me. It’s been about a week since I stopped. My question is will this stop or has stopping cold just brought on more anxiety that won’t go away. It’s been about a week since I stopped.

Anxiety,Bad Anxiety. Please help me.,Please help. Ever since I was very young  I’ve been pretty anxious. I was always anxious about many things  like going out to cities or getting on the train etc. However  it’s always been manageable and hardly affected me. When I was like 16 years old  I got into drinking and smoking weed from time to time with my friends  as most stupid 16 year olds do. It was great and I loved it  and I would only smoke weed like once a month maybe. I would always wake up feeling fine  and get on with my day. However  when I was 17  I was ill but still had an edible with my friends. Everything was normal  until I woke up the next morning. I felt terrible. I felt foggy and almost in a dream-like state. Obviously  I panicked because this was horrible and I was terrified that I would feel like this forever. Eventually  I felt normal and fine again once I recovered from my illness  but everytime after this point  I would feel in this foggy  dream-like state for the next day after smoking weed. This put me off weed  which was unfortunate but it wasn’t the end of the world. A few months later  and I’m the happiest I’ve ever been  until suddenly a friend passes away and my girlfriend cheats on me  during the most important  and stressful exams of my life. A horrible month or two  but I get through it. Me and my friends go out to celebrate at the pub  and she’s there with her new man. Quite drunk  I popped a nicotine patch in  but it was too strong  so next thing  I’m throwing up in the toilet. I started panicking that she would find out that I’m throwing up  because that’s embarrassing. Not sure if it was a panic attack or not  but I can’t really remember it that well. However  the next morning when I wake up  all is fine  until suddenly this foggy  dream-like state  mentioned beforehand  washes over me. But this time  I panicked  because usually this feeling that I get from smoking weed disappears once the weed has left my system  but in this situation  there’s nothing like that to leave my system  so now I really panic about this never going away. Everyday I would wake up  wondering if I felt any better  and everyday it would just get worse  or stay the same. It’s now been about a year since then  and the feeling is still here. I’ve been learning to live with my situation  but it’s still terrible. I’m at university  and I can’t even have stimulants and things  like alcohol  nicotine  weed  caffeine  because after consuming these things  I feel way worse while doing so  until it kicks in hard  and then I feel absolutely terrible a few days after. Not like a hangover type of terrible  because I have hardly ever had hangovers before. But like a  I feel so out of it type of terrible. I also can’t do many random things anymore that make me feel awful  like wearing headphones  watching TV etc. I hate going back home from university  because being at home makes the feeling much worse  because I was at home for so long feeling like this  that now whenever I go back it just reminds me of it all. Only my parents know  so being around them also makes me feel worse  which sucks so badly. However  one of the main reasons why I hate this feeling is because I feel like I can’t be myself. I guess I’ve always kind of been the ‘funny’ and ‘witty’ guy  but I feel like I can hardly even think half the time  and that I’m just kind of sitting there blankly. Although this probably isn’t true  it’s how I feel  and the last few months my social anxiety has been awful. I hate talking to people  because what if I’m not funny enough  or interesting enough  or what if I’m too monotone and boring? I haven’t made many friends at university  and I miss having a girlfriend  but I just feel like I can’t do these things anymore because I just feel awful and anxious all the time. How could I have a girlfriend  because I’d constantly be thinking about if I’m funny enough  or kind enough  or interesting enough  which is what happens in my head when talking to literally ANYONE  even my own best friends which I’ve known for years  and even my own family. I love making youtube videos  and I’ve even built up a pretty large following over the years  but now I can’t even make youtube videos anymore  because whenever I try to game and talk  I just can’t do it. I’m constantly thinking about what I’m saying  and talking doesn’t even feel natural anymore. I’m overthinking every little thing I say in every interaction  real life or online. Now I just officially feel stuck. I have felt little to no happiness in my life since this all started. I don’t get excited for anything anymore  because I know I’m just going to be overthinking everything. I can’t play games with my friends online  I can’t make youtube videos  I can’t drink  smoke  I can’t ever enjoy myself in any situation without overthinking everything  and I’ve lost all motivation in life. I’ve always wanted to be successful and rich. I’ve always known inside that it was going to happen  but recently  I’ve lost all drive and ambition. Life feels meaningless. I can’t even do the things I enjoy anymore. Pretty much every second of my life is miserable. Every now and again  I do have those moments of clarity  where I think  “I’m okay  I feel good” for about 5 minutes max  before I start thinking about how quickly it’s going to take before I feel terrible again  which causes me to feel terrible. I can’t take this anymore  and this can’t be the rest of my life. I’ve tried many things. Therapy  CBT  walks  exercise  drinking lots of water  eating well  getting enough sleep  vitamins  going outside  everything. Some stuff helps slightly  but I just want to be a normal  relatively stress-free normal teenager again. I am so jealous of all my friends who can go out partying  drinking  doing drugs etc  while I go out and overthink all night  and get called boring by my friends because I don’t smoke anymore  but they just don’t understand. At first I thought it was DPDR  but the symptoms didn’t really match  and my therapist said that it is just anxiety. I think it’s just general anxiety about everything. I need help  please. I just want to be able to get drunk and have a cigarette  and smoke weed from time to time  and talk to people without constantly worrying  and make youtube videos and be successful etc. Thank you for reading this. It means a lot.,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1j1i0of/bad_anxiety_please_help_me/
Anxiety,i literally overthink everything and im so tired of it,"i don’t have an anxiety diagnosis  nor have i even paid attention to my potential symptoms until a month ago maybe  but i’ve definitely had a lot of traits my whole life.

regardless  i overthink literally every decision. i’ll research and research every product no matter how cheap or unimportant the item to make sure im getting the utmost value and quality  and i will easily spend over 4 hours a night doing this shit. i overthink what songs to play when i shower  what youtube video will perfectly suit the meal im eating. i overthink a lot about cooking: is the recipe im using even good? lemme check the reviews. oh but i cant trust these reviews bc there’s only 15. lemme see others  ok this recipe looks really good but wait am i doing this right wait i need to research this  what if it doesn’t taste good? if i cut it too thick doesn’t that mess up all the timing and the texture will be wrong  what if i get sick from it being raw? is it overcooked? is generally my line of thinking and trying a new recipe isn’t just a Oh let’s do this on whim! thing  it’s more a careful and calculated but stressful deliberation that takes an hour to decide on. i also overthink gardening a lot and stresses me out wondering if im not growing my plants to their potential or stunting their growth unknowingly so i research tf out of it. 

the absolute worst is thinking about my college major. i have so many options and i can’t choose a single one bc as soon as i think im set  i second guess  i doubt  and i see that the grass mighttt just be greener on the other side. i can never actually be comfortable with my decision  and im terrified i will always live unhappy because i keep comparing myself. because college decisions are coming out  ive been leading myself into repeated panic attacks each time a college i applied to with a different major than the others accepts me  because now i dont know what to choose. sometimes i wish choices were just made for me. 

i also overthink my appearance  behavior  and personality a LOT and living like this feels like being in hell  seriously.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1anzdxf/i_literally_overthink_everything_and_im_so_tired/
Anxiety,I don't understand how people work 40+ hours a week for 45+ years of their lives,"I (23f) am American. I don't know if it is just me  but I am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until I can finally afford to retire (if that ever happens). My current job isn't hard  but it sucks the life out of me. Every weekend is too short  and every work week is too long. I never feel like I am rested enough or that I have enough time to do the fun things I like to do. I don't feel like I have hobbies anymore  and I certainly don't have very many friends. I feel like I have to spend all of my ""free time"" keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week.

I don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives  and I especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. I think of all the things I want out of life  including children  traveling  homeownership  and everything else that comes with that  and I don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. I don't even make enough money to do those things  much less have the vacation time. I'm working on budgeting and building my savings  but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. I promised myself I would see Europe before I hit 25 and I don't think that's a realistic goal anymore.

I get stuck in this spiral of ""am I just lazy"" and start to get worried that it is only me. Maybe  somehow  I am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. Sometimes I feel ungrateful. My life is fine - I have a roof over my head and food to eat. I am privileged in terms of the type I work I do. Sure  it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing  but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. That's better than a lot of people can say. 

Can someone tell me it isn't just me? Or maybe give me a reality check that it is? I just don't know how I can keep this up for another 45 years. I'm so tired.

Edit: I've taken some time to go through all the comments (though I didn't expect so many) and have really appreciated a lot of the advice i've been given! It's great to feel not as alone in this discomfort  and I think I have some ideas and goals on how to improve my situation in this new year.

Anxiety,I'm tired of everything just being my anxiety,"So I recently went and did some autism screening stuff but what came back in the results was that the ""autism symptoms were caused severe anxiety."" 

I feel like I'm not being taken seriously and that every health and mean to health professional sees I have very high anxiety and it's ALWAYS that. 

I've been ridiculed by medical professionals at ERs and Urgent Cares  they said nothing was wrong with me when I literally did have a health problem and I was just pushed away because I had anxiety that was unmedicated at the time. 

I'm so so tired of everything being my anxiety because genuinely I feel like there's more too it  maybe it's autism or maybe it's something else but it's not just all anxiety and Im sick of everyone saying it is.

I am sick and tired of NEVER being taken seriously and everything being dulled down to my anxiety  like yeah I have anxiety and it is a lot but that's not all I have or am. It constantly feels so invalidating for everything to be my anxiety  it makes me feel like that's all there is too me.",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/vdcvkc/im_tired_of_everything_just_being_my_anxiety/
Anxiety,How I Beat my Anxiety Disorder and Advice on How to do so Yourself,"So if you’re reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder  let me start by saying I know how you feel. I’ve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don’t stop  I’ve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end  I’ve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water  had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I’ve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I’ve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times  I’ve had racing  intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I’ve felt like I was going crazy. A lot.

But I’m here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort  all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I’ll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks  but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn’t really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .

So I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety  mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you’re at  scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.

I don’t discuss responses to specific symptoms here  just a general approach. If you’re looking for tactics for specific symptoms  check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom  but you can try the third if you don’t feel it makes enough of a difference.

Before you read  I want to mention something once so I don’t have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you’ll feel like you made incredible progress  and others you’ll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It’s going to be a lot of two steps forward  one step back. Sometimes it’ll even be two steps forward  two steps back. But even those times are okay  because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort  things will start gradually getting better.

So here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.

If you’re at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can’t calm down:

At this stage  you’re either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I’ve had maaaaaany panic attacks  so I know this advice will work for both.

**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:

* Don’t try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first  but with practice you’ll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes  I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms  the more worried you become  which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones  causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. 

* Questions  doubts  and fear will come up. When they do  remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through  and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult  but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.

* If this isn’t working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won’t stop  ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it  run towards your symptoms. If you’ve ever read a book on ACT  this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse  you’ll find it can’t. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry  and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease  then move on to step 2. In case you’re interested  the clinical term for this is “arousal reappraisal.” It’s not discussed very often  but I found it to be very helpful. 

**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment  this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic  but in The DARE Response  Barry McDonagh calls it being “engaged.” This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you’re at  this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it  so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again  MUCH easier said than done  and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it’s an integral part of recovery. When I first started out  I found short activities the most helpful  like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two  or doing homework. 

**3.** Give it time. Your system can’t sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you’ll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.

**4.** If recommended by your physician  a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants  but they’re no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium  I didn’t feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning  but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term  and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo  you’ll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point  you’re in a constant state of panic  they’re a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety  so you can start focusing on the long term.

**5.** Journal. I don’t recommend this as much beyond this stage  as I’ve found it doesn’t really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD  I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you’re thinking or feeling. It’s a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.

**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block  take a stretch break at work. You don’t need to be doing a full workout at this point  just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you’re getting for something productive.

**7.** This one may seem rather minor  but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It’s much easier to feel short of breath when you’re in a position that doesn’t let you breath easily. If you’re lying down  lay on your back. If you’re sitting  sit up straight.

Once you’ve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks)  you can move on to the next step.

Constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:

If you’re at this phase  you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety  like jitters  nausea  jelly legs  shortness of breath  and so on. But you’re not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time  you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here’s what to do at this stage:

**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you’re going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what’s going on in your brain and body  the better you’ll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they’ll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end  this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you’re knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal  you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact  I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety  the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized  but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible  which is how I consumed them):

* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who’s been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you’re at the higher end of the anxiety scale.

* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It’s aimed at treating depression  but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing  then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It’s long  so I don’t think you need to do the first part  but there’s a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.

* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT  1/4 lifestyle guidance  and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do  and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.

* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before  and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren’t worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as “an incurable disease” in this book. He’s not a doctor or therapist and isn’t really knowledgeable on the subject  so I’d take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.
Remember  the point of these books isn’t to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.

**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety  and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with  you’ll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:

* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you’re saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?

* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring  but he didn’t know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics  like square breathing. 

* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?
It may take a while until you find a therapist who’s right for you  but this is a person you’ll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. 

**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms  the more quickly they’ll dissipate. In addition  if you can  start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you’re taking it three times a day  try to move down to two. If you’re down to two a day  try one.

**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:

* Cardiovascular exercise. It’s said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you’re anxious  but I’d like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you’re anxious  your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don’t dump it out somehow  the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you’re not super exercise savvy  my suggestion is to get out and walk  jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy  but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don’t need to do sprints whenever you run  but you’ll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.

* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you’re having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind  the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact  it’s almost the opposite. While meditating  your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds  and you’re just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate  and it includes helpful techniques like noting  so I won’t go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first  then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.

* Diet. If you’re reading this  you’ve probably read the do’s and don’ts of your diet about a hundred times  but I’ll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine  no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods  and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation  though the research isn’t entirely there yet. Regardless  try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I’ll defer to the DARE Response for information about it)  though again  research is shaky so this alone won’t bring change. 

* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor’s discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants  some don’t. I didn’t feel like they helped me all that much  but you might. Note  the purpose of antidepressants isn’t to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won’t change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.

**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn’t change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.

Once you’ve been at these things for a while  you’ll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.

Hovering around 4 - 6:

If you’re at this stage  congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of  and if you did  it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you’ve reached this stage  your anxiety likely doesn’t manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally  but most of the time you’re able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You’ve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you’re still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition  though your physical symptoms may have eased up  your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here’s what you should do at this stage:

**1.** Keep staying the course. It’s easy to flounder or stop  and it’s okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also  don’t beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time  it’s part of what makes us human. And it’s okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work  things will get better.

**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you’ve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I’d find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this  I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations  but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up  and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren’t meant to be fun**. If you’ve got social anxiety and you’re challenging yourself by going to meet new people  it’ll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you’ll slowly notice improvement  and with time  it’ll become more and more natural over time.

**3.** Along the same lines  start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer  lift heavier weights. When you’re anxious  you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life  sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of “I’ve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two  why aren’t I seeing my anxiety improve?” And the answer in this case is because this person wasn’t pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things  you shouldn’t expect to see improvement.

**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included)  this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It’s okay to cave every once in a while at this stage  but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety  which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year  and my condition got much better as a result. If you’re seriously concerned about something  visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them  but once they diagnose you  do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types  sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find  but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you’re constantly sick or dying  yet doctors can’t find anything wrong  this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good)  but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn’t mean it’s true. 

**5.** Give it time. I’ve said it before but it’s important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months  so try your best to be patient. And remember  if things aren’t the way you want them to be now  they will be soon.

I think it’s also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**  which you may have come across in your book reading  as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience  but since that’s kind of vague  I’ll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words  you’re using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you’re someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself “that conversation was so awkward  so that person must think I’m a loser.” In this case  whether or not the situation was awkward  you don’t know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn’t see me that way  and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.

At this stage  I had the most trouble with mental symptoms  namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations  I always second guessed my own sanity  I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia  and anytime I was happy  I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy  so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you  it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist  therapists  family  and friends are correct when they say you’re not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety  or that you’re the one person out of the fifty who’s somehow figured out you’re losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn’t make it true**.

One of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery  it’s absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied  especially when you’re most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same  as they’re both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually  your mind will calm down on its own and you’ll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time  I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm  this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from  but once I did  I hit the next stage.

Anxiety is 1 - 3 most days  with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:

You’re in the home stretch. This is it. You’re likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you’ve done  but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you’ve come. For me  having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I’d ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously  if you’ve hit this point  the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it’s a little harder to deal with  let me reassure you: you’re almost home free.

Note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come  sometimes you’ll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack  but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don’t last more than a few seconds  and your symptoms don’t really illicit a response from you. At this stage:

**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you’ve clearly demonstrated they work. All that’s left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4  remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you’ll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. 

**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends  stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you’re still occasionally taking benzos  slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back  the more confident you’ll feel.

**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you’ve had anxiety and use what you’ve learned to stop worrying. For me  this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding  and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you’re able to ease  the better you’ll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would’ve never been able to do.

There really isn’t much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement  remind yourself of how well you’ve done so far and that there’s more to come.

Then finally…

No anxiety  with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:

That’s it. All the voices in your head telling you you’re not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don’t really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days  but most of the time you’re energetic  present  and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you’ve never had. It’s been a few months since you’ve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while  but you’re not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens  and that they’ll go away just as quickly as they came.

I don’t have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you’ll keep on doing it. 

Congratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.
_

My therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do  do the opposite. If it’s telling you not to get out of bed  do it. If it’s telling you not to go to a social event  do that. If it’s telling you you’re going to suffer from some grave illness  remind yourself that’s not true. If it’s telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help  don’t. If it’s telling you you’re losing your mind  remind yourself you’re not. Give it enough time  and eventually things will get better. 

**Summary:**

**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it’s just anxiety and can’t do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You’ve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**

**Don’t fight it. When you fight your anxiety  it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**

**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety  googling your symptoms  posting on this subreddit  writing in your journal  or just stewing in general  the worse off you’ll be. Cook  clean  dance  exercise  paint  draw  do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**

**Keep pushing the bounds of what you’re doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you’ve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it’ll only benefit you in the end.**

**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn’t make it true. You’ll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you’ve been dreading isn’t half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**

**Give it time. You’ll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**

Thank you for reading this. I really hope that  no matter where you’re at in life  you gained something from this. Please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful  or if there’s anything you want me to expand upon. I’ll try to respond to comments as best I can  but I work full time and don’t log into this account all that much  so I’m sorry if I don’t get to your comment as quickly as you’d like.

Edit: Sorry if the formatting is a little funky. 

Edit 2: Thank you guys for the overwhelmingly positive response! I've read all of your comments and am super happy ya'll found this helpful. I want to remind all of you who are currently going through bouts of anxiety that you absolutely will make it through and that you'll be a much better person for it. 

Keep in mind: anxiety does not define you. An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder  you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories  however small  you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make.

Good luck guys :)

Anxiety,i need to rant to fellow christians,i’m so tired of hearing people say i’m demon possessed for having anxiety. i am a christian and i’ve prayed for years and years for God to help me with my anxiety and i’ve tried to give my fears over to him for 8 years. i’m tired of seeing christian people post that i’ve not had enough faith or i have sin in my life and that’s why im not delivered from anxiety. i am not demon possessed and i haven’t failed in any way to where God won’t take this from me. i’m just feeling really upset right now that people continue to spread this logic without knowing the people who struggle with anxiety so bad and have prayed for years and done everything to make it go away. it’s not that easy to just “don’t fear” because God tells me not to. i try not to. ,38,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ivrgzv/i_need_to_rant_to_fellow_christians/

Anxiety,I know nobody cares but..,"I have been having horrible days  everyday I feel like I'm dying. Therapist and psychiatrists are not helping. I have this happy face around my loved ones at all times because they don't understand and bother with my condition.
I'm just so so done with this life  even something as simple as going to work is challenging. 

Today I was eating during lunch at work and felt dizzy as I looked up  always feel like a dizzy/buzzy feeling inside my head no matter how I sleep or not because my sleep is not restorative or deep. I thought anxiety medications would curb it but no  it went for a few days now back again..I had to run back home for the 3rd time this week thinking I'm going to fall and lose consciousness.

I'm frustrated and just don't want to continue like this anymore ",4,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1g6jl1c/i_know_nobody_cares_but/
Anxiety,I feel like nobody genuinely cares about me or having me around,"I know a decent amount of people  but I don’t feel like I’m connected to a lot of them. I have a small group of friends that I absolutely love  I just feel a lot of the times latley nobody has the time or energy for me. I know we all get busy or have things in life that we need to take care of but it just seems like NOBODY has the time or wants to do anything when I ask. 

I think this has been a lot harder for being recently because I used to hang out with my roommate a ton  she is my best friend and like my other half. I know that she’s been going through some stuff herself  but we live together and I rarely see her. Lately I’ve been asking her to do things with me because I know we are both off  and she will just ignore me or not answer. I think recently  I’ve just been a lot more hurt about it because she has some new friends that she’s been hanging out with. I’m not even bothered by the new friends  but even just a response I’m busy with some other people tonight would be so so nice. 

I just feel like I am a person that has a lot of care and wants to give a lot to people and have good connections  I just don’t feel like anything is too deep nowadays. I still value these people a lot and I still care about them  I just don’t think it’s being reciprocated at all almost. I know that there are people that do care and it’s not like I’m trying to take away from any of that. But it’s really hard putting so much value on people to feel like nobody’s in your corner.

I want people in my life that I feel like genuinely want me around and genuinely care about me and how I’m doing . Having people that don’t even take the time to hang out get together  or let alone just have simple conversations just don’t have meaning. I don’t know. I feel like there is many aspects to the situation and I could just go on about it forever.

Anxiety,A bad THC trip has left me with permanent anxiety; or  a warning for people with anxiety to not underestimate edibles,"#Long post warning. TL;DR I had a nightmare edible trip a few years ago and it seems to have permanently affected the way I react to weed and increased my daily general anxiety. Looking for similar experiences  hoping for some explanation or a happy ending.


Title says it all. This incident happened about two years ago. Here's what I can remember from the trip:

Background: I smoked a lot on and off since I was in my late teens (now in my 30s). Had a brief period of hard drug use  then my wife helped me clean up my act and my life has been pretty sweet and my overall anxiety had been quite low - for the past few years  I haven't had anything stronger than a beer and some weed and generally that was fine until this incident happened. I never  ever in my life had any sort of weed-induced anxiety save for one time in high school when we got chased by the cops through a park while stoned  but an hour later we were just laughing about the experience. I do have general and social anxiety disorder but weed never amplified that  in fact it was always the opposite where weed would calm me down and mellow me out. It was like a miracle drug. I never got stuck in my own head or anything like that until this happened. This is important to note: for the months leading up to this incident  I stopped smoking daily to focus on work  usually only getting stoned on the weekends. So my tolerance had dropped.


Drove into the city to see a movie. Hanging around outside beforehand  I took two edibles 20 minutes apart  each of which contained roughly 2g of some dispensary shit that had been mailed in to our state. They were peanut butter firecrackers. I completely fucked up the dosage and accidentally put in about ten times as much as I intended (I'm bad at math). That was my first mistake. I did not take into account the fact that I had a lower tolerance and just wanted to get ripped. So I gobbled them down and the die was cast. Someone I talked to estimated that I ingested at least 800mg of TCH. For reference  I think the dosage of most edibles these days for normal people hover around 10mg.

About 35 min later  we were sitting in the theater when the first one kicked in almost all at once. For about 3 minutes  I was giggling and feeling good. Then I realized I was way more stoned than I expected  it was kicking in too fast  my heart was thumping  and the second one hadn't kicked in yet. So the anticipation of how much higher I was about to get started to make me uncomfortable. My only thought was the second one hasn't kicked in yet  it hasn't kicked in yet  holy shit this is going to be a lot. My hands began to tingle and I got lightheaded and all of a sudden my heartbeat and breathing seemed way too loud to be normal.

I tried to calm myself by telling myself that I was in a movie theater and all I had to do was sit and distract myself with the movie  and that was when the paranoia started. I felt like everyone behind us was watching me. I started breathing really quickly and I was just about to lean over and tell my wife when the second one kicked in.

Just like the first one  the second edible hit me in the head all at once like a hammer. I blasted off. For a moment  all I could do was grip the arm rests as tightly as I could and wheeze through my nose  trying to control my breathing. I started drooling and sort of foaming at the mouth like a dog. My vision exploded into a kaleidoscope of color but they weren't pleasant colors  they were hostile and unnatural alien ones that only served to reinforce the idea that I was not in a comfortable and natural place. I felt like a space monkey locked in some hateful alien zoo. The small rounded lights on the walkways seemed to me like eyes which were staring furiously at me. I lost the ability to hear things and all I could sense out of my ears was a low  deep evil droning like a ship's foghorn. I covered my ears but it didn't help so I started shaking my head furiously  whispering no  no  no. At this point my wife looked over at me to see wtf I was doing and she saw that I was tripping out. She whispered something to me but I couldn't hear her because I had lost my ability to hear or discern human words. Her voice made no sounds but her teeth scared the shit out of me. They looked like the angry teeth of a shark. She rubbed my hand and noticed I was sweating bullets.

This was the last point where I noticed anything about the movie. I sat in there for 20 or so more minutes but despite watching the screen I had no idea what was happening and I might as well been like the dude from Clockwork Orange who was brainwashed with his eyes taped open. Right after the second one kicked in  I got stuck in a mental thought loop where I could not perceive any conscious thought other than this is your last day on earth over and over again. I probably thought the phrase over a thousand times as I sat there. The Beatles song ""A Day in the Life"" played on loop in my mind  but not the nice part  the scary  dissonant crescendo part. The only words in my mind I could hear were YOU'RE DYING  YOU'RE DYING  YOU'RE DYING again and again.

I had just enough of my wits left in me to realize that I was about to puke so I got up as normally as I could  wobbling and jerking  and just pretended there was nobody else in the theater as I made my way for the exit. As I walked  my vision began to fail. Black spots dotted my scope of vision and things were morphing and shifting before me. I held the handrail as tightly as I could and completely lost my frontal vision as soon as I saw the bathroom. So  the last 20 or so feet I had to walk sideways like a crab using my peripheral vision as I could no longer see out of the front  only the sides. I noticed one of the popcorn minions was watching me carefully so I had to consciously act like I wasn't a drug addled lunatic because I was terrified they'd call the cops (at the time  we lived in a non legal state).

Made it to the bathroom just as the second edible peaked. I'd wager it was abound 1 to 1.5 hours after ingestion  although it felt more like 5 or 6. I stumbled into a stall and puked my guts out. I convinced myself my puke was full of blood and freaked out some more. Then I sat down on the toilet and tried to control my breathing  but every time I did I'd remember that my guts were bleeding and hyperventilate some more. I was distracted for a moment when I thought I saw a camera hidden in the stall lock and panicked some more because I thought the people in the theater were watching me on their phones through the camera in the bathroom. This sent me into a spiral so I sat on the toilet for a while burying my face in my hands and crying. At this point  I was wholly convinced of my imminent death. There was no peace with it at all  only pure  blind  primal panic. Nothing but adrenaline and the pounding of my own heart in my ears.

This period where I was alone in the movie theater bathroom was one of the worst moments of my life. I've overdosed on cocaine and opiates before  I've had severe alcohol poisoning  hell  I have had several bad trips before on both LSD and psilocybin but nothing compared to this. What I felt on those psychedelic bad trips was fear  yes  but it was more like awe and amazement to the point that made me nervous and blew my mind and my fears then were a result of my realization that I was just a teeny  little insignificant part of the universe. On an acid trip  I cried  but I also laughed and loved. Acid was scary at times but it was a good fear  the kind that makes you grow as a person. My bad weed trip  however  had no insight to offer whatsoever. There was no depth  no connectedness  no realizations  only primal  utter fear of the deepest kind that was disjointed and disharmonic. Like concentrated adrenaline and anxiety and confusion that was unrelenting  unceasing  and unyielding. I felt like a lost child in some evil and foreign place and that I would never see anyone or anything that I love ever again. Just pure fear.

After about 20 minutes in there which felt like a few more hours  my wife texted me asking if I was okay. She realized I hadn't come back and left the theater and was waiting for me on a bench outside of the bathroom. She offered to come in and help me but I didn't want to draw more attention to myself so I somehow managed to text her and say I need to just sit in here for a minute. She waited for me out there for about another 30 minutes before telling me she wanted to come get me so she could drive us home. At some point  I thought someone was banging on my stall's door and trying to get at me. Someone screaming at me to come out right fucking now. This very well could have been a hallucination of psychosis and not a real person. I don't know. It wasn't my wife  she waited outside for me as I sent her a garbled text that I'd be out in a minute.

My vision was still severely fucked up at this point and I couldn't see very well  so she took me by the arm and guided me out. I had to take the theater steps one at a time like a little old man because I was so unsteady on my feet. Somehow we made it to the car. I don't have any recollection of this journey. I remember walking out of the theater and then suddenly I'm in my car in the passenger seat. I cried a little bit more and I begged my wife not to drive yet because I was paranoid thinking the police were watching us and would drop spike strips to run us off the road. So we sat in the car for another 20 minutes before she said fuck it and drove us home  telling me I'd be more comfy if I was tripping out in bed instead of in public. I think I passed the peak somewhere on the drive home because my vision and hearing started to come back to me  and as soon as we got into the house I descended from paranoid mania into just being super fucking stoned. I fell asleep almost immediately in my bed and I was still ripped when I woke up for work the next day.

I was mentally fucked up for about two weeks after this experience. I felt semi-stoned for a solid 3 days and my memory was affected for the next 3 weeks. After a while  I tried to just laugh it off  and decided to try to smoke again. Well  it happened again  not nearly to the same degree but just enough to make me uncomfortable instead of fun-stoned. My mind just began to race and my anxieties really blew up. As soon as I took a puff  everything that had worried or troubled me that week immediately came to the front of my brain and it was all I could think about. I could no longer stand to be stoned around anyone other than my wife  as I felt they were all judging and laughing at me. So I just kinda stopped smoking. That was two years ago and every time since then that I've smoked  I'd had some degree of anxiety that made it unpleasant. I get so lost in my own head and very often spiral into a mild panic attack unless I'm at home with my wife and I can distract myself with a video game or something.

I do feel like this experience has permanently affected my brain as it relates to anxiety. Despite being in a better living situation today - better job  more money  more stability - than I was when this happened  I'm way more on edge most of the time. I live in fear of another panic attack like that  because THC seems to amplify all of my deepest fears  which is insane because for 90% of my life it had the complete opposite effect. Has anyone else experienced something similar? Anyone here gone from an enjoyer of cannabis to someone who lives in complete fear of it?",341,237,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1d5t89q/a_bad_thc_trip_has_left_me_with_permanent_anxiety/
Anxiety,A stranger destroyed all my confidence.,"I was standing in line for food and this woman her mother and her boyfriend came up behind me and asked if i was in line  i said a simple ""oh  yeah"" pointed at the line  went back to fiddling on my phone to ease my anxiety. And thus began the fifteen minute barrage of degrading comments. She made fun of my voice  the way i stood  i leaned against a wall and she made fun of it. I tried texting someone about the pinch i was in and she made fun of me for texting so much. By the time i finally got to order i could hardly speak because i was on the verge of throwing up. The whole time she made fun of me i was just hanging my head pretending not to hear...im never going back there again even though it was my favorite place to eat. When i leave the house now i feel so small and worthless. Everything she said was all the ""silly"" things my anxiety constantly nagged me about that I constantly assured myself nobody cared about. That stranger destroyed my confidence  i have no desire to go anywhere",1146,166,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/mz6fwk/a_stranger_destroyed_all_my_confidence/
Anxiety,I’m graduating from my masters program and no one cares,"So I’m graduating with my Masters at the end of December  but I finish classes in a few days. I also graduated college class of 2020 and spent my graduating sitting on my couch crying because I was so sad. I decided to try to let it go  since i would be getting a second graduation in a year and a half and most others didn’t. Now  it is my graduation and nobody cares. My sister is getting married the first weekend of January  so all the focus is on the wedding. I’m happy for her  but this is quite possibly the biggest accomplishment of my life and I feel like this wedding is completely overshadowing it. My sister and I already have a weird relationship  so this wedding hasn’t been the thing Im ~the most~ excited for  but it is still important to her. On top of this  no one in my family has said anything to me at all about my graduation. Mind you  she had an undergrad graduation and a law school graduation that my family flew out for both times. Since no one in my family was doing anything  I decided to just go out with my friends on new years  since that is the day I am an official graduate. However  because of rising covid cases  I can’t even do that  and I don’t want to force my friends to change their plans. I haven’t been this depressed or anxious about something in years and i just don’t know what to do. I talked to my parents and they feel bad but there’s nothing to do. Anyway  thanks for reading if you got this far. Just needed to vent. 

TLDR- my sisters wedding is overshadowing my only graduation and it’s causing a lot of sadness and anxiety for me

Edit: I am blown away by the kindness of strangers who don’t even know me  but took the time to write something nice. Sending all of you virtual hugs❤️ I am so appreciative of all your kind words

If you look at my first post you can see one of the things I've been through  my brother calls me a little baby for crying and my mom tells me to shut up. If my brother says he doesn't do it we can't do it. He rips on me for being emotional. Punches me for not giving him my food  called me fat and I almost starved myself.

Anxiety,I feel like nobody cares about my anxiety,"Hello  I am new on these subreddit. I am Mexican so sorry if I have ocassional bad english. I have lived through emotional and sexual abuse in my family and I think that Is a big part of my anxiety  maybe also genetics because my mom says she has been realy anxious all her life. I have been struggling with anxiety maybe since elementary school where I started getting hooked on porn to relieve it in some way. Then in middle school it converted to really bad social anxiety  and i mean really bad  to the point where every single day before going to school i felt like i was gonna vomit  my head  hands  and voice shaked so much when i was in parties or with people that i didn't know  i always felt like a fucking weirdo because of how much i shaked all the time. Even though i had severe social anxiety i was pretty popular in school because I really forced myself to socialize even if i felt like shit. In highschool i developed really bad deppression and had a couple of suicide attempts. I went to a lot of therapists but in the city I live most of them aren't really well prepared. One old lady even told me as a ""joke"" that I was so handsome that if she was younger she would have probably raped me (she was my therapist at the Time). I then went to a really proffesional CBT therapist which helped me A LOT. But now that I am in college getting my nursing degree  i feel my anxiety has become really worse. I can't concentrate on anything  i have so many racing thoughts all the Time  i procrastinate so much but Is not because I am lazy it is because I can't fucking keep my mind shut and concentrate on my school work. It has gotten so bad that about a week ago I had a manic attack and had severe depersonalization. I have an appointment with a psychiatrist on saturday  I hope the medication will help me. When I tell my girlfriend about the anxiety she doesn't really get  she Is just like ""I'm really sorry you feel like that  I Hope you can get better"" and I just feel like she says it for me to shut up or something  I know she cares about me but the way she expresses It Is just like she doesn't. When I told my Friends I was going to a psychiatrist they laughed and said that I was going crazy. I feel really alone in this and my suicide ideations have started to pop up again. I feel like there is no point of living if I can't even control my fucking mind. When I was going manic I literally felt I was losing my mind forever. I just want this to go away  why do i have to live through this while everyone else can have normal lives and not have 20 racing thoughts all at the same time all the time contradicting each other. After going through all that therapy  through exercise  meditation  journaling  I even tried ayahuasca. And after all of that I still feel like shit  I am starting to lose hope. If you read it all  thankyou.
Edit: I also wanted to ask that I have taken meds before but I have never fully completed a psychiatric treatment because anxiety medication like benzos make my mind so fucking stupid to a point i can't stand.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/xeix19/i_feel_like_nobody_cares_about_my_anxiety/
Anxiety,I’m freaking out right now and I’m desperate for help. Ever since I arrived in the Philippines for vacation a few days ago I’ve had so many bad symptoms in addition to derealization and I don’t know if they’re from anxiety or not. Nobody seems to care and it sucks.,"I went to the Philippines with my mom for vacation severely stressed right before seeing my family here. The flight was 14 hours long  but since I’ve been on the flight I could barely get any sleep. I have several conditions  POTS which usually gives me chronic fatigue and dizziness upon standing  but since then my symptoms have changed. I don’t get dizzy while standing anymore  but I feel off balance when walking. I used to have allergies as well back at home but since then I don’t even need to take a pill and I don’t get symptoms. I don’t know whether that means part of my health got better then part of it got worse. I don’t have cravings anymore and almost completely lost my appetite. When I try to sleep it takes me a while to fall asleep  and even then I wake up after 3 hours not sleepy at all. I don’t even remember my dreams anymore  I used to have very vivid dreams and now when I sleep it feels like nothing happened. Throughout the day I feel disconnected and detached from my surroundings like I’m going crazy. I also feel way more irritable than usual  and don’t want to interact with anyone. My family feels like strangers to me  none of them are to notice or care that something is wrong with me. Im on vacation and can’t see a doctor atm until 1 month from now and even then  I don’t know how I could tell them. 

I don’t know how my anxiety and health could get this bad and change this much just for going on vacation. I don’t know what the fuck is happening to me and it’s scaring the shit out of me. My mom had to pay so much money just to take me on vacation here in the Philippines and I feel like it’s such a waste since I can’t even enjoy it. I just want to feel something real again  nothing feels real. I want to burst out and cry because every time I try to relax or try to get better some shit happens and I end up feeling worse than before. I don’t know what I can do in the meantime. Im convinced anxiety isn’t even what’s causing me to feel crazy because how can I suddenly go from having POTS to the symptoms changing completely then go from having chronic fatigue to insomnia? Also how do my allergies suddenly just disappear yet everything else that’s happened to me makes me feel like shit. Someone please help me out I’m so desperate and I need a sign that I’ll be fine at least before school starts because I can’t concentrate  can’t feel fine like this.",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/w6pbns/im_freaking_out_right_now_and_im_desperate_for/

Anxiety,i'm so frustrated. why won't doctors listen to me? it feels like nobody understands. i feel so alone,"TLDR : i have anxious intrusive thoughts and my doctor prescribed me benzos without even telling me what they were or what they do  thankfully i did research before taking them. (no offense to anyone who takes benzos btw  im glad they work for you!) now i'm doing my own research to try and find a med that will help me so i can tell him i want to take it  because i don't trust him anymore. (i'm moving in a few months so there's no use it finding a new doctor atm). i feel so alone like nobody understands. any advice or support or anything would be greatly appreciated <3 thank you!



I feel like nobody is listening to me and nobody understands and i feel so alone. ( sorry for the repeated sentence).  I have intrusive thoughts. like getting stabbed or shot  people breaking into my work or my house. thinking about people hating me and leaving me and ruining my life. it mostly manageable  i can still go about every day. but i've noticed that it's so exhausting and takes a lot of my mental energy. being anxious all the time sucks. it seems to mostly impact my relationship  probably due to trauma from my previous relationships. i always think my boyfriend's going to leave me  he doesn't love me anymore  or that i upset him all the time and im too much to handle. as for work  i'm so paranoid of doing the wrong thing or making mistakes. and then the intrusive thoughts on top of that is just alot. i hadn't realized how much this was affecting me until recently.  
i've had the same psychiatrist for probably 3 years now. he prescribes me my antidepressants and sleep meds and i haven't had any complaints with those thus far.  and honestly i normally just go in  sit there  and then he gives me my medicine. i don't like him very much at all  im just doing what i cant to get my medicine. i've wanted a new psychiatrist for awhile but never found a new one  maybe that's my issue here. but i'm moving with my family across the USA in a couple months and there's no use it finding a new one now. i figured i'd just wait until we moved to talk to somebody but i decided to give it a shot and try talking to him. the first time i told him about my anxiety and wanting to be put on anxiety meds  it seemed to go very well. i told him  he said ok  and put me on a medicine (buspirone). Well that didn't work  it could've been my bad sleep schedule but i got very depressed and arguably more anxious. my sleep schedule has been bad before though and didn't feel like that. i told him i don't want to keep taking that one. he randomly asks me if i think i have adhd and i said ""well my grandma had it so idk maybe"" and he asked me if i wanted to get tested and i said ""sure""  did the test  he didn't tell me my results. i had to ask him what they were. he asked if i wanted to go on adhd meds BEFORE EVEN TELLING ME MY RESULTS and then he said ""well there's some indicators of adhd but not a ton. do you think your anxiety is caused by not being able to focus"" i said no. WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK ME THAT BEFORE I TOOK THE ASSESMENT?? i asked if there was another anxiety med and he prescribed me on klonopin. didn't even tell me the risks  what it does  nothing. just told me some common side effects like dizziness and lightheadedness and told me to call if anything like that happened. i told my therapist about them and she mentioned something about them being strong. then i did my research to find out their benzos. he said nothing about addiction or anything. i have a very addictive personality. i was addicted to self harm for years  finally got out of that about 2 years ago now. almost all of my father's siblings are addicts of some kind. hell  my parents even drink a lot. i was about to take highly addictive pills and not even know it. (if klonopin or any other benzos work for you then that's great! i hope nobody thinks im putting them down because that's not at all what im trying to do. I'm so frustrated that he didn't even bother to tell me or ask  let alone even ask me how my anxiety manifests. i can easily sit here and blame myself for not being more clear with him about how i'm feeling  i do have anxiety after all  but i'm still so angry with him. it's my body and hen should tell me about what i'm putting in it.

now i'm left here doing my own research on what medication can help intrusive thoughts. probably gonna make another appointment and tell him i don't want to take those and suggest another medicine  and i'm assuming he'll just give it to me. I could also make an appointment with my primary doctor or just wait unitl i move. about the meds  i'm leaning towards zoloft (Sertraline)  i took that a few years ago but that was when my depression was really bad  now i'm just trying to fix the anxiety and intrusive thought's because the depression is under control. i think he had originally suggested that but i had told him i had taken it before  i hadn't considered the fact that it might help me now. i'm just really nervous to possibly have an adverse effect.   
literally any advice or support or ANYTHING would be greatly appreciated. if you read all this  thank you so much. i genuinely appreciate it so much more then you know <3",1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1iv82zh/im_so_frustrated_why_wont_doctors_listen_to_me_it/

Anxiety,I typically have 5-10 anxiety attacks per day and I feel so alone,"TW: suicidal thoughts  s*xual assault

I’m about to type a lot  if anyone reads the whole thing it would seriously mean the entire world. I’ve had anxiety for probably my whole life  but within the last 11 years it has skyrocketed to a whole different level. I also have a number of other mental health problems  such as depression  PTSD  bulimia  and BPD  and every day feels like a constant battle between myself and my anxiety and my surroundings. It never ends. When I’m out and about I get overwhelmed because there’s so many things going on  but when I’m in a quiet safe zone my mind thinks it has permission to go insane since I’m finally relaxed. I don’t get a break unless I’m sleeping  except WOW now I’m getting anxiety attacks in my sleep. I get them from really really tiny things  such as my water being too cold  an apple being too mushy  wearing a necklace too close to my neck  eating eggs  my back hurting  wearing a backpack and the strap being on my neck  spiders  being around a lot of men at once  and so much more. But I also get them from more “severe” things  and those ones are so deadly. I like to think of my anxiety attacks like a really steep mountain  where the bottom of it has thoughts like “I don’t know how to get out of bed without freaking out”  then the middle of it is stuff like “I need something sharp”  and the top of it is where it becomes almost irreversible and I have no choice but to jump off of the mountain and succumb to the thoughts and urges. I could go down the mountain from there  but it’s so steep that I can barely walk and I most likely will trip and fall anyways. Yes I am in therapy  I’m in the process of switching medication to get one that works better for me  I have a pretty good support system  but I still feel so fucking alone. My anxiety attacks have led me to suicidal ideation  I’ve had multiple attempts throughout the last few years  some of them were so close that I had to go to the hospital. It just feels like the end of the world and I can’t live like this. I can’t even enjoy good things in my life  for example my friendship with my best friend of 3 1/2 years. She is my rock and has gotten me through hundreds of anxiety attacks  she knows me better than I know myself  I love her more than I can explain  but I feel like I’m holding her down in this friendship because of my anxiety. In a weird way  having her as my friend makes me want to k*** myself more  because if I’m gone then she won’t ever have to worry about me ever again. I can’t ever tell her that though because I don’t want her to interpret that like we shouldn’t be friends anymore  that’s not what I want at all and I definitely think that would make me even more suicidal. But it’s like..I can’t even enjoy a beautiful friendship without these thoughts lingering. It fucking sucks. For context  I was sxually abused for 4 years between ages 10-14  and that caused irreversible damage for me. Now any time I am in a situation involving something he used to use on me  or if someone touches my back/waist  or someone says his name referring to someone else with the same name  I freak out like crazy. People think I’m weird and skittish for it  I just tell them I get scared easily  but it goes a lot deeper than that and I wish more than anything that I could just stop. It’s preventing me from living my life normally  I can’t even go outside most days because I’m scared I’m going to get hurt  but at the same time the only thing that’s actually out to hurt me right now is myself. I’ve done more damage to my body and my mental health than anyone has  and that’s after I was r***d hundreds of times. I can’t run from myself  I can’t take a break from being in my body  I can’t just become someone else for a few minutes to decompress. I’m stuck. I just want it to stop. It’s insane how mental stress can impact someone’s life so much. I wish more than anything that I could live normally and not be affected by everything. My best friend fully believes I’m going to get better  and I don’t know how to tell her that I’m more on the edge than I ever have been. I don’t know how to tell anyone that to be honest. So that’s why I’m here. I’m not looking for a diagnosis  I don’t need empathy  I just want to know that someone hears me and understands. I’ve never met anyone who has anxiety on the level that I do  and it’d be nice to know that it’s not just me.

Do any of you feel the same way? How do you find others who are also in therapy? Are there any communities or groups where people share their experiences and support each other?

Anxiety,I'm dangerously scared I may be losing myself  and I feel so alone,"I honestly don't know where to begin with this. I'm struggling badly to get out of bed  I don't feel like eating  talking  or even socialising with other people  including my own family. Even just the thought of doing these things are causing me to have extreme panic attacks to the point where I feel like I'm dying from a heart attack  or extreme blood pressure.

For a while now  I have struggled with anxiety and depression  have been in and out of therapy  on multiple medications  but I feel like I'm falling further down day by day. I haven't been able to sleep properly for at least 4 years now  at least not at night  and every time I wake up  I have a severe panic attack  which has caused me to feel scared about going to sleep  for fear of having to experience these horrible feelings again. Furthermore  this dysfunctional sleep schedule has caused problems between me and my family  who are starting to notice my issues  and getting frustrated over it  which is pressurising me even further to the point where my symptoms become more aggressive  which I feel is worsening my condition. I feel to scared to even come out of my room  let alone outside  and I can't think of a way out. I also feel that my lack of sleep (or rather proper nighttime sleep  as I often sleep during the day due to worrying all night) is gradually causing me to lose my mental stability and could kill me quite soon  from some illness or disease related to sleep deprivation  as if I didn't feel like I was dying enough already from anxiety alone. 

Another serious concern I have is that I won't be able to find  or keep a job in the future due to my debilitating symptoms  and therefore won't be able to afford a place of my own  or even basic needs such as food or heating. I'm really keen to move out  but not sure if it will ever be possible  due to mental health. On top of that  I'm beginning to feel like I'll never be able to do anything at this stage  not even engage in relaxing or fun activities such as going for walks  eating  or going out with friends. I'm afraid I may even end up homeless due to my illness  financial instability  and problems with my family  who understandably are feeling affected by my lack interaction  but I just can't bring myself to speak to others just now  and I feel pretty misunderstood. All of these difficulties are causing me to feel very alone  and even more ill from my physical symptoms  to the point where I become irreversibly psychotic. Is this likely to be the case in the long run? Has anyone else faced a similar experience? How can I cope with this mental hell?

Anxiety,I Feel So alone after i guess a panic attack.,"Hello I recently had a very bad exsperiance and i cant seem to stop my brain from thinking about it no matter what i do. i havent really delt with anxiety i guess but i feel now that im dealing with anxiety and both heath anxiety even tho the doctor said everything was fine with my heart.

a short summery is i smoked out of a bong and i suppose got to high and i guess had a panic attack or mutiple because my heart rate would go from 25bpm-180bpm on my at home finger pulse checker thing. i went to the doctors at and was there from 5pm-3am and they said everything was fine and such didnt say anything about me having a heart attack or something but i cant stop thinking about it and its really wearing me out.

Full Version bellow

Hello I am Hades 23 female i know this post is old but a few days ago Me and my Partner were taking a hit off a water pipe and we were sitting and i was looking at my parter when i get very sad and upset over the future so i stood up to go walk outside to try and calm down but instead i got outside and he followed me and i started walking back and forth trying to calm down and i told him to go grab our little at home heart monitor and he did and he stuck it on my finger and it said that i was at 30 bpm and i felt a pulse of heat take over my body and i fell into his arms and after that i decided the best rout to take was to start walking so we started walking and as we did my monitor would swap between 30-45 bpm to 160-180 bpm i walked for about an hour i believe untill i was able to go sit down in the bed still feeling terrible. i laid in bed trying to fall asleep from 5am-10am around 10am i finally fell asleep and woke up still feeling kinda shitty so i called my mother and explained to her the situation and she said to go to the doctor so we went to the ER at 5pm and as we got to the er and waited in line to talk to the people to get checked in i guess i put the heart monitor on and it said i was at 25 sitting at the er so i sat there sumwhat panicing in the waiting room with my mind racing and finally they took me back and did tests they did the ekg machine and they did a chest xr and of course took vitals and such you know normal doctor things and from 6pm-3am they monitored and told me eveything was fine there were no problems and things like that and they gave me fluids saying i was dehydtrated and sent me home. i slept ok not great but enough and spent all day trying to convince myself that everything was ok and it wasnt a heart attack but most likely just a panic attack or an anxiety attack but i havent been the same since that night  Im tired and feel i guess fatuiged. i have never had heath anxiety before but i feel like its really taking a toll on me and i just wanna sleep but im afraid that it will drop again and i wont wake up and i feel like i want to talk about ti but every time i do i get so worried its gonna happen again. im pretty sure if it was a heart attack the doctors would of known and such but my brain wont shut off and i used smoking to control my brain not shutting off but im so scared to smoke now also and im just at a loss and feel so alone.",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1fo0l8r/i_feel_so_alone_after_i_guess_a_panic_attack/

Anxiety,I haven't self harmed in one whole year.,"The last time I self harmed was about a year ago. (I know  even more depressing because it was near Christmas!)

I have been dealing with anxiety and self harm for three and a bit years now. I didn't ever think I would get a mental illness and the fact that the self harm evolved from that was even worse. It's so weird to think that this one thing happening in my life changed everything for me. It was all very sudden as well. I started locking myself away from friends and family  school became a hell hole and I was just alone with no idea what was going on with my head.

 I never got treatment. My mum tried to get some woman to help me  she came to our house and I swear to god...she was useless. I appreciate the fact that my mum wanted to help but there was apart of me that didn't want the help. I'd been living with this monster for so long  it started to feel like apart of my identity now. I was scared that I wasn't 'ill enough' or I would be wasting my time there  they wouldn't actually care and they were just greedy for money. Thinking about it now I understand how crazy that sounds of me to think like that but who could blame me from the state I was in?

My dad started to notice and became infuriated with me. It's difficult to explain to people who haven't gone through it  so that just made it worse. A few people that did stick around would pop up on my phone  and it was constant. They wanted to know how to help and even I didn't know what exactly was wrong with me. How can someone help if even you don't know what's wrong? I had completely lost touch with the real world.

Three years later  it's still extremely difficult but I persevere...because even though you may think it can't get better  it always does. I used to RAGE when ever anyone told me that but it's true.

To be honest  I don't think I will ever overcome my mental health  but I've been doing incredibly better thoughtout those three years. I've grown as a person  I've learnt new things  experienced new happy memories and I'm actually going to have a clean  joyful Christmas. This present time in my life is currently the happiest I've been since. The best part is that I'm thankful. Of course there are days when I think I wish it wasn't around but my mental health has taught me so much and made me stronger. I am thankful! So...THANK YOU ANXIETY! THANK YOU!

Remember to love your brain and your body. You only get one life  spend it the best way you possibly can. Give yourself breaks  if you are having a shitty day don't force yourself into anything  take a day off and pick yourself back up the following day. Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't 'ill enough' to get treatment or that your mental health makes you 'worthless'. There is so much more to life than pain and suffering.
And most importantly... Congratulate yourself for getting past even a couple of days  a few weeks  a few months. It might not seem like much to you but every extra day you don't self harm  you are beating it! I believe in you all.
Learn to love your brain <3

Merry Christmas guys x",951,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/edx16n/i_havent_self_harmed_in_one_whole_year/
Anxiety,I keep getting extremely angry from my anxiety attacks TW: Self Harm,Today we finally (after 5 days) came by my grandmas house to pick up my desk  and monitor and all that since moving into our new house. I've been telling my parents this entire week to get my desk since I am in college and need a place to work  it's been super frustrating  but when we got it today I had to pack everything up super quickly because my parents waited the last minute to pick it up and they were rushing me to get everything in the car because they need to get ready for a wedding we are going to. I was trying to get everything into the car because it seems they didn't want to help me with my bags at all  and as I am putting all of my things into the car  my mom comes up from behind me and just starts telling me how I am doing everything wrong  and then she tells me that my pants are falling down and she can see my skin. At this point I am so frustrated from everything that I start scratching my face really roughly and close my eyes in anger and tears fall down my face as I'm grinding my teeth. I was seething  and super overstimulated and wanted to just scream and break everything and throw everything away. Does this happen to anyone else?

Anxiety,How I Overcame DPDR (symptoms  feedback loop  anxiety  my story  tips & advice),"Hi everyone  I really wanted to do/felt like I should make a separate master-post for how I overcame DPDR (depersonalization and derealization) that was triggered by long-term anxiety  as well as some of the symptoms  mechanisms of DPDR  feedback loop  triggers & more.

I made a previous master-post on my long-term anxiety symptoms (which I overcame) where I went over the more bizarre  rarely spoken about  constant symptoms of long-term anxiety  and the feedback loop and it seemed to help a lot of people. I will link that one below  I recommend everyone read it first!

https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/10jcfko/longterm_anxiety_symptoms_i_had_from_someone_who/

A lot of you wanted to know how I overcame the DP/DR symptoms. I didn't realise that I had message requests on Reddit  and now I've got so many spanning across months ago that I can't find the time to get back to individually so I feel like its my duty to make this post and have it all in one place. Warning  this is a big post.

Lets go over some positives first as I find its always best to get off on a positive note  and to have something to look forward to or motivate others:

**1. DP/DR (Depersonalization and Derealization) is not and is never permenant  anyone who says so are catastrophizing and are probably biased or feeling that way due to their own condition not improving. These notions are not helpful and are also not true.**

**It will and can go away 100%  it is not something you have to 'deal' with or 'accept' for the rest of your life.**


**2. DP/DR does not work like a debt system e.g. the longer you are in DP/DR  the longer it is going to take you to get out of it (isn't true!). Everyone has the same chance of success in recovering from DP/DR  no matter how long or short you have been in that state.**
**3. DP/DR is not indicative or a sign of psychosis  and you will not become psychotic if you experience DP/DR.**


DP/DR is a **defense mechanism**  which attempts to make sure that only the body experiences pain or trauma and not the mind  by causing detachment. **Causes of DP/DR can be anxiety attacks  severe stress  health anxiety  drug induced (often from edibles or hallucinogens)  traumatic first-hand or second-hand situations  abuse or any interpersonal trauma. Anyone of any age can experience DP/DR.**

.......................................................................

**What does DP/DR feel like?:**

- Everything feels (and looks) either too close or too far away from you  environments are distorted
- Everything feels flat or 2D  like it isn't quite real or tangible  others faces might feel unreal
- Can feel like the world is slipping away from you
- You might feel like you could fall over any second or fall through the floor
- Speech can feel slow/slurred  like your brain is struggling to find words
- Time can feel like its going too fast or too slow
- Feeling like you can observe yourself outside your body  everything feels disconnected  like you are very alone
- Your limbs can feel too small  too big  like you are taller or shorter than you actually are
- You might feel internally dizzy (like your mind is spinning but your vision isn't)  woozy head feelings  fuzzy head
- More frequent feelings of nostalgia/dejavu
- Colours can feel more dull or distorted
- Feeling numb  like your memories are less tangible or unreal
- Hypochondria (Healthy Anxiety) is often a huge comorbidity with DP/DR

.......................................................................

**The Feedback Loop  what is it?**

Symptoms of DP/DR (as well as Anxiety/Health Anxiety) are often kept alive by or started something called the **Feedback Loop.** This is a loop that is constantly being fed into  which could have started from something as for example:

*You may be minding your own business one day and suddenly experience a Panic Attack  but you misread it as being something worse. You could think you're about to die  that you are having a heart attack because of the palpitations  that you could collapse any moment now  and then it goes... but you're on edge  what if it happens again? Do I have a heart condition? I think I'm dying  I think something is wrong. Everyday you are waking up and checking if you can feel palpitations  you're scared it will happen again  you're getting waves of dread  your mind is full of 'what ifs' over and over again every single day. Then one day  nothing feels real and you feel completely detached from reality and this scares you even more  you feel like you're slipping away  you're terrified and feel like you'll never be normal again. You're waking up everyday to check if everything still feels unreal  and it does  its not going away. Whats happening?*


This is the **Feedback Loop** example which led to DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms. What should've happened when you experienced for example: a Panic Attack  was that **you should've been able to realise it was a Panic Attack and been able to ground yourself or calm down during that situation and it would go away. This would eliminate the start of the Feedback Loop**  but instead by misreading the situation or not having the appropriate tools to manage it  you are now in fear  in high stress and feeling traumatised of the situation in fear it will happen again or that something worse is happening to you. This keeps the Loop alive and going.

**In preparation for the pain or fear you are about to anticipate happening  your body chose to disassociate from your mind and cause DP/DR in order to handle the stress and fear of what you're afraid of experiencing. DP/DR is attempting to save you from what could happen to you next  after being activated from something that already hurt you or traumatised you.**

Identifying the first source of your DP/DR can be particularly important in understanding and learning where your Feedback Loop started. **For some people it can even extend to as far as childhood  which can sometimes result in something known as DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)**. Once you have identified the source  this is the stepping stone into recovering from DP/DR.

Sources of DPDR can be: drug-induced from hallucinogens/edibles/bad trips/alcohol or other substances  anxiety attacks  depression  stress  medical trauma/childhood trauma/adulthood trauma/being a child of divorce  sexual assaults/CSA  PTSD  DID and more

Environments are also very important to be recognised as sources of DPDR e.g. stressful jobs  stressful/abusive relationships  difficult home life  being a full-time carer for family  difficult school life etc

.......................................................................

**So what's going to help me get better?**

There's a lot of resources and therapies available for DP/DR  such as Psychotherapy (talking therapies)  CBT  DBT  EMDR and more.

But what is most important is that you are able to help yourself  as well as having professional support should you require it. **The thing that is going to get you better the most is you  and the tools you can develop to help you in time of need and in how you navigate the world and your trauma**. Some people (like me) may be able to recover from DP/DR without professional intervention or therapies  but it is always incredibly recommended if you have access or can afford it. **With DP/DR being highly trauma related  it is important to have a safe place to unload and traverse trauma with a professional**  as it can be tough to handle alone. **If you are concerned or suspect your DP/DR may be a result of DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)  professional help is absolutely necessary.**

Every person with DP/DR will be completely unique in their needs  what they can handle alone or what they need support with.

.......................................................................

**What can we do for ourselves?**

This is going to go over some self-practices and tools you can do in your own time to help yourself while actively experiencing DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms  and also how to reduce the chances of re-experiencing it when you are recovered.

**Staying Busy & Challenging Yourself:**

A big part of dissolving the Feedback Loop is by no longer feeding into it  and one way of doing this is by diverting our thoughts from the feelings of DP/DR or anxiety symptoms. **You want to find or make opportunities where you don't have time to think about DP/DR  or how it makes you feel  'scanning' for feelings or signs of it  and to challenge those feelings instead.**
**DP/DR and anxiety is the perfect time to get busy and involved with life**  whether it is your hobbies  being with your friends and family  doing chores that need to be done  starting things you've always wanted to do. **It can feel scary  even terrifying to partake in these things when you feel unreal  like you're not present or that the world is slipping away  but you must keep pushing through**. Once you begin to challenge yourself and challenge those feelings of 'not feeling real' you begin to establish trust within yourself.

**Don't be disheartened that DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms do not disappear right away overnight  this is because your body hormonally  needs time to acclimate to low levels of stress and anxiety after having been kept at such high levels. If these hormones were to plummet immediately  the body wouldn't be able to cope  so it likes to decline it gently! So consider it like you are establishing trust:**

DP/DR has been in the drivers seat all this time  and you've been the passenger in the back. You're finally insisting on being in the driver's seat  but DP/DR insists on being the passenger right next to you. DP/DR is going to freak out in the passenger seat and take the wheel from you at times during some tough situations because its not sure you can navigate it on your own  and instead of letting it take the driver's seat again you need to say to it  'Don't worry. I've got this'. and DP/DR will let go of the wheel. This in real life  would be an example of you handling the situation you are in and challenging yourself to face what makes you afraid (such as going outside in case you feel 'unreal').

**By doing this  you are establishing trust and are giving DP/DR the opportunity to know that you can handle the situation on your own. Eventually with time of practicing these things  DP/DR will get out of the car entirely and you can 'drive' all by yourself again and those feelings of DP/DR will be gone. You'll be able to live your life without things like anxiety or DP/DR dictacting where it takes you or how it makes you feel. You will have formed that trust that you can handle experiencing your pain  your fear  your trauma  your anxiety/stress etc. without the need of the defence mechanism of DP/DR. You will become the first line of defence!**

From personal experience this is what accelerated me to my complete recovery from DP/DR and long-term anxiety symptoms within 3-4 months of this practice after struggling for almost a year of non-stop DP/DR and anxiety symptoms. **I learned to empathise with my DP/DR's attempt at trying to keep me safe and acknowledged that it was only doing this in order to make me feel better  albeit in a scary and inconvenient way! So by learning techniques and also teaching myself not to be scared of DP/DR symptoms or my anxiety symptoms  I gave myself the opportunity to be the one in control and say ''Hey  I am totally capable of caring for myself now. Thank you for your help and what you tried to do for me'' to my DP/DR.**

By feeling afraid to participate in activities or doing things because you might feel unreal  or because the world feels distorted  you are allowing DP/DR to maintain control and are keeping DP/DR as an option

**Challenge yourself in incriments or in steps  and remember to reward yourself afterwards. Figure out what about DP/DR makes you afraid:**

**is it seeing people's faces? particularly friends or family?** - challenge yourself towards looking at faces  engaging with familiar faces (YouTubers  family  partners)  if you can touch their face then touch it  grounding exercises where you say ''I can see two eyes  they are [insert colour]  they have a [description] nose  do they have freckles? birth marks? do they have any smile lines? identify parts of their face and describe them'' this helps make them more tangible and less scary. Do little challenges before the bigger ones.

**is it going outside in case you feel unreal? woozy?** - challenge yourself towards small  short walks up and down your street  to eventually longer walks  acknowledge that you might be feeling dizzy/unreal but that you are safe  be kind & go home if you need it  try again another day  stay engaged with your hobbies/the outside world

**is it the feeling that you'll never be the same again? that you think its permenant? that you've ruined your life?** - The first thing you'll see if you look up 'can dpdr be permenant' is 'no!' and every other article will say no. There has never been an observed case of DPDR being permenant  and you won't be the first case of that happening. Its really important you do not entertain or engage with people who believe it is permenant  or that theirs is permenant because they are just people who are keeping their own DPDR alive with the negativity. I recommend writing positive affirmations or reading them  and engaging with positive stories of DPDR recovery and sticking with facts. **You have not ruined your life  and you will recover.**
**DPDR can make you feel afraid of lots of things  not just the ones I described above (but those are the most common).**

**Grounding Exercises:**
Grounding is a way to refocus and bring your attention back to the present and the world around you. This is can be used when experiencing fear or anxiety of your current DP/DR state  but is **most effective when you feel like it is 'coming on' or you are experiencing anxiety/stress that could lead to it.**

Grounding exercises can involve:

- Naming 5 things you can see  name 4 things you can touch and to touch them  naming 3 things you can hear and listening to them  what 2 things can you smell  1 thing you can taste.
- Holding ice cubes  putting your hands in cold water  picking up or touching things and explaining how it feels (is it cold  warm  does it feel rough or soft)  identifying their colours deeply
- Walks without music  tuning into the sounds of your steps  counting your steps  observing your surroundings on your walks  sitting in the grass and touching it.
- Mental anchoring by saying (in your head or quietly to yourself) your full name  your age  where you live  what street you live on  the date  where you are  what you're doing. Repeat this gently until you feel calm.
- Self-assurance phrases such as  ''You are okay''  ''Nothing can hurt me''  ''You will get through this''  ''I've done this once and I can do it again'' etc.

.......................................................................

**My Example of How I Personally Recovered from DPDR:**

For me I dealt with a lot of wooziness/dizziness during my DP/DR and I felt terrified to do anything sitting up or standing because I'd have to acknowledge that dizzy feeling and the unreal-ness from DP/DR  so I would lie on my side all day while watching TV or playing games instead to cope. **I wanted to turn 'Oh god  no I'm dizzy and woozy and nothing feels real  I'm so scared' into 'Oh I'm dizzy and feel unreal today? Lets see what I can manage'.**

It started to become more of 'Let's get up! Lets engage with the same hobbies but lets sit up this time'. I'd do that for as long as I feel I could handle the dizzines and unreal sensations  and then I'd lie back down again. I rewarded myself and cared for myself with a technique that brought me comfort  while having succeeded in engaging with something that scared me or was difficult. Over time I'd start to sit up for longer  or I'd start to go outside on short walks (which was particularly hard as I'd feel more unreal outside than at home)  and I would feel unreal  like everything was flat  like the world was slipping away but I did it.

Some days I would just cry or feel like I took steps back  that I'd be stuck forever but I kept going and I kept rewarding myself after those times with either little lie downs  eating things I really loved  engaging in self-care or watching familiar TV shows I know I loved. Over time I started to sit up a lot more  I started to stand more  I started to go out more and for much  much longer each time  I started to do all the things I loved again despite how I felt. **Don't get me wrong  I still felt unreal and dizzy but I wanted to stop being scared of it and to not let it stop me engaging with things I loved or wanted to do.**

**I stopped basing my days and thoughts on 'how good I'm feeling' and more so on 'how well can I manage today'.** That took away a lot of pressure for me  as I knew I would not feel better over night but I would learn to manage my days better  so focusing on that intrinsically helped me feel better. You'll want to learn how to manage bad days (whether DPDR days  anxious days  stressful days) because when you do  you'll become prepared for if you ever face any of those times again and you can conquer it!

One day after months of challenging myself  being more present  doing my hobbies  going outside (I remember this vividly) I was hugging my partner and I looked up at his face and I physically jumped  **he looked real. I started looking around everywhere and everything felt real  everything looked so colorful  the world didn't feel flat or distorted  everything felt 'real' and 'right' and when I touched my partner's face it felt so tangible and real.** I don't think I've ever cried that hard in my life from happiness  my DPDR was gone.

Everything probably felt like this for a while  but because I was so engrossed in engaging with the world around me and doing the things I loved I didn't actually realise it  because I was no longer questioning my reality or looking for signs of DP/DR. **So that one moment where I finally remembered to 'check' my reality  it made me realise everything felt real again and that I felt human again. And it never came back.**

When you feel ready  the key is to be kind to yourself as well as challenge yourself against your DPDR and how it makes you feel. By pushing through and engaging with the world around you bit by bit you will start to establish that trust  those tools  in convincing your body that you can handle yourself and that it no longer needs to detach with DPDR to keep you safe.

.......................................................................

**Some habits to get into  and some to get rid of:**

- **Cut out all alcohol and all drugs absolutely and completely  as well as caffeine & reduce or quit smoking.** All of these substances will have an effect on the hormones in your body  and can impede progress from DP/DR due to the sensations it can produce and will generally stress out the body  and mind-altering drugs like hallucinogens or Cannabis can worsen DP/DR greatly or keep it around. *If you are an addict or suffer from addictions  get in touch with services that can help you taper  detox or navigate potential sobriety  do not attempt any of this alone.*

- **Establish a normal bedtime routine**  ideally getting into bed at 9-10pm and waking up before 9am. Some people need more sleep than others so wake up at whatever time in the morning before 9am is best for you; getting adequate sleep will greatly improve the rate of which your DP/DR can dissolve as your mind will be most lucid  alert and prepared to handle potential stressors. **Sleeping too much or too little can greatly affect your brain and hormone regulation  and you need the best hormone regulation in order for the body to lower cortisol levels which leads to DP/DR symptoms rapidly improving.**

- **Stay hydrated and well-fed.** This is really typical mental health advice  but in general you will want to make sure you are hydrated and well-fed so the body has enough energy supply to handle stressors  anxiety and to ensure the mind is as lucid and energised as possible. You will need all the energy you can possibly get  and having these bases covered can really improve your symptoms.

- **Get checked for any Vitamin Deficiencies** as a lot of Vitamins we can be deficient in will greatly effect circadian rhythms  heart rhythms  the brain (deficiencies can cause brain fog  low motor skill function and poor hormone regulation). **Making sure we have healthy  functioning foundations to work off of greatly supports mental function and our ability to take on new information and learn new things (such as therapeutic tools and treatment).**

- **Identify your stressors and reduce them  identify your triggers and navigate them.** Cortisol levels increase with stress (from stressors) and anxiety  when we are faced with high levels of cortisol for extended periods of time  the body can produce bizzare and scary symptoms (which are harmless).

Anxiety,Please stop medication shaming,"This is a PSA to the anxiety community. It's bad enough when you get it from people who don't even understand the concept of having anxiety  it's 10x worse when it comes from people within the community who also suffer from anxiety disorders.

Goddamn I get it left and right from fellow anxiety sufferers the very moment I mention that I'm on medication. It always turns into preaching. You may think you're helping  but you're really not. There are many different preachy topics people get into  but the main sentiments are ""oh  you're just not strong enough and are weak and leaning on the meds because not using them would be too hard for you."" Or ""oh they're really bad for you if you keep taking those you're going to end up with dementia-cancer by the age of 30"" 

Fuck off. I experienced something traumatic. I was not able to handle it without the assistance of meds. Therapy alone did not cut it. Going for walks outside or whatever didn't help either  which some people smugly like to suggest. I was in so much fear that I literally disassociated from myself. Meds kept me from being hospitalized.

I got shit from my doctor and people on here (not this sub specifically I haven't commented here before). You're going to die horribly for being on those meds! be afraid! be scared! feel ashamed!

Well guess what  I found a fantastic therapist who completely understands my plight. In one of our first sessions when I told her that the meds saved my life and that therapy alone wouldn't have ever helped  she IMMEDIATELY agreed and was like ""oh yep definitely. It's too powerful of a reaction/feeling. I know."" She herself experienced some trauma from her past  and she told me that when she stopped drinking and was on an anti-anxiety med for her panic disorder someone smugly told her ""oh so you dropped one addiction for another."" Oh boy did I have some shared anger with her over that. 

I really don't care to hear anyone's ""help"" or ""advice"" when it comes to my choice to take medications. I don't want your shaming  or how you were able to overcome your issues without medication  good for you. I don't want to hear how bad it is for me health-wise. There's this holier-than-thou preachy mindset disguised as sympathy and I fucking hate it. OOooOOoo they're so bad for you! Guess what's also bad for me? Not eating or sleeping or fulfilling basic biological needs to survive due to fear. Hm. Wonder which is worse?

I would rather live a shorter happier life due to relief from my anxiety due to meds than live a long tortuous life because that's what people say I should do. My doctor was brutal to me about being on the meds until I said essentially that to her  and then she finally laid off. 

And addiction doesn't happen to everybody. I had someone lecture me on how this medication I was on was going to give me a full blown addiction until I told them that once I was doing better I just simply got off of them and was off of them for months. They sure didn't have anything to say to that. 

So bottom line  stop shaming people who choose medications  if you want to celebrate that you're so healthy and untainted by pharmaceuticals  go do it somewhere else. Not everyone is that lucky. Yes I'm bitter.

edit: to be clear all of this mostly comes from the fact that I take **benzos ** which are apparently a big no-no to many people. I'm not sure if I would have had the same experience from people if I were taking non-benzos. People really love to scare me about those. But they saved my life and continue to do so  so  *shrug.*",935,345,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/mhlufw/please_stop_medication_shaming/

Anxiety,How I Beat my Anxiety Disorder and Advice on How to do so Yourself,"So if you’re reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder  let me start by saying I know how you feel. I’ve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don’t stop  I’ve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end  I’ve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water  had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I’ve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I’ve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times  I’ve had racing  intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I’ve felt like I was going crazy. A lot.

But I’m here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort  all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I’ll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks  but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn’t really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .

So I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety  mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you’re at  scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.

I don’t discuss responses to specific symptoms here  just a general approach. If you’re looking for tactics for specific symptoms  check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom  but you can try the third if you don’t feel it makes enough of a difference.

Before you read  I want to mention something once so I don’t have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you’ll feel like you made incredible progress  and others you’ll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It’s going to be a lot of two steps forward  one step back. Sometimes it’ll even be two steps forward  two steps back. But even those times are okay  because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort  things will start gradually getting better.

So here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.

If you’re at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can’t calm down:

At this stage  you’re either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I’ve had maaaaaany panic attacks  so I know this advice will work for both.

**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:

* Don’t try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first  but with practice you’ll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes  I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms  the more worried you become  which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones  causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. 

* Questions  doubts  and fear will come up. When they do  remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through  and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult  but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.

* If this isn’t working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won’t stop  ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it  run towards your symptoms. If you’ve ever read a book on ACT  this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse  you’ll find it can’t. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry  and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease  then move on to step 2. In case you’re interested  the clinical term for this is “arousal reappraisal.” It’s not discussed very often  but I found it to be very helpful. 

**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment  this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic  but in The DARE Response  Barry McDonagh calls it being “engaged.” This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you’re at  this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it  so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again  MUCH easier said than done  and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it’s an integral part of recovery. When I first started out  I found short activities the most helpful  like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two  or doing homework. 

**3.** Give it time. Your system can’t sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you’ll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.

**4.** If recommended by your physician  a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants  but they’re no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium  I didn’t feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning  but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term  and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo  you’ll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point  you’re in a constant state of panic  they’re a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety  so you can start focusing on the long term.

**5.** Journal. I don’t recommend this as much beyond this stage  as I’ve found it doesn’t really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD  I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you’re thinking or feeling. It’s a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.

**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block  take a stretch break at work. You don’t need to be doing a full workout at this point  just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you’re getting for something productive.

**7.** This one may seem rather minor  but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It’s much easier to feel short of breath when you’re in a position that doesn’t let you breath easily. If you’re lying down  lay on your back. If you’re sitting  sit up straight.

Once you’ve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks)  you can move on to the next step.

Constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:

If you’re at this phase  you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety  like jitters  nausea  jelly legs  shortness of breath  and so on. But you’re not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time  you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here’s what to do at this stage:

**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you’re going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what’s going on in your brain and body  the better you’ll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they’ll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end  this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you’re knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal  you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact  I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety  the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized  but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible  which is how I consumed them):

* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who’s been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you’re at the higher end of the anxiety scale.

* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It’s aimed at treating depression  but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing  then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It’s long  so I don’t think you need to do the first part  but there’s a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.

* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT  1/4 lifestyle guidance  and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do  and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.

* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before  and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren’t worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as “an incurable disease” in this book. He’s not a doctor or therapist and isn’t really knowledgeable on the subject  so I’d take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.
Remember  the point of these books isn’t to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.

**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety  and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with  you’ll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:

* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you’re saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?

* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring  but he didn’t know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics  like square breathing. 

* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?
It may take a while until you find a therapist who’s right for you  but this is a person you’ll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. 

**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms  the more quickly they’ll dissipate. In addition  if you can  start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you’re taking it three times a day  try to move down to two. If you’re down to two a day  try one.

**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:

* Cardiovascular exercise. It’s said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you’re anxious  but I’d like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you’re anxious  your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don’t dump it out somehow  the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you’re not super exercise savvy  my suggestion is to get out and walk  jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy  but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don’t need to do sprints whenever you run  but you’ll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.

* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you’re having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind  the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact  it’s almost the opposite. While meditating  your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds  and you’re just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate  and it includes helpful techniques like noting  so I won’t go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first  then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.

* Diet. If you’re reading this  you’ve probably read the do’s and don’ts of your diet about a hundred times  but I’ll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine  no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods  and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation  though the research isn’t entirely there yet. Regardless  try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I’ll defer to the DARE Response for information about it)  though again  research is shaky so this alone won’t bring change. 

* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor’s discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants  some don’t. I didn’t feel like they helped me all that much  but you might. Note  the purpose of antidepressants isn’t to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won’t change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.

**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn’t change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.

Once you’ve been at these things for a while  you’ll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.

Hovering around 4 - 6:

If you’re at this stage  congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of  and if you did  it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you’ve reached this stage  your anxiety likely doesn’t manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally  but most of the time you’re able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You’ve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you’re still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition  though your physical symptoms may have eased up  your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here’s what you should do at this stage:

**1.** Keep staying the course. It’s easy to flounder or stop  and it’s okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also  don’t beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time  it’s part of what makes us human. And it’s okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work  things will get better.

**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you’ve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I’d find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this  I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations  but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up  and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren’t meant to be fun**. If you’ve got social anxiety and you’re challenging yourself by going to meet new people  it’ll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you’ll slowly notice improvement  and with time  it’ll become more and more natural over time.

**3.** Along the same lines  start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer  lift heavier weights. When you’re anxious  you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life  sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of “I’ve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two  why aren’t I seeing my anxiety improve?” And the answer in this case is because this person wasn’t pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things  you shouldn’t expect to see improvement.

**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included)  this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It’s okay to cave every once in a while at this stage  but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety  which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year  and my condition got much better as a result. If you’re seriously concerned about something  visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them  but once they diagnose you  do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types  sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find  but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you’re constantly sick or dying  yet doctors can’t find anything wrong  this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good)  but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn’t mean it’s true. 

**5.** Give it time. I’ve said it before but it’s important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months  so try your best to be patient. And remember  if things aren’t the way you want them to be now  they will be soon.

I think it’s also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**  which you may have come across in your book reading  as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience  but since that’s kind of vague  I’ll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words  you’re using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you’re someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself “that conversation was so awkward  so that person must think I’m a loser.” In this case  whether or not the situation was awkward  you don’t know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn’t see me that way  and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.

At this stage  I had the most trouble with mental symptoms  namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations  I always second guessed my own sanity  I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia  and anytime I was happy  I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy  so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you  it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist  therapists  family  and friends are correct when they say you’re not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety  or that you’re the one person out of the fifty who’s somehow figured out you’re losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn’t make it true**.

One of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery  it’s absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied  especially when you’re most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same  as they’re both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually  your mind will calm down on its own and you’ll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time  I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm  this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from  but once I did  I hit the next stage.

Anxiety is 1 - 3 most days  with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:

You’re in the home stretch. This is it. You’re likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you’ve done  but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you’ve come. For me  having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I’d ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously  if you’ve hit this point  the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it’s a little harder to deal with  let me reassure you: you’re almost home free.

Note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come  sometimes you’ll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack  but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don’t last more than a few seconds  and your symptoms don’t really illicit a response from you. At this stage:

**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you’ve clearly demonstrated they work. All that’s left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4  remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you’ll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. 

**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends  stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you’re still occasionally taking benzos  slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back  the more confident you’ll feel.

**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you’ve had anxiety and use what you’ve learned to stop worrying. For me  this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding  and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you’re able to ease  the better you’ll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would’ve never been able to do.

There really isn’t much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement  remind yourself of how well you’ve done so far and that there’s more to come.

Then finally…

No anxiety  with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:

That’s it. All the voices in your head telling you you’re not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don’t really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days  but most of the time you’re energetic  present  and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you’ve never had. It’s been a few months since you’ve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while  but you’re not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens  and that they’ll go away just as quickly as they came.

I don’t have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you’ll keep on doing it. 

Congratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.

My therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do  do the opposite. If it’s telling you not to get out of bed  do it. If it’s telling you not to go to a social event  do that. If it’s telling you you’re going to suffer from some grave illness  remind yourself that’s not true. If it’s telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help  don’t. If it’s telling you you’re losing your mind  remind yourself you’re not. Give it enough time  and eventually things will get better. 

**Summary:**

**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it’s just anxiety and can’t do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You’ve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**

**Don’t fight it. When you fight your anxiety  it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**

**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety  googling your symptoms  posting on this subreddit  writing in your journal  or just stewing in general  the worse off you’ll be. Cook  clean  dance  exercise  paint  draw  do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**

**Keep pushing the bounds of what you’re doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you’ve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it’ll only benefit you in the end.**

**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn’t make it true. You’ll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you’ve been dreading isn’t half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**

**Give it time. You’ll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**

Thank you for reading this. I really hope that  no matter where you’re at in life  you gained something from this. Please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful  or if there’s anything you want me to expand upon. I’ll try to respond to comments as best I can  but I work full time and don’t log into this account all that much  so I’m sorry if I don’t get to your comment as quickly as you’d like.

Edit: Sorry if the formatting is a little funky. 

Edit 2: Thank you guys for the overwhelmingly positive response! I've read all of your comments and am super happy ya'll found this helpful. I want to remind all of you who are currently going through bouts of anxiety that you absolutely will make it through and that you'll be a much better person for it. 

Keep in mind: anxiety does not define you. An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder  you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories  however small  you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make.

Good luck guys :)

Anxiety,I want to disappear a little,"This is the first time Im feeling this way.
Apparently I didn't tell anyone about that. I don't want anybody from my surrounding to worry because that's not so serious. I don't want to die at all. Still I feel that I need to discuss this with someone. Perhaps some of you had such experience and have thoughts to share.
to be more specific  I recently read a manga with a very banal scene where the character goes into the sea and just walks straight until the water covers him completely. What's strange is that for the first time I understood why people do this. It's one thing to understand with your head and quite another with your heart. All people understand that suicidal people want to escape from their lives  but now I really felt it  that death is a way out for them. Indeed.
And one more thing. I came across a poem.
Translated into English  a couple of lines from it sound approximately like this:
I was born so very long ago that now and then I feel
The green water passing over me  so real.
And I lie upon the river floor and from the water glean
A distant light  a towering home  a star's green ray  serene.
It stuck in my head. When I read it  I wanted more than anything in the world to be in that very water and serenely watch the flow of life from the outside. To be part of this world  but inanimate.

Anxiety,How I Overcame DPDR (symptoms  feedback loop  anxiety  my story  tips & advice),"Hi everyone  I really wanted to do/felt like I should make a separate master-post for how I overcame DPDR (depersonalization and derealization) that was triggered by long-term anxiety  as well as some of the symptoms  mechanisms of DPDR  feedback loop  triggers & more.

I made a previous master-post on my long-term anxiety symptoms (which I overcame) where I went over the more bizarre  rarely spoken about  constant symptoms of long-term anxiety  and the feedback loop and it seemed to help a lot of people. I will link that one below  I recommend everyone read it first!

https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/10jcfko/longterm_anxiety_symptoms_i_had_from_someone_who/

A lot of you wanted to know how I overcame the DP/DR symptoms. I didn't realise that I had message requests on Reddit  and now I've got so many spanning across months ago that I can't find the time to get back to individually so I feel like its my duty to make this post and have it all in one place. Warning  this is a big post.

Lets go over some positives first as I find its always best to get off on a positive note  and to have something to look forward to or motivate others:

**1. DP/DR (Depersonalization and Derealization) is not and is never permenant  anyone who says so are catastrophizing and are probably biased or feeling that way due to their own condition not improving. These notions are not helpful and are also not true.**

**It will and can go away 100%  it is not something you have to 'deal' with or 'accept' for the rest of your life.**


**2. DP/DR does not work like a debt system e.g. the longer you are in DP/DR  the longer it is going to take you to get out of it (isn't true!). Everyone has the same chance of success in recovering from DP/DR  no matter how long or short you have been in that state.**
**3. DP/DR is not indicative or a sign of psychosis  and you will not become psychotic if you experience DP/DR.**


DP/DR is a **defense mechanism**  which attempts to make sure that only the body experiences pain or trauma and not the mind  by causing detachment. **Causes of DP/DR can be anxiety attacks  severe stress  health anxiety  drug induced (often from edibles or hallucinogens)  traumatic first-hand or second-hand situations  abuse or any interpersonal trauma. Anyone of any age can experience DP/DR.**

.......................................................................

**What does DP/DR feel like?:**

- Everything feels (and looks) either too close or too far away from you  environments are distorted
- Everything feels flat or 2D  like it isn't quite real or tangible  others faces might feel unreal
- Can feel like the world is slipping away from you
- You might feel like you could fall over any second or fall through the floor
- Speech can feel slow/slurred  like your brain is struggling to find words
- Time can feel like its going too fast or too slow
- Feeling like you can observe yourself outside your body  everything feels disconnected  like you are very alone
- Your limbs can feel too small  too big  like you are taller or shorter than you actually are
- You might feel internally dizzy (like your mind is spinning but your vision isn't)  woozy head feelings  fuzzy head
- More frequent feelings of nostalgia/dejavu
- Colours can feel more dull or distorted
- Feeling numb  like your memories are less tangible or unreal
- Hypochondria (Healthy Anxiety) is often a huge comorbidity with DP/DR

.......................................................................

**The Feedback Loop  what is it?**

Symptoms of DP/DR (as well as Anxiety/Health Anxiety) are often kept alive by or started something called the **Feedback Loop.** This is a loop that is constantly being fed into  which could have started from something as for example:

*You may be minding your own business one day and suddenly experience a Panic Attack  but you misread it as being something worse. You could think you're about to die  that you are having a heart attack because of the palpitations  that you could collapse any moment now  and then it goes... but you're on edge  what if it happens again? Do I have a heart condition? I think I'm dying  I think something is wrong. Everyday you are waking up and checking if you can feel palpitations  you're scared it will happen again  you're getting waves of dread  your mind is full of 'what ifs' over and over again every single day. Then one day  nothing feels real and you feel completely detached from reality and this scares you even more  you feel like you're slipping away  you're terrified and feel like you'll never be normal again. You're waking up everyday to check if everything still feels unreal  and it does  its not going away. Whats happening?*


This is the **Feedback Loop** example which led to DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms. What should've happened when you experienced for example: a Panic Attack  was that **you should've been able to realise it was a Panic Attack and been able to ground yourself or calm down during that situation and it would go away. This would eliminate the start of the Feedback Loop**  but instead by misreading the situation or not having the appropriate tools to manage it  you are now in fear  in high stress and feeling traumatised of the situation in fear it will happen again or that something worse is happening to you. This keeps the Loop alive and going.

**In preparation for the pain or fear you are about to anticipate happening  your body chose to disassociate from your mind and cause DP/DR in order to handle the stress and fear of what you're afraid of experiencing. DP/DR is attempting to save you from what could happen to you next  after being activated from something that already hurt you or traumatised you.**

Identifying the first source of your DP/DR can be particularly important in understanding and learning where your Feedback Loop started. **For some people it can even extend to as far as childhood  which can sometimes result in something known as DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)**. Once you have identified the source  this is the stepping stone into recovering from DP/DR.

Sources of DPDR can be: drug-induced from hallucinogens/edibles/bad trips/alcohol or other substances  anxiety attacks  depression  stress  medical trauma/childhood trauma/adulthood trauma/being a child of divorce  sexual assaults/CSA  PTSD  DID and more

Environments are also very important to be recognised as sources of DPDR e.g. stressful jobs  stressful/abusive relationships  difficult home life  being a full-time carer for family  difficult school life etc

.......................................................................

**So what's going to help me get better?**

There's a lot of resources and therapies available for DP/DR  such as Psychotherapy (talking therapies)  CBT  DBT  EMDR and more.

But what is most important is that you are able to help yourself  as well as having professional support should you require it. **The thing that is going to get you better the most is you  and the tools you can develop to help you in time of need and in how you navigate the world and your trauma**. Some people (like me) may be able to recover from DP/DR without professional intervention or therapies  but it is always incredibly recommended if you have access or can afford it. **With DP/DR being highly trauma related  it is important to have a safe place to unload and traverse trauma with a professional**  as it can be tough to handle alone. **If you are concerned or suspect your DP/DR may be a result of DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)  professional help is absolutely necessary.**

Every person with DP/DR will be completely unique in their needs  what they can handle alone or what they need support with.

.......................................................................

**What can we do for ourselves?**

This is going to go over some self-practices and tools you can do in your own time to help yourself while actively experiencing DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms  and also how to reduce the chances of re-experiencing it when you are recovered.

**Staying Busy & Challenging Yourself:**

A big part of dissolving the Feedback Loop is by no longer feeding into it  and one way of doing this is by diverting our thoughts from the feelings of DP/DR or anxiety symptoms. **You want to find or make opportunities where you don't have time to think about DP/DR  or how it makes you feel  'scanning' for feelings or signs of it  and to challenge those feelings instead.**
**DP/DR and anxiety is the perfect time to get busy and involved with life**  whether it is your hobbies  being with your friends and family  doing chores that need to be done  starting things you've always wanted to do. **It can feel scary  even terrifying to partake in these things when you feel unreal  like you're not present or that the world is slipping away  but you must keep pushing through**. Once you begin to challenge yourself and challenge those feelings of 'not feeling real' you begin to establish trust within yourself.

**Don't be disheartened that DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms do not disappear right away overnight  this is because your body hormonally  needs time to acclimate to low levels of stress and anxiety after having been kept at such high levels. If these hormones were to plummet immediately  the body wouldn't be able to cope  so it likes to decline it gently! So consider it like you are establishing trust:**

DP/DR has been in the drivers seat all this time  and you've been the passenger in the back. You're finally insisting on being in the driver's seat  but DP/DR insists on being the passenger right next to you. DP/DR is going to freak out in the passenger seat and take the wheel from you at times during some tough situations because its not sure you can navigate it on your own  and instead of letting it take the driver's seat again you need to say to it  'Don't worry. I've got this'. and DP/DR will let go of the wheel. This in real life  would be an example of you handling the situation you are in and challenging yourself to face what makes you afraid (such as going outside in case you feel 'unreal').

**By doing this  you are establishing trust and are giving DP/DR the opportunity to know that you can handle the situation on your own. Eventually with time of practicing these things  DP/DR will get out of the car entirely and you can 'drive' all by yourself again and those feelings of DP/DR will be gone. You'll be able to live your life without things like anxiety or DP/DR dictacting where it takes you or how it makes you feel. You will have formed that trust that you can handle experiencing your pain  your fear  your trauma  your anxiety/stress etc. without the need of the defence mechanism of DP/DR. You will become the first line of defence!**

From personal experience this is what accelerated me to my complete recovery from DP/DR and long-term anxiety symptoms within 3-4 months of this practice after struggling for almost a year of non-stop DP/DR and anxiety symptoms. **I learned to empathise with my DP/DR's attempt at trying to keep me safe and acknowledged that it was only doing this in order to make me feel better  albeit in a scary and inconvenient way! So by learning techniques and also teaching myself not to be scared of DP/DR symptoms or my anxiety symptoms  I gave myself the opportunity to be the one in control and say ''Hey  I am totally capable of caring for myself now. Thank you for your help and what you tried to do for me'' to my DP/DR.**

By feeling afraid to participate in activities or doing things because you might feel unreal  or because the world feels distorted  you are allowing DP/DR to maintain control and are keeping DP/DR as an option

**Challenge yourself in incriments or in steps  and remember to reward yourself afterwards. Figure out what about DP/DR makes you afraid:**

**is it seeing people's faces? particularly friends or family?** - challenge yourself towards looking at faces  engaging with familiar faces (YouTubers  family  partners)  if you can touch their face then touch it  grounding exercises where you say ''I can see two eyes  they are [insert colour]  they have a [description] nose  do they have freckles? birth marks? do they have any smile lines? identify parts of their face and describe them'' this helps make them more tangible and less scary. Do little challenges before the bigger ones.

**is it going outside in case you feel unreal? woozy?** - challenge yourself towards small  short walks up and down your street  to eventually longer walks  acknowledge that you might be feeling dizzy/unreal but that you are safe  be kind & go home if you need it  try again another day  stay engaged with your hobbies/the outside world

**is it the feeling that you'll never be the same again? that you think its permenant? that you've ruined your life?** - The first thing you'll see if you look up 'can dpdr be permenant' is 'no!' and every other article will say no. There has never been an observed case of DPDR being permenant  and you won't be the first case of that happening. Its really important you do not entertain or engage with people who believe it is permenant  or that theirs is permenant because they are just people who are keeping their own DPDR alive with the negativity. I recommend writing positive affirmations or reading them  and engaging with positive stories of DPDR recovery and sticking with facts. **You have not ruined your life  and you will recover.**
**DPDR can make you feel afraid of lots of things  not just the ones I described above (but those are the most common).**

**Grounding Exercises:**
Grounding is a way to refocus and bring your attention back to the present and the world around you. This is can be used when experiencing fear or anxiety of your current DP/DR state  but is **most effective when you feel like it is 'coming on' or you are experiencing anxiety/stress that could lead to it.**

Grounding exercises can involve:

- Naming 5 things you can see  name 4 things you can touch and to touch them  naming 3 things you can hear and listening to them  what 2 things can you smell  1 thing you can taste.
- Holding ice cubes  putting your hands in cold water  picking up or touching things and explaining how it feels (is it cold  warm  does it feel rough or soft)  identifying their colours deeply
- Walks without music  tuning into the sounds of your steps  counting your steps  observing your surroundings on your walks  sitting in the grass and touching it.
- Mental anchoring by saying (in your head or quietly to yourself) your full name  your age  where you live  what street you live on  the date  where you are  what you're doing. Repeat this gently until you feel calm.
- Self-assurance phrases such as  ''You are okay''  ''Nothing can hurt me''  ''You will get through this''  ''I've done this once and I can do it again'' etc.

.......................................................................

**My Example of How I Personally Recovered from DPDR:**

For me I dealt with a lot of wooziness/dizziness during my DP/DR and I felt terrified to do anything sitting up or standing because I'd have to acknowledge that dizzy feeling and the unreal-ness from DP/DR  so I would lie on my side all day while watching TV or playing games instead to cope. **I wanted to turn 'Oh god  no I'm dizzy and woozy and nothing feels real  I'm so scared' into 'Oh I'm dizzy and feel unreal today? Lets see what I can manage'.**

It started to become more of 'Let's get up! Lets engage with the same hobbies but lets sit up this time'. I'd do that for as long as I feel I could handle the dizzines and unreal sensations  and then I'd lie back down again. I rewarded myself and cared for myself with a technique that brought me comfort  while having succeeded in engaging with something that scared me or was difficult. Over time I'd start to sit up for longer  or I'd start to go outside on short walks (which was particularly hard as I'd feel more unreal outside than at home)  and I would feel unreal  like everything was flat  like the world was slipping away but I did it.

Some days I would just cry or feel like I took steps back  that I'd be stuck forever but I kept going and I kept rewarding myself after those times with either little lie downs  eating things I really loved  engaging in self-care or watching familiar TV shows I know I loved. Over time I started to sit up a lot more  I started to stand more  I started to go out more and for much  much longer each time  I started to do all the things I loved again despite how I felt. **Don't get me wrong  I still felt unreal and dizzy but I wanted to stop being scared of it and to not let it stop me engaging with things I loved or wanted to do.**

**I stopped basing my days and thoughts on 'how good I'm feeling' and more so on 'how well can I manage today'.** That took away a lot of pressure for me  as I knew I would not feel better over night but I would learn to manage my days better  so focusing on that intrinsically helped me feel better. You'll want to learn how to manage bad days (whether DPDR days  anxious days  stressful days) because when you do  you'll become prepared for if you ever face any of those times again and you can conquer it!

One day after months of challenging myself  being more present  doing my hobbies  going outside (I remember this vividly) I was hugging my partner and I looked up at his face and I physically jumped  **he looked real. I started looking around everywhere and everything felt real  everything looked so colorful  the world didn't feel flat or distorted  everything felt 'real' and 'right' and when I touched my partner's face it felt so tangible and real.** I don't think I've ever cried that hard in my life from happiness  my DPDR was gone.

Everything probably felt like this for a while  but because I was so engrossed in engaging with the world around me and doing the things I loved I didn't actually realise it  because I was no longer questioning my reality or looking for signs of DP/DR. **So that one moment where I finally remembered to 'check' my reality  it made me realise everything felt real again and that I felt human again. And it never came back.**

When you feel ready  the key is to be kind to yourself as well as challenge yourself against your DPDR and how it makes you feel. By pushing through and engaging with the world around you bit by bit you will start to establish that trust  those tools  in convincing your body that you can handle yourself and that it no longer needs to detach with DPDR to keep you safe.

.......................................................................

**Some habits to get into  and some to get rid of:**

- **Cut out all alcohol and all drugs absolutely and completely  as well as caffeine & reduce or quit smoking.** All of these substances will have an effect on the hormones in your body  and can impede progress from DP/DR due to the sensations it can produce and will generally stress out the body  and mind-altering drugs like hallucinogens or Cannabis can worsen DP/DR greatly or keep it around. *If you are an addict or suffer from addictions  get in touch with services that can help you taper  detox or navigate potential sobriety  do not attempt any of this alone.*

- **Establish a normal bedtime routine**  ideally getting into bed at 9-10pm and waking up before 9am. Some people need more sleep than others so wake up at whatever time in the morning before 9am is best for you; getting adequate sleep will greatly improve the rate of which your DP/DR can dissolve as your mind will be most lucid  alert and prepared to handle potential stressors. **Sleeping too much or too little can greatly affect your brain and hormone regulation  and you need the best hormone regulation in order for the body to lower cortisol levels which leads to DP/DR symptoms rapidly improving.**

- **Stay hydrated and well-fed.** This is really typical mental health advice  but in general you will want to make sure you are hydrated and well-fed so the body has enough energy supply to handle stressors  anxiety and to ensure the mind is as lucid and energised as possible. You will need all the energy you can possibly get  and having these bases covered can really improve your symptoms.

- **Get checked for any Vitamin Deficiencies** as a lot of Vitamins we can be deficient in will greatly effect circadian rhythms  heart rhythms  the brain (deficiencies can cause brain fog  low motor skill function and poor hormone regulation). **Making sure we have healthy  functioning foundations to work off of greatly supports mental function and our ability to take on new information and learn new things (such as therapeutic tools and treatment).**

- **Identify your stressors and reduce them  identify your triggers and navigate them.** Cortisol levels increase with stress (from stressors) and anxiety  when we are faced with high levels of cortisol for extended periods of time  the body can produce bizzare and scary symptoms (which are harmless).

For small context of my story  I developed random Agoraphobia in late 2019  which escalated into very bad health anxiety through all of 2020 and some of 2021  all because of one singular panic attack. One panic attack that I misread for something serious  turned into a feedback loop of anxiety which ended up producing very scary  bizzare  and difficult symptoms. I have been free of these symptoms for what will have been over a year now as of this year after tackling my anxiety  and I'd love to help all of you feel at ease if you have any of these!

You don't have to be actively panicking or anxious to experience these  your body holds onto long-term built up anxiety/stress  it doesn't flush it all out immediately so you can experience these anytime after prolonged periods of these emotions. It gets much  much better over time.

- Dizziness (like the inside of your head is spinning but your vision isn't  sometimes to the point where you can't sit up or if you close your eyes it feels like you're spinning)

- Fuzzy Strange Head Feeling  wooziness  heaviness in the head
- Like the ground feels wobbly/like you'll fall over/like you're on a boat  like I'd fall through the floor

- Brain Zaps (without the presence of SSRI's. It'd feel like an elevator dropped inside my head  my head would 'zing' a lot  sometimes my vision would black out  my head would drop  I thought only SSRI withdrawal could do this but I found out thats not the case. I felt crazy.)

- Head Pressure or headaches (extreme pressure headaches that felt like it was constantly expanding  like I wanted to squeeze my head  so much pain  sharp pain  tension)

- Electricity feeling in the back of the neck at the base of the head (made me think I had MS)

- Derealization/Depersonalization (everything felt either too close or too far away  like everything wasn't real  looking at people felt like they were 2D cut-outs  nothing felt real or right  like the world was slipping away  this was my scariest symptom and worried it was permenant. I've never experienced it again since 2020  and I feel like my old self again)
**Edit 27th September 2023: I have finally made a big post on my DPDR recovery story  as well as advice  symptoms  reassuring facts/advice** https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/16thenk/how_i_overcame_dpdr_symptoms_feedback_loop/?

- Choking/Strangling Sensation in the throat or around the throat/gagging/globus sensation/neck tightness or stiffness

- Increased Phosphene Activity (for example  when you rub your eyes or press on closed eyes you see 'fireworks' or 'lights'  I'd see them much more at night with my eyes closed trying to sleep  and they'd sometimes make shapes or patterns)

- Hypnagogic/Hypnapompic Hallucinations (not indicative of psychosis  normal phenomenon  its when you see afterimages at night just before sleeping or the second you wake up. I'd sometimes have a digital alarm clock afterimage stuck in my vision for a minute)

- Strange pulsing light around field of vision at night after opening eyes

- Increase in Afterimages (they've severely decreased since getting better/I don't notice if I have any anymore. I used to focus on them like crazy)

- Visual Snow (had it all my life  but it felt 'increased' during my anxiety. Truth is I was just focusing on it more and now I never notice it again)

- Random black dot in vision  disappears when I look at it (I don't get this at all anymore but it used to be constant)

- Tinnitus (again  had all my life but was 'worse' during my extreme anxiety. Its since got better greatly since I felt better)

- Floaters in vision (I don't get these but these are extraordinarily common in people with anxiety)

- Chest Tightness  Chest Pain  Ectopic Beats  Palpitations  Tingling in hands

- Feeling Hungry for Air  like you can't get a full satisfying breath  shortness of breath sensation

- Sleep Paralysis Increase

- Lots of random pain  soreness in any part of the body suddenly  ranges from sharp to dull  just always in pain one way or another (I'd get zygomatic pain  to my neck being tender)

- Tense jaw  like it couldn't relax

- Stomach pain  stomach upsetness  nausea  bowel urgency

- Feeling like your speech is slurred  slow or like your brain is lagging

- Increased Vivid dreams  hyperawareness of sleep sensations (such as racing train of thought  nonsense thoughts as your brain winds down for sleep)  hypnic jerks

- Eye Pain/eye pressure  pain moving eyes around  pain in the socket

- Random feelings of dread  feeling like you are about to die/something is wrong

These are just some of the symptoms I remember off the top of my head  definitely leave comments if there's any you're experiencing that I haven't noted as I can also try to let you know if I had those symptoms  or if other Redditors have!

It took me longer than I'd like to admit that these are just symptoms of anxiety and not something greater; I was a non-stop Googler of every symptom and sensation and decided I had every disease under the sun like Meniere's Disease  MS  brain tumours  schizophrenia (even though I had absolutely no symptoms of it) etc. I felt like I was going to be like this forever  it affected me everyday of my waking life  I kept a diary everyday of my symptoms and how I felt until one day I never wrote in it again because I never had anything to write about. I got better  it gets better  you are all safe  you are not alone.

I'd be super happy to answer any questions  or to help any of you feel assured so please feel free to leave anything by that could get you the help or support you need.

**Edit (27th September 2023)**

**I have made a large post like this one  about my recovery from DPDR and how I managed it. I had a lot of questions and message requests based on this symptom alone and how I combatted it  but I'm struggling to reply individually to so many messages about it  so here it is:**

https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/16thenk/how_i_overcame_dpdr_symptoms_feedback_loop/?

**Please give that post a look if you are curious about DPDR recovery  its symptoms  how it can start and some reassuring advice on it**

........................................................

**Edit 2 (17th January 2024)**
Hiya everyone!

I just wanted to say thank you so much to all of you who are still using this place as a resource  and a safe place to come to me for advice and reassurance!

**For future reference I'd really recommend that if any of you have questions  or need advice  that you reply to this thread instead of sending me private messages and I'll explain why!**

1. Its easier & faster for me to get back to you! When you make a comment I get a notification which allows me to see your concerns instantly. **When a private message is sent  it immediately goes into my 'Message Requests' which I never get a notification for and have to actively remember to check it everyday (which can be hard!). I've got over 40 message requests now  which has left me quite swamped and feeling helpless because I didn't see them sooner and don't know where to start/if I can. So I'd really recommend at least leaving a comment first in the thread before messaging me privately. I want to help!**

2. Leaving a comment means that other people can read your questions  and they can also read my answers! This allows people to find answers to their questions easier as they may have the same question in their minds that has been asked before  and they can find that its been asked & answered. This stops a flood of repeat questions  and allows public access of all the information and experiences I can provide. **It is absolutely imperative to me that all of the information  advice and questions here remain completely public  free of charge and can be revisitable.**

3. **I can understand some of what you may want to talk about is more private/personal  so in this case please leave a comment requesting to message me and allow me to give you permission to message me before you send a private message.** This allows me to remember to check my message requests  and confirms that I can give you the attention and shoulder to lean on that you may need. There are times I will be absent due to personal commitments and real life  so I want to be able to reassure you on when I have the time to get back to you.

Again  I just wanted to say thank you and that I am insanely grateful for and proud of everyone here. I hope you know this is written in good faith and not to shame anybody  **I just want to help all of you as much as I can so making it easier to navigate and accessible means that more people can get the help they need x**",548,549,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/10jcfko/longterm_anxiety_symptoms_i_had_from_someone_who/
Anxiety,I want to disappear,"I’m literally just trying to work. I have anxiety and I’ve just sat here in the office and mind my own busines. Then this guy  we’ll call him bob comes over and starts talkin. (Oh boy…) he starts talking about how there’s food in the office and everyone’s eatin. All good right? Right?

Until he literally made the comment that “I forget that your here  everyone forgets that your here.”they had offered me a sandwich and I walked over to get it while I was on the verge of tears. I thank the one who made it and hurry back to the other end of the office where my eyes fill more with tears as I rapidly dab them away. At this point my nose is running and I’m hoping I can just go home soon and just pass away.

Anxiety,Does anyone else’s anxiety make everything hurt physically? ,I’ve had depression and anxiety most of my life  but the last few weeks have been unusually terrible.

Everything hurts  my back  my neck  my chest. Not overwhelming pain  just unusual and persistent enough to be annoying  things ache that have never ached before. Ibuprofen does nothing  muscle relaxers do nothing  I feel super tense just about everywhere. My entire body feels like a mildly pulled muscle. Has anyone else experienced this during extra stressful times? It’s hard not to worry about it  and I’m trying to avoid ending up in the ER just to hear “you’re exhausted  go home and relax”. ,6,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gx43m9/does_anyone_elses_anxiety_make_everything_hurt/
Anxiety,What is an intrusive thought you once thought was terrifying but now looking back is hilarious?,"As someone with anxiety  I often get hit with random  scary thoughts out of nowhere.

Or when I’m driving and stop at a crosswalk  I might think about hitting the gas and running someone over. It scares me so much that I’ll double-check the brakes and gear to make sure everything’s fine.

Sometimes  if someone’s crouched down with their back to me  I’ll think about kicking them. These thoughts are super irrational and terrifying at the moment  but they cause a lot of anxiety.

Looking back now  I can see how absurd these thoughts were and even laugh at how ridiculous they sound.

Right now I’m having like flu like pains all over my body. I’m gonna talk to my pcp about it though I’ve already been tested for various things (such as arthritis and lupus) and I doubt that it’s anything.

Anxiety,How I Overcame DPDR (symptoms  feedback loop  anxiety  my story  tips & advice),"Hi everyone  I really wanted to do/felt like I should make a separate master-post for how I overcame DPDR (depersonalization and derealization) that was triggered by long-term anxiety  as well as some of the symptoms  mechanisms of DPDR  feedback loop  triggers & more.

I made a previous master-post on my long-term anxiety symptoms (which I overcame) where I went over the more bizarre  rarely spoken about  constant symptoms of long-term anxiety  and the feedback loop and it seemed to help a lot of people. I will link that one below  I recommend everyone read it first!

https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/10jcfko/longterm_anxiety_symptoms_i_had_from_someone_who/

A lot of you wanted to know how I overcame the DP/DR symptoms. I didn't realise that I had message requests on Reddit  and now I've got so many spanning across months ago that I can't find the time to get back to individually so I feel like its my duty to make this post and have it all in one place. Warning  this is a big post.

Lets go over some positives first as I find its always best to get off on a positive note  and to have something to look forward to or motivate others:

**1. DP/DR (Depersonalization and Derealization) is not and is never permenant  anyone who says so are catastrophizing and are probably biased or feeling that way due to their own condition not improving. These notions are not helpful and are also not true.**

**It will and can go away 100%  it is not something you have to 'deal' with or 'accept' for the rest of your life.**


**2. DP/DR does not work like a debt system e.g. the longer you are in DP/DR  the longer it is going to take you to get out of it (isn't true!). Everyone has the same chance of success in recovering from DP/DR  no matter how long or short you have been in that state.**
**3. DP/DR is not indicative or a sign of psychosis  and you will not become psychotic if you experience DP/DR.**


DP/DR is a **defense mechanism**  which attempts to make sure that only the body experiences pain or trauma and not the mind  by causing detachment. **Causes of DP/DR can be anxiety attacks  severe stress  health anxiety  drug induced (often from edibles or hallucinogens)  traumatic first-hand or second-hand situations  abuse or any interpersonal trauma. Anyone of any age can experience DP/DR.**

.......................................................................

**What does DP/DR feel like?:**

- Everything feels (and looks) either too close or too far away from you  environments are distorted
- Everything feels flat or 2D  like it isn't quite real or tangible  others faces might feel unreal
- Can feel like the world is slipping away from you
- You might feel like you could fall over any second or fall through the floor
- Speech can feel slow/slurred  like your brain is struggling to find words
- Time can feel like its going too fast or too slow
- Feeling like you can observe yourself outside your body  everything feels disconnected  like you are very alone
- Your limbs can feel too small  too big  like you are taller or shorter than you actually are
- You might feel internally dizzy (like your mind is spinning but your vision isn't)  woozy head feelings  fuzzy head
- More frequent feelings of nostalgia/dejavu
- Colours can feel more dull or distorted
- Feeling numb  like your memories are less tangible or unreal
- Hypochondria (Healthy Anxiety) is often a huge comorbidity with DP/DR

.......................................................................

**The Feedback Loop  what is it?**

Symptoms of DP/DR (as well as Anxiety/Health Anxiety) are often kept alive by or started something called the **Feedback Loop.** This is a loop that is constantly being fed into  which could have started from something as for example:

*You may be minding your own business one day and suddenly experience a Panic Attack  but you misread it as being something worse. You could think you're about to die  that you are having a heart attack because of the palpitations  that you could collapse any moment now  and then it goes... but you're on edge  what if it happens again? Do I have a heart condition? I think I'm dying  I think something is wrong. Everyday you are waking up and checking if you can feel palpitations  you're scared it will happen again  you're getting waves of dread  your mind is full of 'what ifs' over and over again every single day. Then one day  nothing feels real and you feel completely detached from reality and this scares you even more  you feel like you're slipping away  you're terrified and feel like you'll never be normal again. You're waking up everyday to check if everything still feels unreal  and it does  its not going away. Whats happening?*


This is the **Feedback Loop** example which led to DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms. What should've happened when you experienced for example: a Panic Attack  was that **you should've been able to realise it was a Panic Attack and been able to ground yourself or calm down during that situation and it would go away. This would eliminate the start of the Feedback Loop**  but instead by misreading the situation or not having the appropriate tools to manage it  you are now in fear  in high stress and feeling traumatised of the situation in fear it will happen again or that something worse is happening to you. This keeps the Loop alive and going.

**In preparation for the pain or fear you are about to anticipate happening  your body chose to disassociate from your mind and cause DP/DR in order to handle the stress and fear of what you're afraid of experiencing. DP/DR is attempting to save you from what could happen to you next  after being activated from something that already hurt you or traumatised you.**

Identifying the first source of your DP/DR can be particularly important in understanding and learning where your Feedback Loop started. **For some people it can even extend to as far as childhood  which can sometimes result in something known as DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)**. Once you have identified the source  this is the stepping stone into recovering from DP/DR.

Sources of DPDR can be: drug-induced from hallucinogens/edibles/bad trips/alcohol or other substances  anxiety attacks  depression  stress  medical trauma/childhood trauma/adulthood trauma/being a child of divorce  sexual assaults/CSA  PTSD  DID and more

Environments are also very important to be recognised as sources of DPDR e.g. stressful jobs  stressful/abusive relationships  difficult home life  being a full-time carer for family  difficult school life etc

.......................................................................

**So what's going to help me get better?**

There's a lot of resources and therapies available for DP/DR  such as Psychotherapy (talking therapies)  CBT  DBT  EMDR and more.

But what is most important is that you are able to help yourself  as well as having professional support should you require it. **The thing that is going to get you better the most is you  and the tools you can develop to help you in time of need and in how you navigate the world and your trauma**. Some people (like me) may be able to recover from DP/DR without professional intervention or therapies  but it is always incredibly recommended if you have access or can afford it. **With DP/DR being highly trauma related  it is important to have a safe place to unload and traverse trauma with a professional**  as it can be tough to handle alone. **If you are concerned or suspect your DP/DR may be a result of DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)  professional help is absolutely necessary.**

Every person with DP/DR will be completely unique in their needs  what they can handle alone or what they need support with.

.......................................................................

**What can we do for ourselves?**

This is going to go over some self-practices and tools you can do in your own time to help yourself while actively experiencing DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms  and also how to reduce the chances of re-experiencing it when you are recovered.

**Staying Busy & Challenging Yourself:**

A big part of dissolving the Feedback Loop is by no longer feeding into it  and one way of doing this is by diverting our thoughts from the feelings of DP/DR or anxiety symptoms. **You want to find or make opportunities where you don't have time to think about DP/DR  or how it makes you feel  'scanning' for feelings or signs of it  and to challenge those feelings instead.**
**DP/DR and anxiety is the perfect time to get busy and involved with life**  whether it is your hobbies  being with your friends and family  doing chores that need to be done  starting things you've always wanted to do. **It can feel scary  even terrifying to partake in these things when you feel unreal  like you're not present or that the world is slipping away  but you must keep pushing through**. Once you begin to challenge yourself and challenge those feelings of 'not feeling real' you begin to establish trust within yourself.

**Don't be disheartened that DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms do not disappear right away overnight  this is because your body hormonally  needs time to acclimate to low levels of stress and anxiety after having been kept at such high levels. If these hormones were to plummet immediately  the body wouldn't be able to cope  so it likes to decline it gently! So consider it like you are establishing trust:**

DP/DR has been in the drivers seat all this time  and you've been the passenger in the back. You're finally insisting on being in the driver's seat  but DP/DR insists on being the passenger right next to you. DP/DR is going to freak out in the passenger seat and take the wheel from you at times during some tough situations because its not sure you can navigate it on your own  and instead of letting it take the driver's seat again you need to say to it  'Don't worry. I've got this'. and DP/DR will let go of the wheel. This in real life  would be an example of you handling the situation you are in and challenging yourself to face what makes you afraid (such as going outside in case you feel 'unreal').

**By doing this  you are establishing trust and are giving DP/DR the opportunity to know that you can handle the situation on your own. Eventually with time of practicing these things  DP/DR will get out of the car entirely and you can 'drive' all by yourself again and those feelings of DP/DR will be gone. You'll be able to live your life without things like anxiety or DP/DR dictacting where it takes you or how it makes you feel. You will have formed that trust that you can handle experiencing your pain  your fear  your trauma  your anxiety/stress etc. without the need of the defence mechanism of DP/DR. You will become the first line of defence!**

From personal experience this is what accelerated me to my complete recovery from DP/DR and long-term anxiety symptoms within 3-4 months of this practice after struggling for almost a year of non-stop DP/DR and anxiety symptoms. **I learned to empathise with my DP/DR's attempt at trying to keep me safe and acknowledged that it was only doing this in order to make me feel better  albeit in a scary and inconvenient way! So by learning techniques and also teaching myself not to be scared of DP/DR symptoms or my anxiety symptoms  I gave myself the opportunity to be the one in control and say ''Hey  I am totally capable of caring for myself now. Thank you for your help and what you tried to do for me'' to my DP/DR.**

By feeling afraid to participate in activities or doing things because you might feel unreal  or because the world feels distorted  you are allowing DP/DR to maintain control and are keeping DP/DR as an option

**Challenge yourself in incriments or in steps  and remember to reward yourself afterwards. Figure out what about DP/DR makes you afraid:**

**is it seeing people's faces? particularly friends or family?** - challenge yourself towards looking at faces  engaging with familiar faces (YouTubers  family  partners)  if you can touch their face then touch it  grounding exercises where you say ''I can see two eyes  they are [insert colour]  they have a [description] nose  do they have freckles? birth marks? do they have any smile lines? identify parts of their face and describe them'' this helps make them more tangible and less scary. Do little challenges before the bigger ones.

**is it going outside in case you feel unreal? woozy?** - challenge yourself towards small  short walks up and down your street  to eventually longer walks  acknowledge that you might be feeling dizzy/unreal but that you are safe  be kind & go home if you need it  try again another day  stay engaged with your hobbies/the outside world

**is it the feeling that you'll never be the same again? that you think its permenant? that you've ruined your life?** - The first thing you'll see if you look up 'can dpdr be permenant' is 'no!' and every other article will say no. There has never been an observed case of DPDR being permenant  and you won't be the first case of that happening. Its really important you do not entertain or engage with people who believe it is permenant  or that theirs is permenant because they are just people who are keeping their own DPDR alive with the negativity. I recommend writing positive affirmations or reading them  and engaging with positive stories of DPDR recovery and sticking with facts. **You have not ruined your life  and you will recover.**
**DPDR can make you feel afraid of lots of things  not just the ones I described above (but those are the most common).**

**Grounding Exercises:**
Grounding is a way to refocus and bring your attention back to the present and the world around you. This is can be used when experiencing fear or anxiety of your current DP/DR state  but is **most effective when you feel like it is 'coming on' or you are experiencing anxiety/stress that could lead to it.**

Grounding exercises can involve:

- Naming 5 things you can see  name 4 things you can touch and to touch them  naming 3 things you can hear and listening to them  what 2 things can you smell  1 thing you can taste.
- Holding ice cubes  putting your hands in cold water  picking up or touching things and explaining how it feels (is it cold  warm  does it feel rough or soft)  identifying their colours deeply
- Walks without music  tuning into the sounds of your steps  counting your steps  observing your surroundings on your walks  sitting in the grass and touching it.
- Mental anchoring by saying (in your head or quietly to yourself) your full name  your age  where you live  what street you live on  the date  where you are  what you're doing. Repeat this gently until you feel calm.
- Self-assurance phrases such as  ''You are okay''  ''Nothing can hurt me''  ''You will get through this''  ''I've done this once and I can do it again'' etc.

.......................................................................

**My Example of How I Personally Recovered from DPDR:**

For me I dealt with a lot of wooziness/dizziness during my DP/DR and I felt terrified to do anything sitting up or standing because I'd have to acknowledge that dizzy feeling and the unreal-ness from DP/DR  so I would lie on my side all day while watching TV or playing games instead to cope. **I wanted to turn 'Oh god  no I'm dizzy and woozy and nothing feels real  I'm so scared' into 'Oh I'm dizzy and feel unreal today? Lets see what I can manage'.**

It started to become more of 'Let's get up! Lets engage with the same hobbies but lets sit up this time'. I'd do that for as long as I feel I could handle the dizzines and unreal sensations  and then I'd lie back down again. I rewarded myself and cared for myself with a technique that brought me comfort  while having succeeded in engaging with something that scared me or was difficult. Over time I'd start to sit up for longer  or I'd start to go outside on short walks (which was particularly hard as I'd feel more unreal outside than at home)  and I would feel unreal  like everything was flat  like the world was slipping away but I did it.

Some days I would just cry or feel like I took steps back  that I'd be stuck forever but I kept going and I kept rewarding myself after those times with either little lie downs  eating things I really loved  engaging in self-care or watching familiar TV shows I know I loved. Over time I started to sit up a lot more  I started to stand more  I started to go out more and for much  much longer each time  I started to do all the things I loved again despite how I felt. **Don't get me wrong  I still felt unreal and dizzy but I wanted to stop being scared of it and to not let it stop me engaging with things I loved or wanted to do.**

**I stopped basing my days and thoughts on 'how good I'm feeling' and more so on 'how well can I manage today'.** That took away a lot of pressure for me  as I knew I would not feel better over night but I would learn to manage my days better  so focusing on that intrinsically helped me feel better. You'll want to learn how to manage bad days (whether DPDR days  anxious days  stressful days) because when you do  you'll become prepared for if you ever face any of those times again and you can conquer it!

One day after months of challenging myself  being more present  doing my hobbies  going outside (I remember this vividly) I was hugging my partner and I looked up at his face and I physically jumped  **he looked real. I started looking around everywhere and everything felt real  everything looked so colorful  the world didn't feel flat or distorted  everything felt 'real' and 'right' and when I touched my partner's face it felt so tangible and real.** I don't think I've ever cried that hard in my life from happiness  my DPDR was gone.

Everything probably felt like this for a while  but because I was so engrossed in engaging with the world around me and doing the things I loved I didn't actually realise it  because I was no longer questioning my reality or looking for signs of DP/DR. **So that one moment where I finally remembered to 'check' my reality  it made me realise everything felt real again and that I felt human again. And it never came back.**

When you feel ready  the key is to be kind to yourself as well as challenge yourself against your DPDR and how it makes you feel. By pushing through and engaging with the world around you bit by bit you will start to establish that trust  those tools  in convincing your body that you can handle yourself and that it no longer needs to detach with DPDR to keep you safe.

.......................................................................

**Some habits to get into  and some to get rid of:**

- **Cut out all alcohol and all drugs absolutely and completely  as well as caffeine & reduce or quit smoking.** All of these substances will have an effect on the hormones in your body  and can impede progress from DP/DR due to the sensations it can produce and will generally stress out the body  and mind-altering drugs like hallucinogens or Cannabis can worsen DP/DR greatly or keep it around. *If you are an addict or suffer from addictions  get in touch with services that can help you taper  detox or navigate potential sobriety  do not attempt any of this alone.*

- **Establish a normal bedtime routine**  ideally getting into bed at 9-10pm and waking up before 9am. Some people need more sleep than others so wake up at whatever time in the morning before 9am is best for you; getting adequate sleep will greatly improve the rate of which your DP/DR can dissolve as your mind will be most lucid  alert and prepared to handle potential stressors. **Sleeping too much or too little can greatly affect your brain and hormone regulation  and you need the best hormone regulation in order for the body to lower cortisol levels which leads to DP/DR symptoms rapidly improving.**

- **Stay hydrated and well-fed.** This is really typical mental health advice  but in general you will want to make sure you are hydrated and well-fed so the body has enough energy supply to handle stressors  anxiety and to ensure the mind is as lucid and energised as possible. You will need all the energy you can possibly get  and having these bases covered can really improve your symptoms.

- **Get checked for any Vitamin Deficiencies** as a lot of Vitamins we can be deficient in will greatly effect circadian rhythms  heart rhythms  the brain (deficiencies can cause brain fog  low motor skill function and poor hormone regulation). **Making sure we have healthy  functioning foundations to work off of greatly supports mental function and our ability to take on new information and learn new things (such as therapeutic tools and treatment).**

- **Identify your stressors and reduce them  identify your triggers and navigate them.** Cortisol levels increase with stress (from stressors) and anxiety  when we are faced with high levels of cortisol for extended periods of time  the body can produce bizzare and scary symptoms (which are harmless).

Anxiety,Long-Term Anxiety Symptoms I Had! (from someone who has recovered/been free from them for 1+ year),"Long-Term Anxiety/Long-term Stress Symptoms
I wanted to make a post in hopes to help a lot of you who are experiencing very strange  scary and difficult symptoms that you may not realise are a product of long-term and cyclical anxiety/health anxiety/stress. I felt inspired to make this post as even to this day  I am getting comments and messages on some of my previous posts about how I've made people feel better  less afraid and less alone as I've made their symptoms feel heard and like they are finally feeling safe and that what they are experiencing won't hurt them.

For small context of my story  I developed random Agoraphobia in late 2019  which escalated into very bad health anxiety through all of 2020 and some of 2021  all because of one singular panic attack. One panic attack that I misread for something serious  turned into a feedback loop of anxiety which ended up producing very scary  bizzare  and difficult symptoms. I have been free of these symptoms for what will have been over a year now as of this year after tackling my anxiety  and I'd love to help all of you feel at ease if you have any of these!

You don't have to be actively panicking or anxious to experience these  your body holds onto long-term built up anxiety/stress  it doesn't flush it all out immediately so you can experience these anytime after prolonged periods of these emotions. It gets much  much better over time.

- Dizziness (like the inside of your head is spinning but your vision isn't  sometimes to the point where you can't sit up or if you close your eyes it feels like you're spinning)

- Fuzzy Strange Head Feeling  wooziness  heaviness in the head
- Like the ground feels wobbly/like you'll fall over/like you're on a boat  like I'd fall through the floor

- Brain Zaps (without the presence of SSRI's. It'd feel like an elevator dropped inside my head  my head would 'zing' a lot  sometimes my vision would black out  my head would drop  I thought only SSRI withdrawal could do this but I found out thats not the case. I felt crazy.)

- Head Pressure or headaches (extreme pressure headaches that felt like it was constantly expanding  like I wanted to squeeze my head  so much pain  sharp pain  tension)

- Electricity feeling in the back of the neck at the base of the head (made me think I had MS)

- Derealization/Depersonalization (everything felt either too close or too far away  like everything wasn't real  looking at people felt like they were 2D cut-outs  nothing felt real or right  like the world was slipping away  this was my scariest symptom and worried it was permenant. I've never experienced it again since 2020  and I feel like my old self again)
**Edit 27th September 2023: I have finally made a big post on my DPDR recovery story  as well as advice  symptoms  reassuring facts/advice** https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/16thenk/how_i_overcame_dpdr_symptoms_feedback_loop/?

- Choking/Strangling Sensation in the throat or around the throat/gagging/globus sensation/neck tightness or stiffness

- Increased Phosphene Activity (for example  when you rub your eyes or press on closed eyes you see 'fireworks' or 'lights'  I'd see them much more at night with my eyes closed trying to sleep  and they'd sometimes make shapes or patterns)

- Hypnagogic/Hypnapompic Hallucinations (not indicative of psychosis  normal phenomenon  its when you see afterimages at night just before sleeping or the second you wake up. I'd sometimes have a digital alarm clock afterimage stuck in my vision for a minute)

- Strange pulsing light around field of vision at night after opening eyes

- Increase in Afterimages (they've severely decreased since getting better/I don't notice if I have any anymore. I used to focus on them like crazy)

- Visual Snow (had it all my life  but it felt 'increased' during my anxiety. Truth is I was just focusing on it more and now I never notice it again)

- Random black dot in vision  disappears when I look at it (I don't get this at all anymore but it used to be constant)

- Tinnitus (again  had all my life but was 'worse' during my extreme anxiety. Its since got better greatly since I felt better)

- Floaters in vision (I don't get these but these are extraordinarily common in people with anxiety)

- Chest Tightness  Chest Pain  Ectopic Beats  Palpitations  Tingling in hands

- Feeling Hungry for Air  like you can't get a full satisfying breath  shortness of breath sensation

- Sleep Paralysis Increase

- Lots of random pain  soreness in any part of the body suddenly  ranges from sharp to dull  just always in pain one way or another (I'd get zygomatic pain  to my neck being tender)

- Tense jaw  like it couldn't relax

- Stomach pain  stomach upsetness  nausea  bowel urgency

- Feeling like your speech is slurred  slow or like your brain is lagging

- Increased Vivid dreams  hyperawareness of sleep sensations (such as racing train of thought  nonsense thoughts as your brain winds down for sleep)  hypnic jerks

- Eye Pain/eye pressure  pain moving eyes around  pain in the socket

- Random feelings of dread  feeling like you are about to die/something is wrong

These are just some of the symptoms I remember off the top of my head  definitely leave comments if there's any you're experiencing that I haven't noted as I can also try to let you know if I had those symptoms  or if other Redditors have!

It took me longer than I'd like to admit that these are just symptoms of anxiety and not something greater; I was a non-stop Googler of every symptom and sensation and decided I had every disease under the sun like Meniere's Disease  MS  brain tumours  schizophrenia (even though I had absolutely no symptoms of it) etc. I felt like I was going to be like this forever  it affected me everyday of my waking life  I kept a diary everyday of my symptoms and how I felt until one day I never wrote in it again because I never had anything to write about. I got better  it gets better  you are all safe  you are not alone.

I'd be super happy to answer any questions  or to help any of you feel assured so please feel free to leave anything by that could get you the help or support you need.

**Edit (27th September 2023)**

**I have made a large post like this one  about my recovery from DPDR and how I managed it. I had a lot of questions and message requests based on this symptom alone and how I combatted it  but I'm struggling to reply individually to so many messages about it  so here it is:**

**Please give that post a look if you are curious about DPDR recovery  its symptoms  how it can start and some reassuring advice on it**

........................................................

**Edit 2 (17th January 2024)**
Hiya everyone!

I just wanted to say thank you so much to all of you who are still using this place as a resource  and a safe place to come to me for advice and reassurance!

**For future reference I'd really recommend that if any of you have questions  or need advice  that you reply to this thread instead of sending me private messages and I'll explain why!**

1. Its easier & faster for me to get back to you! When you make a comment I get a notification which allows me to see your concerns instantly. **When a private message is sent  it immediately goes into my 'Message Requests' which I never get a notification for and have to actively remember to check it everyday (which can be hard!). I've got over 40 message requests now  which has left me quite swamped and feeling helpless because I didn't see them sooner and don't know where to start/if I can. So I'd really recommend at least leaving a comment first in the thread before messaging me privately. I want to help!**

2. Leaving a comment means that other people can read your questions  and they can also read my answers! This allows people to find answers to their questions easier as they may have the same question in their minds that has been asked before  and they can find that its been asked & answered. This stops a flood of repeat questions  and allows public access of all the information and experiences I can provide. **It is absolutely imperative to me that all of the information  advice and questions here remain completely public  free of charge and can be revisitable.**

3. **I can understand some of what you may want to talk about is more private/personal  so in this case please leave a comment requesting to message me and allow me to give you permission to message me before you send a private message.** This allows me to remember to check my message requests  and confirms that I can give you the attention and shoulder to lean on that you may need. There are times I will be absent due to personal commitments and real life  so I want to be able to reassure you on when I have the time to get back to you.

Again  I just wanted to say thank you and that I am insanely grateful for and proud of everyone here. I hope you know this is written in good faith and not to shame anybody  **I just want to help all of you as much as I can so making it easier to navigate and accessible means that more people can get the help they need x**",550,549,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/10jcfko/longterm_anxiety_symptoms_i_had_from_someone_who/
Anxiety,Am I helping or hurting my girlfriend long-term by taking care of everything when she shuts down from her Anxiety?,"I am 29M and she is 30F
I'll clear two things up right away:

1) She is medicated and seeing a therapist for G.A.D.  She is self-aware of her anxiety  communicative  and present in the relationship.  She is *usually* present with helping to maintain the household.  She is incredibly loving and has never *ever* said an unkind or insensitive thing to me.

2) I do not *at all* mind handling the household when she is ""spacey"" as she calls it.  I love this woman to the moon and back  and gladly take care of her.  My priority is to make her feel safe  loved  and at peace.  In fact  I'm usually the one telling her that I'll handle everything. 

My question is this:  

Am I ""enabling"" her?  My protectiveness/nurturing side wants to lay her down and bring her snacks and a cat and a blanket.  But deep down my ""fixer/do-er brain"" thinks she needs to engage her mind elsewhere  go on a walk  do a puzzle  hit the gym  you name it.  Anything besides sinking into a cloud seems more healthy for her mind  but I never  *ever* pressure her.

This is worth adding.  As her man  I do not for one minute care about her body.  I love this woman's very soul  but her weight gain is stressing HER  out  deeply.  As her partner and teammate  I am wondering if I should be gently encouraging her to be more active.  Am I being neglectful by not?

I invite her on my daily walks  but I know saying no makes her feel guilty.  Same with when I invite her to the gym or just to go to the store.  I never make a face or express disappointment  because this woman feels guilt like it's her job.

I just want to help without being overbearing.  I also want her to feel like she can heal/grow however she needs to in our home without feeling pressure or judgement.  I just wanted to come here and ask for advice from people who live with it.",4,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1akwybs/am_i_helping_or_hurting_my_girlfriend_longterm_by/

Anxiety,It was my birthday yesterday and I spent most of the day crying and depressed but we can't give up.. or we lose the chance that things can get better..,25 was a hard birthday for me. Reflecting on my life and where I'm at had me feeling really down. It seemed out of no where my mental health started making things that were once easy  very very hard. It's taken a toll on my self esteem. I'm starting over with everything. Myself  my home  my career  my education  my health  my relationships  nothing is the same. I've been battling bipolar depression  panic attacks  schizophrenia episodes  constant suicidal ideation and started 2020 in a mental hospital begging to just die. I've lost my identity in the process of everything. I've never been more scared. I'm trying medication again  I'm back in therapy and am having more good days. I'm working on reaching out more to people.  I'm thankful for those who made my quarantine birthday special. My mom made me a home made birthday cake with all my favorite things  my boyfriend had a paint night with me  my sister ordered me dinner to enjoy at home and the birthday wishes from everyone did not go unnoticed. I'm thankful to still be here  still trying  and still fighting & I'm thankful for those that haven't given up on me when I've given up on myself.

Anxiety,Weird but Surprisingly Effective Ways to Reduce Anxiety,"Hey everyone 

I've been exploring unusual ways to deal with anxiety  and I thought I'd share a list of weird strategies that have worked for me. Like probably everyone else here I have tried a ton of different traditional methods to relieve anxiety such as breathing exercises  meditation  journaling  therapy  working out etc and while those are amazing methods that work for some  sometimes nothing seems to help in the moment. So I started experimenting and came up with some unconventional tricks (and some I’ve picked up from others) that work surprisingly well for me!

I have separated methods into different categories so you can browse each category depending on what works for you!

**Body Oriented:**

* **Turn Your Room Cold** \- Turn the heat down or open a window. A colder space can sometimes help your body calm down.
* **Chug a Bottle of Water** \- It’s refreshing and forces you to pause for a second. Bonus: dehydration can make anxiety worse  so this helps on two levels.
* **Lay on Your Other Side (Away From Your Heart)** \- If you’re lying on your left side and can feel your heartbeat too strongly  flip over. It can stop you from hyper-focusing on it.
* **Dunk Your Face in Ice Water/Take a Cold Shower** \- This one feels extreme but it really works. It triggers your ""dive reflex "" which slows your heart rate and calms your nervous system.
* **Hold Ice Cubes or Something Cold** \- The cold sensation brings you back into your body and out of your head.
* **Sit on the Floor** \- Just plop down wherever you are. Sitting on the ground can make you feel more grounded.

**Mind Tricking:**

* **Spell Words Backward** \- Pick a random word (like elephant for example) and spell it in reverse. Keep repeating with different words until you are distracting enough to break the cycle of anxious thoughts.
* **Count Things Around You** \- Look around the room and count how many blue objects you can see or how many things are round.
* **Force Yourself to Smile** \- Even fake smiling can trigger endorphin release and convince your brain you’re okay.
* **Do Some Math** \- Start at 100 and count backward by 7s. Or do a Times table.

**Behavorial:**

* **Flip Your Environment Around** \- Rearrange your furniture  your desk  or even just your pillows. Cleaning up your space can shift your mindset too.
* **Play The Floor Is Lava** \- Lol like the game you played as a kid. Jumping around the room is a great distraction.
* **Eat Some Crunchy or Sour Snacks** \- The texture  taste and sound give your mind something else to focus on.
* **Wrap Yourself With Blankets** \- Weighted blankets are ideal  but even regular ones can work.
* **Gratitude** \- Think about everything you are grateful for. This can help take your mind off of insecurities you are thinking about.

**Environmental:**

* **Turn on White Noise or Static** \- The background hum of white noise can calm your brain if silence feels too loud. However  this one sometimes leads to hyperfocusing on intrusive thoughts  dissociation or depersonalization for me  so proceed with caution.
* **Dim the Lights or Change the Color** \- Swap your lighting for something softer or cooler (like blue or green tones).
* **Smell Something Really Strong** \- Smell something like peppermint  citrus  or even vinegar because a strong scent can ""shock"" your senses and pull you out of your anxious headspace.

**Interactive:**

* **Carry Something Heavy** \- Holding something with weight can help ground you.
* **Balance on One Leg** \- It sounds weird  but focusing on balancing can help distract you.
* **Scribble** \- Grab a pen and just scribble as hard and fast as you can. Helps release energy  is super calming  and can help distract you
* **Stare at Something Moving** \- Watch a fan  a candle flame  bobblehead  the snow falling outside  etc. It gives your mind something repetitive and calming to focus on. However  this one also sometimes leads to hyperfocusing on intrusive thoughts  dissociation or depersonalization for me  so again  proceed with caution.

Some of these sound ridiculous  but they’ve actually helped me  and I hope they can help you too!!!",1644,107,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1hvxl8s/weird_but_surprisingly_effective_ways_to_reduce/
Anxiety,I give up. No one understands me,19 F. On thurs Feb 27 after I kissed someone my throat started feeling tight and it's uncomfortable to talk. I waited to see if it will go away but no  in fact I develop more symptoms on March 2. I developed  sharp pricking sensation in my chest  back tightness  painless red dots on the roof of my mouth heart palpitations and arm ache. I go to urgent care they gave me medication for oral yeast infection  they also test me for strep and covid and those are normal . The next day my symptoms still bothered me so I go to the hospital  and without any exams just basic bloodwork they tell me that i seem fine that it could be anxiety. My anxiety is undercontrol so I get so mad when they say it's anxiety. They discharge me  and I'm still overwhelmed  depressed  and sick. I waited some more with the discomfort of my symptoms  and went back to the ER yesterday but a different one in my city. At this ER I show them a list of my symptoms and the tests I want to be run in case their is an underlying issue  they reject it and only do the tests and imaging they want to do. They put me on a monitor and my heart rate is persistently beating fast like 120 bpm then it goes down and back up. The results came back normal. They told me i might have OCD apart from anxiety but how does ocd cause your heart beat to be elevated for almost 2 weeks and all the other symptoms. ,0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1j8flx3/i_give_up_no_one_understands_me/
Anxiety,Should I still try or just give up?,"Hi Im Max  18 and currently still in school.

I got a somewhat big problem. I got lots of school „friends“ or like people i am good with but noone that i go party with or can meet up with. Whats more im in a Chat with like 9 ppl in total and guess what? They all met up today  drank a bit and had fun (or at least their snaps looked like fun) but I didnt even get asked. And to be honest I already know they have like 2 or more other groups where they discuss this stuff without me.
But to get back to the main point. I finish school in like 4 months and after that I go to university and move away. So I was wondering if it would be worth a shot and confront one or two of them about it. Because I also dont wanna force myself onto them if most of them dont want me with them. And I guess I can survive another few months like this.

Anyone willing to share his opinion?

No matter how hard I try I keep failing and i don’t want to accept that this field is not for me. This is my dream. I really want to graduate but maybe it’s time to give up. I always take my university seriously and having to give up despite trying so hard is shattering my heart.

Anxiety,I cant beat up anxiety .I give up,I have the worst anxiety ever. Im in my last year of hight school and i cant sosialize and be calm even in 10seconds. Bc of anxiety i have failed so MANY EXAMS .My brain is constantly projecting myself in 3rd person and i realize that maybe im afraiz of how i look in people’s eyes. I have 2 friends in class rn and when they are absent i dont speak to anyone  just starring in my phone 6 hours. SO EXHAUSTING. Anxiety is so fuckn draining that when i got back home it takes me hours to return to my   normal” self. The irony is that i LOVE meeting new people and talking in general  im super positive person. The school is enviroment where i have been bullied by my classmates 3 years ago. Their behaivor was always judgmental.This was the lowest point of my life. I was sooo insecure and didnt realized my potential. Now im away from their friend cirle but still the wound wont heal. Maybe thats the reason that my anxiety is severe now. Im having trust issues. Its so dull i cant SHOW my potential be myself and CONFIDENT !!!I I hate it so much. Ive tried therapy meditation and other methods .They work but its temporary .Im so sick of everything. I cant talk to wherever i want and do normal things without looking around me whos watching. I want to have a normal life. If anyone has any advice im open.

Anxiety,Check up post! Feel free to share how you’re doing with your anxiety  whether is good or not so much. Feel free to affirm  give advice or do anything else that’s civilized  and not harmfu towards other! I’ll go first,"Well generally I have no idea 
Some days are good some are confusing 
Dealing with grief but not in a depressing way as it sounds 
Flipped off by my birthday yesterday 
Getting into an amazing relationship which I hope I won’t sabotage with anxiety related actions (or others)
Some days I feel ‘on it’ like I can function like a normal person with school and paper and social interaction 
Other times I feel like a disappointing wreck  so torn off from University and whatever’s going on in there. 
Able to wake up and actually start my day better than prior days. Though this boldly does not apply for today. 
Really wanting to focus on being more open emotionally this year  being more independent and communicating better - While remembering that I need to watch out for myself before I get too over whelmed. 
Hope it goes well  interpersonally and academically. Scared but excited - manifesting no fall into depression!
Trying to get all the help I can without leaning on other individuals too hard and have my mind as sorted out as possible. Also in a really weird limbo in my therapy which I most likely desperately need but can’t seem to get it right. But I am hopeful!

Anxiety,I had a panic attack while driving  pulled over off the road to stay safe  and someone hit me at full speed while texting and driving. My car was totaled.,"I've been diagnosed with GAD and have had a few pretty bad panic attacks in my life. Last night I was driving from my old apartment to my first house I just bought with the last load of my house plants (I had about 35 in the car  it's a hobby of mine).

For some reason I'm still unsure of  I started having a panic attack. My heart rate went up  the pit of my stomach dropped  I felt woozy  broke out in cold sweat  and felt extremely anxious. Right before going onto the highway  I pulled to the side off the road with my hazards on to give myself time to come down off of this panic attack. I called my partner  who was at the house  and told him I was having a panic attack and he  worked with me to help me get grounded and calm. 

I ended the call after about 8 minutes and told him I would call him back when I felt good to drive again. The intensity of the attack was coming in waves at this point  but it was gradually lessening. Less than 2 minutes after the call ended  someone rammed full speed into the back of my car. My car was lurched forward with an awful crunch  plant dirt and debris flew every where  I was thrown forward but my seat belt caught me. I was OFF the road to the side with my hazards on  this guy had to have somehow swerved and not seen my car to have hit me. 

I had no immediate injuries  but I was terrified. I've never heard myself scream like that. The panic attack I had almost gotten under control was now replaced with absolute mayhem of fear and pure adrenaline. The guy came out of his car and approached mine  I was already on the phone with police. He kept trying to give me his license and saying he was going to give me his insurance info. I was sobbing and telling him to wait I'm on the phone with the police. He handed me his license  so I took a picture of it while trying to describe to the location to the 911 operator. He took his license and drove off without getting his insurance. He spoke not great English and I think he was terrified and didn't know what to do. 

The police came with an ambulance. They took my vitals. I had no pain in my neck  back  stomach  or any where. I told the police what happened and showed them the pic of this guy's license. They were like ""WTF this guy gave you his license but not his insurance and drove off?"" That is a hit and run felony. I think the guy was trying to do the right thing but got scared and fled. The police caught him in about 30 mins. Turns out a car with a lot of front damage can't get very far.

My car was totaled  the back wheel was completely torn off and the back axel was twisted beyond repair. Many of my house plant's pots had shattered immediately. I had to leave half of them in the car as it got taken to an impound lot because there wasn't enough room in my friend's car who came and picked me up. I loved this car so much  it saved my fucking life. I was beside myself seeing it being towed away  broken beyond repair  with some of my beautiful house plants still in it. 

I am fully covered for by insurance so they will be paying me out for the value of my car. I will be able to go to the impound lot to get the remainder of my plants and belongings. 

What just strikes me as so fucking cruel was that I had a panic attack and chose to safely move off the road to not put myself or other drivers in danger  and I still got hit and my car was totaled. 

I'm so grateful to still be alive and not in tjr hospital. But I'm scared about what this means for me and my anxiety moving forward. Will I have PTSD from this? Will I be scared of driving/cars moving forward?",1774,111,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n1smxe/i_had_a_panic_attack_while_driving_pulled_over/
Anxiety,I'm don't know how to overcome a fear of things important to me getting broken,"I'm not quite sure if this specific fear has a name  I only learned about it a few weeks ago when my counselor helped me realize it even existed. But to explain  throughout my life  things that are really important to me that I always do my best to take care of  have gotten broken or messed up time and time again by outside circumstances.

This fear has gone into overdrive as my parents got me a very nice new microphone for Christmas and... I've been too scared to take it out of the box. When I talked with my counselor about it  she advised at the very least to just take it out of the box to start  not really getting it set up yet  just taking it out of the box. I was okay with it and was feeling pretty alright  until the very next day after I did so my mom had had someone come to clean the carpets and I was out of the house so I had no clue that my office would be being cleaned as well  so they stacked anything on the floor or too close to the floor on top of my desk and that led to my Dumbo snow globe I've had since I was a kid being broken.

It was an immediate gut reaction afterwards to put the microphone back in the box  which I did  but my current one is really starting to get out of whack(funny enough this may also be caused by the fact my dad was in a bad mood when we got home from a vacation and instead of letting me grab my stuff chucked said microphone onto the pavement a couple of years ago) so I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else deals with a fear like this and might have any advice on how to overcome it?

TL;DR I'm terrified of my nice new microphone getting broken and need some advice on how to overcome that anxiety and start using it",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11kk68v/im_dont_know_how_to_overcome_a_fear_of_things/
Anxiety,TW: God  hell has broken loose again and I might be murdered and Im horrified and I dont want to die,"Hi  I am from Israel. I have bad OCD. 

There have been so goddamn many rockets and terror attacks in the last few days  including rockets that killed  a few civillians and a whole bunch of fighting  riots  anger and hate. Fires been lit up and specifically civillian aread are targets now for rockets. Even jerusalem was bombed and went up in flames in several hot spots.

I am so fucking terrified of being lynched and murdered. I dont want to leave my house but I have a final soon and Ill have to eventually. I go to a religious school so I wear religious identifying clothes and so I could be a target. Last time shit got this bad buses were exploding  month long terror waves of daily murder were going on  where even my brothers friend was murdered brutally in the street and just by chance a massive mass shotting was halted that would have been the end of hundreds of lives. I dont wanna die i dont wanna die i dont wanna die because of some shit politics.

And my fucking school people say that by continueing to function normally they rebel so they honor being killed this way as a fucking sacrifice. I dont want to sacrifice myself because my goverment is shitty.

Fucking help  Im going crazy  i dont want to be killed. And the worst part is sometimes the terror attacks are carried out in school shootings and my school also doesnt have proper bomb shelters. 


Help  please. I dont know what to do. I dont want to be here. Theres nothing I can do. 

My room is a bomb shelter and I havent left it in a couple days. Im too scared of leaving. My OCD was always danger related and I have locking compulsions  and finally I started working toward fixing it and now this shit happens. Ive relapsed and locked my house on 3 locks one metal extra door and in my bomb shelter room and I want to leave but I am terrified.

Anxiety,Started a new job yesterday and had a complete breakdown when I got home. I need the money  I have to leave in an hour  and I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm broken and a complete waste.,Applied for the post office a few months back for holiday work. Pay is very well and I didn't work at all this year cause of Covid. For the rest of the month and all of December  we are forced to work 12 hour shifts 6 days a week with an occasional 7 day week. I was fine for half of the day and enjoyed it a bit. Out of nowhere  everything just plummeted. I can't explain why. There was no more happiness  no joy  and I felt numb. My mind was nothing but horrible thoughts. I couldn't think. I can't take it. At the end of the day I'm mentioned to my trainer/supervisor who talked with me for a bit. She said I did very well and I dunno. I drove home in silence crying and just ranted to my dad. Nothing works. I can't find anything. I've struggled with this for years and nothing works. I fear I will never find a job and earn money. I feel like a completely hopeless waste of a life. I have less than an hour to leave and I don't know if I can. I need the money so bad and I can't think of anything. I never hold down a job and know I'm an utter failure.,6,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/k1kzm7/started_a_new_job_yesterday_and_had_a_complete/

 My mother  sisters  grandmother   and step-father are supportive of me but  when I try to talk  to them about my problem I panicked about how they gonna react  and play it down  so they think its not that bad. 

Sometime my anxiety transform into anger  and I'm so afraid  at what i can do when i am like this. 

I did see a psychologist whan i was young.  I thoguht she was  nice at frist  but then she told my mother that i was just  weak minded and jsut making this up for attention.  I was Fucking 8  or 9 at th time.  I never felt more betrayed  in my life  and since then  I developped  a fear of    psychologist and never  speak to one after that. 

   my post will probably be ignored  and mocked because of my bad english  but I jsut wanted to say it  once because I think Ive given up  on having a normal life.

Anxiety,No matter how much progress i make i still feel like I'm broken.,"I've had very bad social anxiety since i was a kid  and it's been with me into college now.

I really wanted to be better  so i tried my hardest this semester to fix myself.

At the start of the semester  the thought of meeting my roommate made me nauseous for weeks before we met. I forced myself to sit in the lounge and just do work near other people. It felt like i was at the top of a rollercoaster  for hours at a time. But i still did it  because i really wanted to be better. I worked really  really hard to get better  all semester.

Fast forward to a few nights ago  i pretended to rush a frat to get into a Party  got shitfaced  got grinded on  made conversation  got a whole group of people to laugh  got a girl's snap  I genuinely enjoyed myself and had fun.

But then i got back and i still feel the same. My anxiety is still there  it still hurts all the time. I spend most of the day convincing my anxiety that everyone doesn't secretly hate me  and it still makes me do dumb shit.

I had a question during a quiz  but was too scared to get up and ask. It's not like the anxiety fear  it's like my brain just won't let me do things. It's like anxiety but I'm numb to the fear  even though i still feel it.

I'm just sick of feeling like this all the time. No matter how hard i try it just doesn't go away. Everything is still really hard  it's just that i force myself to do shit More than i used to. I want to be normal so badly but it feels impossible to get there. I just want to know what it feels like to do things because you want to  not because you force yourself to do it.",3,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/az041a/no_matter_how_much_progress_i_make_i_still_feel/

Anxiety,I need help,"I don’t usually post here  but I wanted to be honest and ask for opinions on something I’m struggling with. I’ve been having persistent violent thoughts  sometimes imagining harming others and becoming fixated on disturbing content. I often feel numb  like I’m just angry all the time  and I find myself not being able to be around people  especially my dad. The thoughts I have about him and others have been increasingly troubling  and I feel disconnected from reality  sometimes paranoid  and unable to escape my mind.

My relationship with my family has always been difficult  and there’s a lot of unresolved trauma. I’ve had lucid dreams and intrusive thoughts that make me feel like I’m being watched or that something is wrong  and I don’t know how to deal with it. I’ve hurt animals in the past  and I’m struggling to cope with a growing sense of anger and frustration.

I know these feelings and thoughts aren’t normal  but I feel disconnected from others and unsure of what to do. I don’t really feel empathy  and I struggle to understand people’s intentions. Sometimes  I wonder what’s wrong with me  but I don’t feel like anyone can help. I’m just trying to figure out what’s going on in my mind and if it’s something that I can change or if I’m stuck this way.

Anxiety,I need help  please,"Hello to you all  I am writing here out of desperation  fear and anxiety. I am extremely scared throughout the whole day  every action of mine leading to worry. I am scared or rather even convinced I have dementia or something else that is leading to my decline in my ability to think. Or that maybe my liver is unable to expunge toxins due to it being fatty and that is destroying my brain. I feel like I've lost my appetite  I don't even want to do anything  and can't bring myself to  I feel like just laying down doing nothing  maybe falling asleep and never waking up again. 
It started at the begining of this month  that is January  as if from day to day I felt weird brain fog in the morning  then I couldn't fall asleep at all and even if I did it was neither restful nor long  my heart was beating so fast too. I also feel like I've gotten worse since the start of it all. 
That I will lose my ability to think  to speak  that I will be unable to care for myself and be independent  that I will burden my family with it. I really feel as if I don't have much time left and I can't even imagine slowly losing my ability to function and think  I don't want to imagine it! 
And if it really is dementia or something like that  there is no cure  no way to stop it  there is nothing I could do  and neither could I request euthanasia since it's illegal in Poland.
I really do hope  even pray despite not believing that it's just my imagination  or maybe even some other affliction  anything that at least can be cured.
I am also subjecting my parents to worry and causing them distress from it all  but I still just want to spend as much time as I have left with them. I regret not doing so earlier  I regret not listening to them more often especially regarding to health  thinking I knew better. I will be going to schedule an appointment with a neurologist  but I will most likely still have to wait around a month  and I don't think I will make it if things stay as they are. I went to psychologist yesterday for my first visit but I don't know if it will help  especially since she also said I should check with either neurologist os psychiatrist  even if it is to rest easy. I've become a wreck  something within me broke and I'm scared I won't be able to fix it  since there may be no way for me to do so. I've been having trouble concentrating  loosing my thoughts  having to re-read sentences in books etc since I forget what I was reading  same with watching videos etc  I feel as if I'm getting dumber  I also have to think what I'm about to say and I'm losing worlds  I've been having headaches too  weird ones. My family doctor said that it is just stress and that it's only in my head  could it really be it?
If it is why has it been going on for a month already?! Why do I feel as if it's getting worse too. It's interfering with my life  I have to focus on normal every day things  I'm scared to sleep  that I won't be able too  I'm scared of being alone  scared of driving that maybe I will cause an accident becaus something in my mind suddenly stops working. I can't even distract myself with anything because every action and little mistake leads me further down the spiral.
Am I going insane? Am I losing my mind? Am I going to die soon in a slow and agonizing way  feeling that I'm slipping away losing myself?! Or could it really just be stress  anxiety and panic. Why can't I just return to my normal life?! Will I really die at just 22? What should I even do  I don't want to annoy my parents anymore and cause them distress but I just need and want to be close with them.

Anxiety,I’m really struggling with my anxiety  have barely been able to stomach the food past week and have cried myself to sleep every night.,I have a lot of big life decisions coming up in the next month or two and I’m just feeling extremely overwhelmed with it all. A potential vertical move opened at work  which usually is a great thing  but I’m not sure I’m fit for the role and am scared of how it’ll effect my relationship with the hiring manager (who I work with often) if I don’t get the job. I don’t want it to be weird or awkward. At the same time  I received an interview request from my dream company. At almost any other point in my life I would be very excited  but right now I just moved to a new place about a year ago and feel like I haven’t really given it a fair shot. I’d have to move back home if I were to get offered and accept the role which isn’t a bad thing since my mom also has been really struggling with me being so far away and this has really weighed on my conscious too but I know I’d regret leaving here when I’ve only been here about a year. But if I were to get offered and turn it down  I don’t know if there would ever be an opportunity to work for my dream company again. On top of juggling interviews for the two  I also don’t want my boss to find out I’m speaking with another company  as if I don’t get the offer I don’t want it to effect my reputation here. So I’m juggling two sets of interviews   trying to keep one hidden from the other  and on top of all of this my lease ends at the start of April so I need to find out if I’m going to continue living here or if I will be moving  and my roommate needs to know ASAP so he can arrange.

Anxiety,Im tired of this  i want my life back. This just keeps happening. Every night i worry  is it going to happen and it does. my landlord said i call 911 1 more time i got to get out.. Im crying as i type all this.,"I need a sponsor or someone to talk to other than my doctor. Shes ok but just tosses meds at me.

  
i know this is years old but this happens to me alot and its about to mess with my place i live  she warned me today. and i have it good here. I have called 911 3 times since being here. I keep waking up feeling really dizzy and warm all over  heart racing even tho im on metropolo 25mg.. by the time they get there my BP is only elevated not crazy. 12 lead EKG is always normal. Then i go lay back down and sleep just fine then wake up shaky af  well today is probably bc i kept making myself go back to sleep for 16 hours. So I'm just now eating or drinking anything that might be the shakiness.

  
So yeah key things  Im eating before i lay down to go to sleep. I do have really bad panic attack and anxiety issues but I also have high blood pressure and i know all 3 of those together are not good. I am on prozac 20mg on week two  i see no difference really. 

  
I was in the hospital two weeks ago for 4 days because prior to going i had called 911 24 times and went the hospital 2 times  so this 3rd time I went to a different one and they asked how long my rapid heart rate episodes ect had been happening  told them that 4 months or so  i woke up out of my sleep wide awake heart racing trying to catch my breath and ive been scared to death ever since.. 

  
So they admitted me  told me in the morning your having a stress test done on your heart and we are going to monitor it while your here.. Ok did the stress test  keep in mind im 350 pounds too. I quit smoking 7 weeks ago  no caffeine in 2 weeks. I changed my diet to healthy food only over the past few weeks. No fast food  very little salt you get the idea. So I did make alot of big changes really fast out of fear  which isnt a bad thing but yeah I should be filling better not more scared.

  
I just want to get back to being normal  not being afraid of dying  afraid of passing out ect.. I have my good moments  i know my triggers and its like i trigger myself.

  
Anyone have any advice who has been in my shoes on gettting better? Also im due to have my gallbladder taken out in the next month or so. then a major hernia repair and suffer from constipation from suboxone. I put my faith in god and im doing the right things. I just want to wake up and be my old self  not worried about so much negative and just be normal again and live life.. ill be 40 in two months..

Anxiety,How I Overcame DPDR (symptoms  feedback loop  anxiety  my story  tips & advice),"Hi everyone  I really wanted to do/felt like I should make a separate master-post for how I overcame DPDR (depersonalization and derealization) that was triggered by long-term anxiety  as well as some of the symptoms  mechanisms of DPDR  feedback loop  triggers & more.

I made a previous master-post on my long-term anxiety symptoms (which I overcame) where I went over the more bizarre  rarely spoken about  constant symptoms of long-term anxiety  and the feedback loop and it seemed to help a lot of people. I will link that one below  I recommend everyone read it first!

Warning  this is a big post.

Lets go over some positives first as I find its always best to get off on a positive note  and to have something to look forward to or motivate others:

**1. DP/DR (Depersonalization and Derealization) is not and is never permenant  anyone who says so are catastrophizing and are probably biased or feeling that way due to their own condition not improving. These notions are not helpful and are also not true.**

**It will and can go away 100%  it is not something you have to 'deal' with or 'accept' for the rest of your life.**


**2. DP/DR does not work like a debt system e.g. the longer you are in DP/DR  the longer it is going to take you to get out of it (isn't true!). Everyone has the same chance of success in recovering from DP/DR  no matter how long or short you have been in that state.**
**3. DP/DR is not indicative or a sign of psychosis  and you will not become psychotic if you experience DP/DR.**


DP/DR is a **defense mechanism**  which attempts to make sure that only the body experiences pain or trauma and not the mind  by causing detachment. **Causes of DP/DR can be anxiety attacks  severe stress  health anxiety  drug induced (often from edibles or hallucinogens)  traumatic first-hand or second-hand situations  abuse or any interpersonal trauma. Anyone of any age can experience DP/DR.**

.......................................................................

**What does DP/DR feel like?:**

- Everything feels (and looks) either too close or too far away from you  environments are distorted
- Everything feels flat or 2D  like it isn't quite real or tangible  others faces might feel unreal
- Can feel like the world is slipping away from you
- You might feel like you could fall over any second or fall through the floor
- Speech can feel slow/slurred  like your brain is struggling to find words
- Time can feel like its going too fast or too slow
- Feeling like you can observe yourself outside your body  everything feels disconnected  like you are very alone
- Your limbs can feel too small  too big  like you are taller or shorter than you actually are
- You might feel internally dizzy (like your mind is spinning but your vision isn't)  woozy head feelings  fuzzy head
- More frequent feelings of nostalgia/dejavu
- Colours can feel more dull or distorted
- Feeling numb  like your memories are less tangible or unreal
- Hypochondria (Healthy Anxiety) is often a huge comorbidity with DP/DR

.......................................................................

**The Feedback Loop  what is it?**

Symptoms of DP/DR (as well as Anxiety/Health Anxiety) are often kept alive by or started something called the **Feedback Loop.** This is a loop that is constantly being fed into  which could have started from something as for example:

*You may be minding your own business one day and suddenly experience a Panic Attack  but you misread it as being something worse. You could think you're about to die  that you are having a heart attack because of the palpitations  that you could collapse any moment now  and then it goes... but you're on edge  what if it happens again? Do I have a heart condition? I think I'm dying  I think something is wrong. Everyday you are waking up and checking if you can feel palpitations  you're scared it will happen again  you're getting waves of dread  your mind is full of 'what ifs' over and over again every single day. Then one day  nothing feels real and you feel completely detached from reality and this scares you even more  you feel like you're slipping away  you're terrified and feel like you'll never be normal again. You're waking up everyday to check if everything still feels unreal  and it does  its not going away. Whats happening?*


This is the **Feedback Loop** example which led to DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms. What should've happened when you experienced for example: a Panic Attack  was that **you should've been able to realise it was a Panic Attack and been able to ground yourself or calm down during that situation and it would go away. This would eliminate the start of the Feedback Loop**  but instead by misreading the situation or not having the appropriate tools to manage it  you are now in fear  in high stress and feeling traumatised of the situation in fear it will happen again or that something worse is happening to you. This keeps the Loop alive and going.

**In preparation for the pain or fear you are about to anticipate happening  your body chose to disassociate from your mind and cause DP/DR in order to handle the stress and fear of what you're afraid of experiencing. DP/DR is attempting to save you from what could happen to you next  after being activated from something that already hurt you or traumatised you.**

Identifying the first source of your DP/DR can be particularly important in understanding and learning where your Feedback Loop started. **For some people it can even extend to as far as childhood  which can sometimes result in something known as DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)**. Once you have identified the source  this is the stepping stone into recovering from DP/DR.

Sources of DPDR can be: drug-induced from hallucinogens/edibles/bad trips/alcohol or other substances  anxiety attacks  depression  stress  medical trauma/childhood trauma/adulthood trauma/being a child of divorce  sexual assaults/CSA  PTSD  DID and more

Environments are also very important to be recognised as sources of DPDR e.g. stressful jobs  stressful/abusive relationships  difficult home life  being a full-time carer for family  difficult school life etc

.......................................................................

**So what's going to help me get better?**

There's a lot of resources and therapies available for DP/DR  such as Psychotherapy (talking therapies)  CBT  DBT  EMDR and more.

But what is most important is that you are able to help yourself  as well as having professional support should you require it. **The thing that is going to get you better the most is you  and the tools you can develop to help you in time of need and in how you navigate the world and your trauma**. Some people (like me) may be able to recover from DP/DR without professional intervention or therapies  but it is always incredibly recommended if you have access or can afford it. **With DP/DR being highly trauma related  it is important to have a safe place to unload and traverse trauma with a professional**  as it can be tough to handle alone. **If you are concerned or suspect your DP/DR may be a result of DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)  professional help is absolutely necessary.**

Every person with DP/DR will be completely unique in their needs  what they can handle alone or what they need support with.

.......................................................................

**What can we do for ourselves?**

This is going to go over some self-practices and tools you can do in your own time to help yourself while actively experiencing DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms  and also how to reduce the chances of re-experiencing it when you are recovered.

**Staying Busy & Challenging Yourself:**

A big part of dissolving the Feedback Loop is by no longer feeding into it  and one way of doing this is by diverting our thoughts from the feelings of DP/DR or anxiety symptoms. **You want to find or make opportunities where you don't have time to think about DP/DR  or how it makes you feel  'scanning' for feelings or signs of it  and to challenge those feelings instead.**
**DP/DR and anxiety is the perfect time to get busy and involved with life**  whether it is your hobbies  being with your friends and family  doing chores that need to be done  starting things you've always wanted to do. **It can feel scary  even terrifying to partake in these things when you feel unreal  like you're not present or that the world is slipping away  but you must keep pushing through**. Once you begin to challenge yourself and challenge those feelings of 'not feeling real' you begin to establish trust within yourself.

**Don't be disheartened that DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms do not disappear right away overnight  this is because your body hormonally  needs time to acclimate to low levels of stress and anxiety after having been kept at such high levels. If these hormones were to plummet immediately  the body wouldn't be able to cope  so it likes to decline it gently! So consider it like you are establishing trust:**

DP/DR has been in the drivers seat all this time  and you've been the passenger in the back. You're finally insisting on being in the driver's seat  but DP/DR insists on being the passenger right next to you. DP/DR is going to freak out in the passenger seat and take the wheel from you at times during some tough situations because its not sure you can navigate it on your own  and instead of letting it take the driver's seat again you need to say to it  'Don't worry. I've got this'. and DP/DR will let go of the wheel. This in real life  would be an example of you handling the situation you are in and challenging yourself to face what makes you afraid (such as going outside in case you feel 'unreal').

**By doing this  you are establishing trust and are giving DP/DR the opportunity to know that you can handle the situation on your own. Eventually with time of practicing these things  DP/DR will get out of the car entirely and you can 'drive' all by yourself again and those feelings of DP/DR will be gone. You'll be able to live your life without things like anxiety or DP/DR dictacting where it takes you or how it makes you feel. You will have formed that trust that you can handle experiencing your pain  your fear  your trauma  your anxiety/stress etc. without the need of the defence mechanism of DP/DR. You will become the first line of defence!**

From personal experience this is what accelerated me to my complete recovery from DP/DR and long-term anxiety symptoms within 3-4 months of this practice after struggling for almost a year of non-stop DP/DR and anxiety symptoms. **I learned to empathise with my DP/DR's attempt at trying to keep me safe and acknowledged that it was only doing this in order to make me feel better  albeit in a scary and inconvenient way! So by learning techniques and also teaching myself not to be scared of DP/DR symptoms or my anxiety symptoms  I gave myself the opportunity to be the one in control and say ''Hey  I am totally capable of caring for myself now. Thank you for your help and what you tried to do for me'' to my DP/DR.**

By feeling afraid to participate in activities or doing things because you might feel unreal  or because the world feels distorted  you are allowing DP/DR to maintain control and are keeping DP/DR as an option

**Challenge yourself in incriments or in steps  and remember to reward yourself afterwards. Figure out what about DP/DR makes you afraid:**

**is it seeing people's faces? particularly friends or family?** - challenge yourself towards looking at faces  engaging with familiar faces (YouTubers  family  partners)  if you can touch their face then touch it  grounding exercises where you say ''I can see two eyes  they are [insert colour]  they have a [description] nose  do they have freckles? birth marks? do they have any smile lines? identify parts of their face and describe them'' this helps make them more tangible and less scary. Do little challenges before the bigger ones.

**is it going outside in case you feel unreal? woozy?** - challenge yourself towards small  short walks up and down your street  to eventually longer walks  acknowledge that you might be feeling dizzy/unreal but that you are safe  be kind & go home if you need it  try again another day  stay engaged with your hobbies/the outside world

**is it the feeling that you'll never be the same again? that you think its permenant? that you've ruined your life?** - The first thing you'll see if you look up 'can dpdr be permenant' is 'no!' and every other article will say no. There has never been an observed case of DPDR being permenant  and you won't be the first case of that happening. Its really important you do not entertain or engage with people who believe it is permenant  or that theirs is permenant because they are just people who are keeping their own DPDR alive with the negativity. I recommend writing positive affirmations or reading them  and engaging with positive stories of DPDR recovery and sticking with facts. **You have not ruined your life  and you will recover.**
**DPDR can make you feel afraid of lots of things  not just the ones I described above (but those are the most common).**

**Grounding Exercises:**
Grounding is a way to refocus and bring your attention back to the present and the world around you. This is can be used when experiencing fear or anxiety of your current DP/DR state  but is **most effective when you feel like it is 'coming on' or you are experiencing anxiety/stress that could lead to it.**

Grounding exercises can involve:

- Naming 5 things you can see  name 4 things you can touch and to touch them  naming 3 things you can hear and listening to them  what 2 things can you smell  1 thing you can taste.
- Holding ice cubes  putting your hands in cold water  picking up or touching things and explaining how it feels (is it cold  warm  does it feel rough or soft)  identifying their colours deeply
- Walks without music  tuning into the sounds of your steps  counting your steps  observing your surroundings on your walks  sitting in the grass and touching it.
- Mental anchoring by saying (in your head or quietly to yourself) your full name  your age  where you live  what street you live on  the date  where you are  what you're doing. Repeat this gently until you feel calm.
- Self-assurance phrases such as  ''You are okay''  ''Nothing can hurt me''  ''You will get through this''  ''I've done this once and I can do it again'' etc.

**My Example of How I Personally Recovered from DPDR:**

For me I dealt with a lot of wooziness/dizziness during my DP/DR and I felt terrified to do anything sitting up or standing because I'd have to acknowledge that dizzy feeling and the unreal-ness from DP/DR  so I would lie on my side all day while watching TV or playing games instead to cope. **I wanted to turn 'Oh god  no I'm dizzy and woozy and nothing feels real  I'm so scared' into 'Oh I'm dizzy and feel unreal today? Lets see what I can manage'.**

It started to become more of 'Let's get up! Lets engage with the same hobbies but lets sit up this time'. I'd do that for as long as I feel I could handle the dizzines and unreal sensations  and then I'd lie back down again. I rewarded myself and cared for myself with a technique that brought me comfort  while having succeeded in engaging with something that scared me or was difficult. Over time I'd start to sit up for longer  or I'd start to go outside on short walks (which was particularly hard as I'd feel more unreal outside than at home)  and I would feel unreal  like everything was flat  like the world was slipping away but I did it.

Some days I would just cry or feel like I took steps back  that I'd be stuck forever but I kept going and I kept rewarding myself after those times with either little lie downs  eating things I really loved  engaging in self-care or watching familiar TV shows I know I loved. Over time I started to sit up a lot more  I started to stand more  I started to go out more and for much  much longer each time  I started to do all the things I loved again despite how I felt. **Don't get me wrong  I still felt unreal and dizzy but I wanted to stop being scared of it and to not let it stop me engaging with things I loved or wanted to do.**

**I stopped basing my days and thoughts on 'how good I'm feeling' and more so on 'how well can I manage today'.** That took away a lot of pressure for me  as I knew I would not feel better over night but I would learn to manage my days better  so focusing on that intrinsically helped me feel better. You'll want to learn how to manage bad days (whether DPDR days  anxious days  stressful days) because when you do  you'll become prepared for if you ever face any of those times again and you can conquer it!

One day after months of challenging myself  being more present  doing my hobbies  going outside (I remember this vividly) I was hugging my partner and I looked up at his face and I physically jumped  **he looked real. I started looking around everywhere and everything felt real  everything looked so colorful  the world didn't feel flat or distorted  everything felt 'real' and 'right' and when I touched my partner's face it felt so tangible and real.** I don't think I've ever cried that hard in my life from happiness  my DPDR was gone.

Everything probably felt like this for a while  but because I was so engrossed in engaging with the world around me and doing the things I loved I didn't actually realise it  because I was no longer questioning my reality or looking for signs of DP/DR. **So that one moment where I finally remembered to 'check' my reality  it made me realise everything felt real again and that I felt human again. And it never came back.**

When you feel ready  the key is to be kind to yourself as well as challenge yourself against your DPDR and how it makes you feel. By pushing through and engaging with the world around you bit by bit you will start to establish that trust  those tools  in convincing your body that you can handle yourself and that it no longer needs to detach with DPDR to keep you safe.

.......................................................................

**Some habits to get into  and some to get rid of:**

- **Cut out all alcohol and all drugs absolutely and completely  as well as caffeine & reduce or quit smoking.** All of these substances will have an effect on the hormones in your body  and can impede progress from DP/DR due to the sensations it can produce and will generally stress out the body  and mind-altering drugs like hallucinogens or Cannabis can worsen DP/DR greatly or keep it around. *If you are an addict or suffer from addictions  get in touch with services that can help you taper  detox or navigate potential sobriety  do not attempt any of this alone.*

- **Establish a normal bedtime routine**  ideally getting into bed at 9-10pm and waking up before 9am. Some people need more sleep than others so wake up at whatever time in the morning before 9am is best for you; getting adequate sleep will greatly improve the rate of which your DP/DR can dissolve as your mind will be most lucid  alert and prepared to handle potential stressors. **Sleeping too much or too little can greatly affect your brain and hormone regulation  and you need the best hormone regulation in order for the body to lower cortisol levels which leads to DP/DR symptoms rapidly improving.**

- **Stay hydrated and well-fed.** This is really typical mental health advice  but in general you will want to make sure you are hydrated and well-fed so the body has enough energy supply to handle stressors  anxiety and to ensure the mind is as lucid and energised as possible. You will need all the energy you can possibly get  and having these bases covered can really improve your symptoms.

- **Get checked for any Vitamin Deficiencies** as a lot of Vitamins we can be deficient in will greatly effect circadian rhythms  heart rhythms  the brain (deficiencies can cause brain fog  low motor skill function and poor hormone regulation). **Making sure we have healthy  functioning foundations to work off of greatly supports mental function and our ability to take on new information and learn new things (such as therapeutic tools and treatment).**

- **Identify your stressors and reduce them  identify your triggers and navigate them.** Cortisol levels increase with stress (from stressors) and anxiety  when we are faced with high levels of cortisol for extended periods of time  the body can produce bizzare and scary symptoms (which are harmless).

Anxiety,Cry every night,I just want to vent. I fucked up. I chose a wrong path (career wise) and I feel like I don't have any future (farway from what I hoped). I have no one to talk to so I cry every night due to anxiety over my future. I can't afford therapy because it's so damn expensive. I don't know what to do anymore.,9,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/179ax0v/cry_every_night/
Anxiety,I’m crying every night,"So I been having anxiety for months now it stemmed from me believing I was going to have a heart attack (medical anxiety).  2 weeks ago I was completely reassured that I'm healthy I do not think about my health or heart at all anymore. During this I made physical and diet changes. While I was having my anxiety moments  I wouldn't sleep well because I thought I would have a heart attack in my sleep so I would stay up really late and sleep in which I'm sure messed up my circadian rhythm too. 

But now my biggest problem is gone and yet I'm still suffering from anxiety  and it transformed into sleep anxiety. I get so nervous at night time because I'm afraid I won't be able to fall asleep and then I don't fall asleep. 
Two days ago I tried to be strict and go to sleep at the same time and wake up at the same time. I was not successful in sleeping. I would have an anxiety attack get up read or brain dump and then go back to bed   rinse and repeat until I did. I wake up at 9am exhausted but would push through the day do all my chores and work. But today I couldn't I was too exhausted after 2 days of no sleep essentially and I again struggled with sleep time went to sleep late at 7 AM and then ended up waking up at 5 PM missing my whole day which is what makes me get frustrated about this. I think I have insomnia. I want to figure out how to fix this on my own without pills. Is it possible that having anxiety all these months has affected me that now that the trigger is no longer there it's taking a while to go away or do I now have sleep anxiety and need to figure out what to do  I would say my trigger is that I'll sleep in and miss my day  and be up alone by myself all night. I was really hoping after my heart anxiety went away it would all go back to normal and it’s still bad I cry every night I just want to sleep at a good time and wake up and do my chores/job without being exhausted. I am looking for advice and/or herbal remedies.",4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/15m6pdd/im_crying_every_night/

Anxiety,Cry most nights before work,"Hi :)
I tend to cry most nights before work. 
I'm 19 and work retail part time only two days a week at the moment and it's really not that bad.
My coworkers are nice and the work isn't hard.

But still I find myself feeling this crushing dread every night before I have work the next day. I usually end up crying as I try to fall asleep and end up getting less sleep than I should.

I think that on days I don't have work  I stay up late until I'm so tired I don't have the energy to ruminate and I just pass out.
But when I have work  I just can't get to sleep on time and I have this irrational existential dread and sense of impending doom. Like I'm suddenly scared to be alone with my thoughts.

I think my mind automatically tries to attribute it to many things like my insecurity and feelings of inadequacy and lack of motivation. But it's also this deeper sense of terror and the need to distract myself with my phone or talking to family or anything. I'm not diagnosed with anxiety. 

I know that it's a common thing many other people experience too  just wanted to sort of vent.

I just feel like no one can understand what it's like to just not be even able to think straight and to just be constantly in that minset where nothing you hear or say  and I'm just on autopilot because my brain is just noticing and expecting when times and shit is gonna explode and my dad is gonna start yelling and breaking shit  worried about my mom and my siblings and just being there worried as fuck. 

But explaining that to people really never helps even closer people who are supposed to be understanding  but it's never enough it's just simply never will be enough for anyone to understand that i can not control it  that i simply can not control that moment.

Anxiety,I hate my life because of my Dad,I’m 15m my dad is a verbally abusive extremely mentally ill drug addict. I know he is bipolar and so much other stuff but every day he has a different mood one day he’s screaming punching holes in the wall threatening to kill himself then the next day he’s the nicest person I’ve ever met and just wants to play video games and watch movies and go golfing. My mom on the other hand is my everything I’m an only child and she has had osteoarthritis for 10+ years now and yet is the only person in the house who makes actual money yes my dad has a pretty stable job at the moment but it’s like 400$ every two weeks. Not to mention since my dad has brung me and my mom to a constant fear and depression the house has been a complete mess for years there is a bad roach infestation and my mothers clothes piled everywhere (she uses shopping to cope with her issuses) and I am a neat freak yet I feel so powerless over every situation in my life. Not to mention I haven’t did school since 6th grade since I was nearly molested at my old school so my parents took me out and I was gonna be homeschooled but my mom is constantly working or depressed or in agonizing pain and my dad is a dumbass so I haven’t did school. I have no meaning to life basically and practically no friends really just one I actually talk to. But even though she has her issues my mom is 100% the only reason I’m alive she has pulled me out of my darkest times. If you’re wondering… I’m not sure why we haven’t left my dad I think because the good times we have with him are amazing and we have no where to go anyway and my mom has quite an issue with doing anything other than work. I don’t know what to do or where to go I have crippling anxiety to where I can’t leave the house but I hate it here anyway so that’s all annoying and I can’t do anything with my life really without anxiety because of my dad. Also I go into very dark depressions sometimes and have considered suicide a few times but realistically I don’t think I will do it.

Anxiety,You aren’t dying. ,"There are so so so many of us that suffer from anxiety  health anxiety too. This savage beast will literally tear you apart and make you question things about your well being. Because of either panic attacks  24/7 symptoms  or both  you’ll think you’re legitimately dying all the time. Not only does this create more symptoms  but you’ll unfortunately never break out of the anxious-symptoms-anxious cycle because of this. If you’re trying to tough it out or face your anxiety without medication and haven’t tried it before  my suggestion is that you speak with your doctor and try them out. These medications can be world-changing for some when dosed properly and taken long enough. One of the best ways I’ve found that relieves my health anxiety is positive thinking. Even if you don’t feel like it  start listing things in your head or out loud what you’re grateful for. Even if it feels fake  weird  and unauthentic  keep saying things you’re grateful for  and more than likely your symptoms/worries will fade and eventually the fake gratitude will start to feel real. Unfortunately though  the anxiety can still slip through at times. 
   Start journaling your symptoms  list the date and time. List them over and over  no matter how many times they occur  so that when they happen again months or years from now  you can look at the list and realize you aren’t dying. The symptoms have never caused you harm. They may be terrifying  but you’ve dealt with them for literal months and years  and they never once have harmed you  nor have those horrifying health fears come to fruition. I won’t reassure you too much  one day we’re all going to die  so I can’t  nor can you  say with absolute certainty that *we aren’t really dying*. We all technically are.

Anxiety,My anxiety is ruining my life  making my family hate me  and I’m debating dropping out of college because of it ,"I’ve always been an anxious person but after a medical emergency I experienced alone with no support while away at college about 3 years ago has made it exponentially worse. I’ve tried therapy. Didn’t help. I’ve tried pharmaceutical and holistic anxiety medications. Didn’t help. It just keeps getting worse and worse and I don’t think I can take it anymore. 

I’m a senior in college and I should be graduating in May of next year and I wanted to go to grad school after that. But I don’t know how much longer I can do school while dealing with this paralyzing anxiety. I’m barely taking care of myself. It’s hard to maintain basic hygiene  feed myself  complete assignments  etc. I’ve been losing like 5 pounds a week because I’m only ever able to muster up the energy to eat one meal a day if I’m lucky. I’m seriously contemplating dropping out of college because it’s just getting too hard. I just wanna be back at home with my family where I know I’m safe and there’s someone there to watch out for me. I go to school out of state and several hours away from my hometown so commuting is not an option for me. I live alone in a studio apartment and I hate it. I worked so hard at multiple jobs to be able to afford to pay my rent in full only for my apartment to feel like my own personal hell/prison. I have no friends and no support system here at college and I just feel so isolated which makes my anxiety significantly worse. I’ve tried making friends on campus but it never works and it seems to be an impossible and hopeless feat. I had an emotional support cat that I had since I was a teenager and that lived with me in college for a year and helped my anxiety. He was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer over a year ago and he got really  really sick and had to be put down at the end of July just a couple weeks before I moved back to school. It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do. He was my best friend and big source of anxiety relief for me and now that he’s gone I feel exceptionally anxious  lost  and alone. 

My anxiety has also been driving a wedge between my mother and I. My mom is my best and pretty much my only friend. I unfortunately have a bad habit of seeking/needing reassurance from her when my anxiety is really bad or I’m having a panic attack and feel like I’m dying. My anxiety and panic attacks are the worst at night and so I’m often calling or texting her later at night when she’s asleep to make sure I’m ok and I’m just having a panic attack and not actually dying. When I do this she expresses her frustration with me and tells me that constantly seeking reassurance from her is abusive. I don’t disagree with her but in the moment I’m so scared that all I can think to do is call my mom. She also threatens to turn her phone off for the night so I can’t contact her which makes me panic even more to the point of hyperventilating and nearly making myself sick. I recognize that this is hurting my relationship with her but she’s the only support system I have. I know I’m an adult now and should be able to handle my problems myself (which is what she tells me) but in the moment I’m just so terrified that I feel like I have no other option. 

My mom has told me that I essentially need to get over myself and suck it up so I don’t blow my chance at getting my degree. I want to get my degree and I know I’m so close to the finish line but I just don’t think I can make it. I wish I was able to relax and enjoy my last year at college and living by myself in a town that I’ve grown very fond of but my anxiety is making it impossible. I just don’t know what to do anymore and I just want to move back home but I’ve already prepaid my full years worth of rent and I can’t get that refunded and it’s too expensive to just accept the loss. 

I don’t even really know why I’m posting this. I just feel so lost and scared and alone and I’m desperate to feel better in one way or another. Has anyone else experienced something similar to this. How can I calm down and enjoy my last year of college without destroying my relationship with the one person in my support system? I want nothing more than to feel normal and not have the burden of anxiety on my shoulders but it feels completely impossible.

Anxiety,what’s the worst anxiety/panic attack you’ve ever had?,"I’ll go first. Back in November I was heading back to my house after dropping off some friends. I suddenly had a horrible heat flash out of no where and my hands started going numb. This was terrifying since I was driving at night  and I was still about 10 minutes from being home. I had to pull over because my entire body went numb and I entered a really bad derealization episode. I was 100% sure I was dying because I literally could not breathe and it felt like my lungs had collapsed. I became insanely nauseous and was super close to throwing up  but luckily I didn’t. There wasn’t even a specific trigger that I can pinpoint  which is honestly super frustrating. I had several panic attacks that have brought me similar symptoms  but this was definitely the worst since I was alone and it was around 10 PM. Panic attacks can be SO scary and make you feel like you are dying. They are literally the worst.

Also  sometimes I cannot sleep  I don't have any of anxiety symptons  just not sleep. My therapist says it's because I'm anxious  but I don't feel it.

3- How can I figure out if it's actually anxiety that keeps me awake?

I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I currently take venlafaxina (depression + anxiety) + mirtazapina (for sleep)  I mostly have insomnia from depression  low neuro-transmistters. But sometimes I cannot sleep  even taking meds.

I wanted to share something that happened yesterday. I've been dealing with anxiety for years  but I've always managed to keep it under wraps at work. Yesterday  during a team meeting  I felt it building up the rapid heartbeat  the dizziness  the overwhelming urge to flee.

Before I knew it  I was hyperventilating in front of everyone. I was mortified. I thought  ""Great  now everyone knows I'm a mess.""

But then something unexpected happened. My boss calmly ended the meeting and sat down next to me. She didn't bombard me with questions or make a scene. She just said  ""It's okay. Let's take a walk.""

We went outside  and she shared that her sister also struggles with anxiety. She told me to take the rest of the day off and offered resources our company provides for mental health.

I always thought showing vulnerability at work was a weakness  but her kindness showed me otherwise. If you're struggling  please know that there are people who will understand.

Anxiety,My Uber driver had a panic attack mid-ride. Here's what happened.,"It was early afternoon and I had summoned an Uber driver from my home to take me to a friends house to watch some basketball about 25-30 minutes away.

He arrives  greetings were fine  asked me how my day was  standard stuff. Not much talking between us  and honestly I don't mind. Car was clean as well!

&#x200B;

About 20 minutes into our drive I notice he's sort of glancing in the rearview at me like he wants to say something  he starts kind of breathing deep breaths and says: ""Sorry I have to pull over."" I reply: ""Ok is everything alright?."" He says ""Sorry having a panic attack.""

I remained calm and told him  ""Ok that's fine man  I have panic attacks too  I'm not going anywhere important  take your time.""

Luckily he was able to pullover  we were in a residential area with a hill next to us and side walk.

He wasn't really speaking much at this point and I told him: ""I know when I have these attacks I like to be alone  don't worry I'm not in a hurry  I'll be over here on the curb playing games on my phone take your time  let me know if you want to call anyone.""

&#x200B;

About 20-30 minutes later  I told him I could drive him the rest of the way so he could finish his trip and make money  he said to give him a few more minutes. He was able to calm down enough to drive us. We arrived fine  I tipped him told him this is my number if he needs to talk with someone with anxiety as well and went on our ways.

Anxiety,My anxiety has faded but I feel so empty without it,"I'm a 22F who's been struggling with varying degrees of anxiety since middle school. Up till past few months  I realized the panicky feeling I normally get when walking around in public or speaking to people just abruptly vanished. Leaving my dorm for counseling appointment was overwhelming in itself  let alone hanging out with close friends  but now there's just this void.

I haven't changed any of my habits  but there was a notable change. I had mentioned this to the counselor at my uni  but he basically said why worry about what made it disappear and to just enjoy its absence.

It was probably due to how to explained it  but I ended up leaving that appointment feeling stuck. That this was a big deal to me  but maybe I was overreacting to something I should've been celebrating.

But anyways  the biggest issue I have with this sudden shift is that there's odd restlessness I'm struggling to put words to. It's like I'm desperately trying to find something wrong or figure out what I'm feeling. I'm not angry or sad  I just feel like there's something off and I can't stop looking for it.

But I feel worse than I've ever felt before. I don't really know how to explain it but I'm going to try.

These last few months I've increasingly begun to feel more empty and hollow. Hardly anything truly excites me anymore  I used to be able to get so into things  so much inspiration and drive. But it's gone  I feel like it's missing. I can do *stuff*  boring tasks  work  study  I can do it. But I feel nothing  I don't feel proud or fulfilled  even when I do great on a test for example. I just do the things I need to do because I need to. But worse  I can hardly enjoy or get myself to do the things I used to love. Especially gaming and reading  I have to force myself. I want to enjoy it so bad  but it doesn't really work most of the time.

Besides that I'm so anxious  but not... Consciously? More subconscious I think. My head isn't filled with anxious thoughts  but I can feel my body is anxious. I'm having nightmares almost every night  I grind my teeth when I sleep and I'm just tense.

My relationships are also affected. I just seem to care less and less about people  or well  I do care  but even though I care I feel so distant. I used to be socially anxious  I'm not anymore  but instead now I feel like I just can't be social anymore. I distance myself from people even though I don't want to.

Every day goes by so fast  I feel unfulfilled. I can't get myself to do the things I used to love. I don't want to die or anything  but I just don't know what I'm living for anymore and it hurts.

Once during family vacation woke up at 2am in Spain with heavy abdominal pain left side and left testicle pain. The pain was horrible  made me even vomit and got chills. Wanted to go to the Hospital  but the insurance customer servive opened only at 8am and nobody dealt with me. 2 days later flew back and went to doc who also dont knew whats going on. The pain went to only abdominal pain lower left side left side - sometimes in the middle since 5 months ago. I wake up with this pain and trying to sleep with this pain which is constant 24/7. Got antibiotics  ct  anti inflammatorys and got cope too. The result was small ulcers in my sigmoid because of the tons of meds what i got. After a few month my next constant pain appeared. 

I just did some streches  excercises and my left ear became clogged somehow with low pain. After a week i got still this weird sensation but w mild pain so went to the doc who said probably lymp node so got antibio again. 1 month later i got still everything but the pain became much more worse. They said next time probably wisdom tooth so my tooth extracted with pain ofc. 

After 3 month i still get the pain both andominal and neck - jaw - ear and face - head. I have constant back of headache  left side burning-stabbing neck pain in front around carotid artery  pain next to ear left side  dizziness  pain behind left eye  fatique  tongue pain  sore throat. 

Doctors just dont want to work or think about whats going on. 

I was 5 times at 3 different urologist  12 times at 7 different ENTs  around 10 times at 4 different GI  3 times at neurologist and abdominal CT  carotid artery US.

I felt inspired to make this post as even to this day  I am getting comments and messages on some of my previous posts about how I've made people feel better  less afraid and less alone as I've made their symptoms feel heard and like they are finally feeling safe and that what they are experiencing won't hurt them.

For small context of my story  I developed random Agoraphobia in late 2019  which escalated into very bad health anxiety through all of 2020 and some of 2021  all because of one singular panic attack. One panic attack that I misread for something serious  turned into a feedback loop of anxiety which ended up producing very scary  bizzare  and difficult symptoms. I have been free of these symptoms for what will have been over a year now as of this year after tackling my anxiety  and I'd love to help all of you feel at ease if you have any of these!

You don't have to be actively panicking or anxious to experience these  your body holds onto long-term built up anxiety/stress  it doesn't flush it all out immediately so you can experience these anytime after prolonged periods of these emotions. It gets much  much better over time.

- Dizziness (like the inside of your head is spinning but your vision isn't  sometimes to the point where you can't sit up or if you close your eyes it feels like you're spinning)

- Fuzzy Strange Head Feeling  wooziness  heaviness in the head
- Like the ground feels wobbly/like you'll fall over/like you're on a boat  like I'd fall through the floor

- Brain Zaps (without the presence of SSRI's. It'd feel like an elevator dropped inside my head  my head would 'zing' a lot  sometimes my vision would black out  my head would drop  I thought only SSRI withdrawal could do this but I found out thats not the case. I felt crazy.)

- Head Pressure or headaches (extreme pressure headaches that felt like it was constantly expanding  like I wanted to squeeze my head  so much pain  sharp pain  tension)

- Electricity feeling in the back of the neck at the base of the head (made me think I had MS)

- Derealization/Depersonalization (everything felt either too close or too far away  like everything wasn't real  looking at people felt like they were 2D cut-outs  nothing felt real or right  like the world was slipping away  this was my scariest symptom and worried it was permenant. I've never experienced it again since 2020  and I feel like my old self again)
**Edit 27th September 2023: I have finally made a big post on my DPDR recovery story  as well as advice  symptoms  reassuring facts/advice** https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/16thenk/how_i_overcame_dpdr_symptoms_feedback_loop/?

- Choking/Strangling Sensation in the throat or around the throat/gagging/globus sensation/neck tightness or stiffness

- Increased Phosphene Activity (for example  when you rub your eyes or press on closed eyes you see 'fireworks' or 'lights'  I'd see them much more at night with my eyes closed trying to sleep  and they'd sometimes make shapes or patterns)

- Hypnagogic/Hypnapompic Hallucinations (not indicative of psychosis  normal phenomenon  its when you see afterimages at night just before sleeping or the second you wake up. I'd sometimes have a digital alarm clock afterimage stuck in my vision for a minute)

- Strange pulsing light around field of vision at night after opening eyes

- Increase in Afterimages (they've severely decreased since getting better/I don't notice if I have any anymore. I used to focus on them like crazy)

- Visual Snow (had it all my life  but it felt 'increased' during my anxiety. Truth is I was just focusing on it more and now I never notice it again)

- Random black dot in vision  disappears when I look at it (I don't get this at all anymore but it used to be constant)

- Tinnitus (again  had all my life but was 'worse' during my extreme anxiety. Its since got better greatly since I felt better)

- Floaters in vision (I don't get these but these are extraordinarily common in people with anxiety)

- Chest Tightness  Chest Pain  Ectopic Beats  Palpitations  Tingling in hands

- Feeling Hungry for Air  like you can't get a full satisfying breath  shortness of breath sensation

- Sleep Paralysis Increase

- Lots of random pain  soreness in any part of the body suddenly  ranges from sharp to dull  just always in pain one way or another (I'd get zygomatic pain  to my neck being tender)

- Tense jaw  like it couldn't relax

- Stomach pain  stomach upsetness  nausea  bowel urgency

- Feeling like your speech is slurred  slow or like your brain is lagging

- Increased Vivid dreams  hyperawareness of sleep sensations (such as racing train of thought  nonsense thoughts as your brain winds down for sleep)  hypnic jerks

- Eye Pain/eye pressure  pain moving eyes around  pain in the socket

- Random feelings of dread  feeling like you are about to die/something is wrong

These are just some of the symptoms I remember off the top of my head  definitely leave comments if there's any you're experiencing that I haven't noted as I can also try to let you know if I had those symptoms  or if other Redditors have!

It took me longer than I'd like to admit that these are just symptoms of anxiety and not something greater; I was a non-stop Googler of every symptom and sensation and decided I had every disease under the sun like Meniere's Disease  MS  brain tumours  schizophrenia (even though I had absolutely no symptoms of it) etc. I felt like I was going to be like this forever  it affected me everyday of my waking life  I kept a diary everyday of my symptoms and how I felt until one day I never wrote in it again because I never had anything to write about. I got better  it gets better  you are all safe  you are not alone.

I'd be super happy to answer any questions  or to help any of you feel assured so please feel free to leave anything by that could get you the help or support you need.

**Edit (27th September 2023)**

**I have made a large post like this one  about my recovery from DPDR and how I managed it. I had a lot of questions and message requests based on this symptom alone and how I combatted it  but I'm struggling to reply individually to so many messages about it  so here it is:**

**Please give that post a look if you are curious about DPDR recovery  its symptoms  how it can start and some reassuring advice on it**

**Edit 2 (17th January 2024)**
Hiya everyone!

I just wanted to say thank you so much to all of you who are still using this place as a resource  and a safe place to come to me for advice and reassurance!

**For future reference I'd really recommend that if any of you have questions  or need advice  that you reply to this thread instead of sending me private messages and I'll explain why!**

1. Its easier & faster for me to get back to you! When you make a comment I get a notification which allows me to see your concerns instantly. **When a private message is sent  it immediately goes into my 'Message Requests' which I never get a notification for and have to actively remember to check it everyday (which can be hard!). I've got over 40 message requests now  which has left me quite swamped and feeling helpless because I didn't see them sooner and don't know where to start/if I can. So I'd really recommend at least leaving a comment first in the thread before messaging me privately. I want to help!**

2. Leaving a comment means that other people can read your questions  and they can also read my answers! This allows people to find answers to their questions easier as they may have the same question in their minds that has been asked before  and they can find that its been asked & answered. This stops a flood of repeat questions  and allows public access of all the information and experiences I can provide. **It is absolutely imperative to me that all of the information  advice and questions here remain completely public  free of charge and can be revisitable.**

3. **I can understand some of what you may want to talk about is more private/personal  so in this case please leave a comment requesting to message me and allow me to give you permission to message me before you send a private message.** This allows me to remember to check my message requests  and confirms that I can give you the attention and shoulder to lean on that you may need. There are times I will be absent due to personal commitments and real life  so I want to be able to reassure you on when I have the time to get back to you.

Again  I just wanted to say thank you and that I am insanely grateful for and proud of everyone here. I hope you know this is written in good faith and not to shame anybody  **I just want to help all of you as much as I can so making it easier to navigate and accessible means that more people can get the help they need x**",548,549,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/10jcfko/longterm_anxiety_symptoms_i_had_from_someone_who/
Anxiety,3 cups of coffee sent me on a 9 hour panic attack and put me in the ER. It's insane,"I knew caffeine could affect your anxiety  but I didn't know it could be THAT bad.

So  the story is that I went to a job interview with a CEO of a company  who took me to a fancy coffee place. I was already tense cause of the meeting  but had downed a benzo before it  so I thought I would be ok.

The meeting dragged out for 3 hours  which was a good thing  cause the guy liked me  but he also wanted to buy me different kinds of expensive coffee  and we ended up on 3 cups in a row.
After the 3rd cup I got a really bad heartburn. I am obese and have had reflux issues for years  so I knew it was coming  but it has never been this bad before. My whole chest was on fire.

I struggled to keep conversation while trying to keep my stomach content. Then things started to spin and my anxiety was triggered. Luckily the guy had to go  so we parted ways. At this point the world was rotating and my chest was killing me  so I tried my best at keeping balance and sticking to the walls.

An hour later I returned home  and my anxiety levels kept growing until I entered a full blown panic attack which lasted for another 3 hours. I was hoping it would calm dowm once my wife got home. The heartburn had gotten worse too and my chest pains spread to my shoulders and jaw. I remember my wife coming home and I got up from my seat to greet her. Next thing I know I am in ambulance. My wife told me that I simply collapsed after getting up.

My blood pressure at that time was around 210/114

I was rushed to the ER  where they could find nothing wrong with me other than my blood pressure and the fact that I was in a state of panic.
They spent the next few hours pumping me with antiacids and benzos.
After a high enough dosage  by BP finally began to drop and my panic attack stopped.
All of this lasted 9 hours...

3 f*cking cups of coffee. That's all it took...",561,120,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1el6yet/3_cups_of_coffee_sent_me_on_a_9_hour_panic_attack/
Anxiety,What is the last resort for severe anxiety (alive)?,"My body is in 24 hour fight or flight mode. Heart palpitations  chest pain  sleeplessness  muscle tension  chronic inflammation  and discomfort all over my body  butterflies sensation in my stomach/chest. Always EXHAUSTED. Just a percentage of the symptoms I experience on a day-to-day basis. I can’t focus and I don’t know how much longer I can keep my job. I can’t even exercise because my heart palpitations. And I don’t want to be around anyone.

I don’t want to end my life  but I’ve tried pretty much every treatment out there  including TMS  psychotherapy  outpatient intensive rehab  medication  meditation  you name it..

Is this all there is? The only other thing I can think of is ECT  but I don’t want to be a vegetable. I have heard that it is more for depression than anxiety. 

Does anybody have any answers? Is there anyone who feels they have hit rock bottom with anxiety? I don’t know how much more I can physically take. This is not a happy life..


Edit: Thank you for all of your kind words and suggestions. I hope we can all find peace and happiness :). ",176,239,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/18kyoij/what_is_the_last_resort_for_severe_anxiety_alive/
Anxiety,Just parked at the ER for a while then left.,"A couple years ago I had a little stint of getting anxiety and going to the ER  only a few times but it cost a fair bit of money. Of course every time they did an EKG and I was fine.

Tonight though I was feeling my standard symptoms of left arm tingling and pain  chest discomfort  also had some nausea which was a little less common for me. I did get that feeling of “impending doom” for like 5 seconds or so and that convinced me to drive to the ER to at least park for a while.

Previously this would end with me going into the ER  getting told I’m fine  feeling like an idiot and getting an annoying bill. But this time I asked myself “what about this time is different?” I went through how I was feeling and how it compared to the other times. I ended up not letting my anxiety control me and I drove home! Very happy with my decision because now I feel completely fine  just wanted to share!

Anxiety,My girlfriend needs time apart me and the idea of not being with her is causing me so much pain that I don’t think I want to exist with this amount of pain and anxiety.,"I’m 25 (male) and me and my partner (24F) have been together for over 3 and half years and she has recently decided that she needs time alone. 

I have been suffering from bad anxiety for the past 7 years and have recently been diagnosed with OCD. I have served attachment and abandonment issues due to trauma from my childhood. I have only recently come to understand the full extent of this and realised why I have made some foolish mistakes in the past. 

Early on in the relationship  I cheated on my girlfriend with my ex because of this anxiety about being abandoned and I needed some kind of affection as I was losing my mind. This is not an excuse. At all. And I regret it everyday and do my best to try and work on myself to be a better person and try and self soothe instead of needing bad ways to deal with my pain. 
I made some more bad mistakes such as sending messages to people because I was craving attention due to my anxiety of being abandoned. Again  this was not ok. 

I am in a much better place and I have a much better understanding of who I am and my triggers. I’m better at self soothing but I have a long way to go. 

My partner knows everything as I wanted to be truthful to her. Of course  this caused her so much pain and we have been trying to make things work since. 

It came to a head though yesterday and now is wanting this time away from me. I will still see her in my workplace  we will message and I will occasionally see her outside of work too. She wants to help me. 

But the problem is that the idea of her not living with me now and me being alone is TERRIFYING me. I have never felt this level of fear and anxiety before in my life and I can’t keep it together. I’ve tried telling her that I really need her and I don’t think I will be able to do this but she has told me that this is really what she wants. 

What do I do? I never want to be the person who threatens her with the idea of me harming myself to get her to stay. I haven’t threatened her but I am very scared about hurting myself. 
The anxiety and uncertainty of not knowing whether we will be together by the end of it is tearing me apart.

Anxiety,I just want to take a moment to celebrate getting over my near panic attack without having to take a ton of medication again. A lot of these posts are about people suffering but we always get over it in the end  don't we?,"I'm going to explain my situation and maybe it will help someone to read it just as much as it will help me talk about it. It will be a little TMI. 

I suffer from endometriosis  generalized anxiety disorder  and depression. There might be more undiagnosed things that I have but those are so far confirmed. As of right now I am currently bleeding out of every hole because of the scar tissue and potential kidney stones in my urinary tract  my menstrual cycle which is just started  and the anal fissures on my rectum that have split open. The pain is bad.

So I decided to take a Tramadol to help counter the pain since it was so bad I decided to take something a little more heavy-hitting instead of the Tylenol and ibuprofen combo. Unfortunately  I did not pay enough attention to the bottle to reassure myself that I didn't take the wrong medication. After the fact I had some paranoia that I had taken some wrong medication and I didn't know how I was going to feel. On top of that  I don't like how Tramadol makes me feel because it is a mild narcotic and you can feel high from it  so that buzz could have been a potential trigger in itself.

Queue the panic attack.

I called the nurse hotline right away. I needed to know if I could take my anxiety medicine with this Tramadol in case I spiraled. When I have a panic attack they're so severe I have to basically sedate myself in order for it to stop. So what I usually do is start off with taking one 12.5mg of Promethazine to target the nausea and the pill can make me feel a little bit sleepy which will help a little bit with anxiety. If I can't get my anxiety to calm down I'll also take one 25 mg of Hydroxyzine and hopes that that will do the trick. When I know the attack is going to be bad I will take both of them at the same time. Worst case scenario I will also take 5 mg of Diazepam after the first two pills don't work  and if I'm lucky I won't have to take any more and I'll fall asleep from meditating and doing breathing exercises.

The problem is I took Tramadol and I don't know how these medications react to it  so I didn't want to start swallowing pills because the biggest side effect with taking anxiety medication with other medication is respiratory failure.

It didn't take long for my doctor to call me back even though it felt like several lifetimes in the moment. He talked me through and let me know that we're light years (away his words) from being in trouble taking this medication  at these doses  with Tramadol. So the plan was to start off with the Promethazine and work my way up to Hydroxyzine and the Diazepam and if I have to.

Just knowing that I could take this medication with the Tramadol got me to calm down. Not right away  I did take the Promethazine and watch some YouTube videos about anxiety to help distract me and make me feel a little bit better. It's been about an hour since and I still feel pretty weary  and I've had my bowels lose their shit literally and it was very painful...

But I'm not having an attack right now.

Right now I don't have to take more medicine and I'm crossing my fingers that I won't have to later tonight if it comes back. The Tramadol didn't actually help get rid of the pain completely and I think next time I'm not going to take this for my Endometriosis and instead try and take Tylenol and Ibuprofen and maybe substitute one of those with Motrin. I have the Tramadol prescribed to me for this pain  but because of this experience of having me think twice. 

Sharing this experience helps me even though it's embarrassing because it's on my public Reddit profile. But my anxiety is getting worse and I don't want to have to hide it from the world so I'm going to keep this up to look back on

Hopefully you  reader  will benefit from reading this in any way whatsoever.

Anxiety,Dizziness  heavy body  weird random head pains/pressure and “full” ears and weird unfocused sometimes blurry vision....anxiety? Or more?,"UPDATE TO THIS POST (2/29/24):

Hi everyone. I get a lot of questions still about this post so I just wanted to give an update to my most asked questions and my overall input on it all now. 

1. Did I ever figure out what was wrong? Not exactly however  I had plenty of doctor visits and tests done to know it is not something life threatening  including a CT scan and even completing a lot of dental work. What I realized was that I needed to manage my anxiety because it can create the very real physical symptoms I felt  which creates more anxiety  and that vicious cycle just continues. 

2. Do I still have these symptoms? Occasionally yes. But I do not experience them all. 

3. I strongly encourage you all to look into TMJD and how that can create so many of these symptoms  cause sinus issues  inner ear issues and like I said contributes to your anxiety. I noticed more and more since this post how much I was clenching and grinding my teeth even in the middle of the day and also please consider that antidepressants can CAUSE TMJD. It is a pain in the butt  however it isn’t life threatening. 

4. Know that you don’t have to believe every single negative thought your mind tells you. Trust in your doctors  trust your body. You know you best. 

Much love you guys. ♥️ 

End of update. 


25(f) 

Okay so let me start by saying I already know I have anxiety/OCD and depression. I’ve been diagnosed  I’m on Zoloft 75 mg for around two months now. I’ve been on it total since March 7th.

However  I just feel like my body is trying to talk to me with all of this. I’ve been on the meds for so long  how can I still be having these extreme physical symptoms of anxiety? 

I feel like I’m “on a boat” or the “drunk” type feeling a good majority of the time when I’m up and moving but sometimes even sitting or laying too. It mostly goes away when I’m working out or something. 

I dont fall over but it definitely GIVES me more anxiety  of course. And it just makes me miserable. 

Like I said I also feel head pressure and pain that sometimes comes and goes quickly and ear fullness and sometimes pressure/pain in my eye or eyes. My vision seems unfocused and blurry sometimes too. Have had them checked  fine other than my normal vision problems. My eye doctor said the antidepressant can cause weird eye movement. Is she right? 

Other weird symptoms  I feel like my hands feel “numb” and tingling sometimes. Like as I’m typing this my pinky finger feels numb. 

In the beginning (so back in February) I had all the blood work  ekgs  etc. done. All fine. Never had my head looked at though. 

Could this be a tumor? Brain damage? Aneurysm? Stroke? Idk. Like I said  just feel like my body being so unwell is trying to talk to me. And I just don’t know if I should look deeper. 

Any help appreciated. 

Also should mention I had a moderate case of covid back in end of January. 

I also have Hashimoto’s  sub clinical (I .e. Not on meds) hypothyroidism. But I’m heading to a functional medicine doctor next week to start figuring that treatment out. 

Idk. Just feel like feeling this way daily isn’t right. 🙃",176,296,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/wb64pk/dizziness_heavy_body_weird_random_head/
Anxiety,I desperately need a break from my own mental hell,"I am so sick and tired of constantly ruminating about mistakes and feeling like shit 24/7. I need a break from my own mental hell because I'm just so exhausted. My grades are dropping because I lack motivation  and my anxiety keeps me up  so I'm constantly sleep deprived. 

I've made so many fuck ups and I wish I could turn back the clocks and just be a kid again. I used to be so happy  and I miss the life I had when I was a childish little girl that wasn't so fucked up and my biggest concern was the colour of my lipgloss.
I mourn the life i could've had.I wish I had if I just had a little more guidance growing up  a mentor  or perhaps someone just to stop me from being such a recluse 

I've lost all those years  and although they were happy  I didn't cherish them  and now they've literally dissolved right in front of my eyes  and it crushes me to think back

I think about my mother alot and how much she used to hold and hug me before and tell me that everything was going to be okay and I mourn that too  because I'm older now and our relationship just isn't that anymore.

I constantly worry about the future and ""what ifs"" my future looks so bleak  and with the things I have done  I don't know how I'll ever be normal again. I want a do over so bad  but it's all gone.

I AM not a strong soilder  nor am I resilient  and I don't pretend to be. My daily mental anguish is debilitating  and I feel myself cracking under the pressure. I CAN NOT ENDURE. The thought of having to live live this is disgustin   and I'd rather die   but I can't do that to my family  especially my mother
My past is filled with pain  and I wish I could relive it yet start over at the same time. My present is filled with ENDLESS worries about the worst possible outcome. I fear that if people find out about the horrific skeleton in my closet  I'd be disowned  looked at with disgust  and more. And I can't deal with that. I'm not strong  and I can't power through it. I'm sensitive  and my life wasn't supposed to be this way. I will be and AM at my wits end. My future just looks like endless suffering until my parents die  and I can off myself without the knowledge that I'll be leaving my parents who have sustained me for years in pain.

I just don't even know anymore. I've tried sleeping tablets to try sleep days away  but I can't. I've been feeling this way for AGES  and I am JUST SO DONE. I feel like a fraud. I just need a break. I'm still a late teen  and it'll take months of being on a waiting list before I'm even CONSIDERED for some kind of help. I seriously don't know

Anxiety,Does anyone feels like antidepressants has made you worse.,"So the go to for doctors is SSRIs & SNRIs for anxiety and depression  from a person who in the last year has been on Venlafaxine  Citalopram  Escitalopram  Duloxetine & Vorteoxitine they do not work one bit for crippling anxiety.

These medications I feel have caused way more harm than good  weight gain like crazy  bad Nausea  fatigue etc  not to mention trying to come off them is an absolute nightmare the brain zaps are excruciating so I had to go back on them.

Before antidepressants I had really bad anxiety followed by depression  but over a year on my nerves feel like they are fucked  all day every day my skin is hypersensitive to touch  clothes are uncomfortable to wear  it's really bad on my legs and tighs  I never had this problem in my life.

I really feel trying so many antidepressants messed up my nervous system and now I am stuck like this. I was on Pregabalin for months for the pain but no joy.

Even now I just started 5mgs of Diazepams and it's doing nothing for this feeling.

It feels like pins and needles  Electric running through my body or burning sensation.

I wonder if its because I am.on Mirtazapine and another antidepressant and maybe it's causing too much serotonergic issues on my body  I feel so debilitated this way it makes me want to end my life.

Anxiety,i'm so frustrated. why won't doctors listen to me? it feels like nobody understands. i feel so alone,"TLDR : i have anxious intrusive thoughts and my doctor prescribed me benzos without even telling me what they were or what they do  thankfully i did research before taking them. (no offense to anyone who takes benzos btw  im glad they work for you!) now i'm doing my own research to try and find a med that will help me so i can tell him i want to take it  because i don't trust him anymore. (i'm moving in a few months so there's no use it finding a new doctor atm). i feel so alone like nobody understands. any advice or support or anything would be greatly appreciated <3 thank you!



I feel like nobody is listening to me and nobody understands and i feel so alone. ( sorry for the repeated sentence).  I have intrusive thoughts. like getting stabbed or shot  people breaking into my work or my house. thinking about people hating me and leaving me and ruining my life. it mostly manageable  i can still go about every day. but i've noticed that it's so exhausting and takes a lot of my mental energy. being anxious all the time sucks. it seems to mostly impact my relationship  probably due to trauma from my previous relationships. i always think my boyfriend's going to leave me  he doesn't love me anymore  or that i upset him all the time and im too much to handle. as for work  i'm so paranoid of doing the wrong thing or making mistakes. and then the intrusive thoughts on top of that is just alot. i hadn't realized how much this was affecting me until recently.  
i've had the same psychiatrist for probably 3 years now. he prescribes me my antidepressants and sleep meds and i haven't had any complaints with those thus far.  and honestly i normally just go in  sit there  and then he gives me my medicine. i don't like him very much at all  im just doing what i cant to get my medicine. i've wanted a new psychiatrist for awhile but never found a new one  maybe that's my issue here. but i'm moving with my family across the USA in a couple months and there's no use it finding a new one now. i figured i'd just wait until we moved to talk to somebody but i decided to give it a shot and try talking to him. the first time i told him about my anxiety and wanting to be put on anxiety meds  it seemed to go very well. i told him  he said ok  and put me on a medicine (buspirone). Well that didn't work  it could've been my bad sleep schedule but i got very depressed and arguably more anxious. my sleep schedule has been bad before though and didn't feel like that. i told him i don't want to keep taking that one. he randomly asks me if i think i have adhd and i said ""well my grandma had it so idk maybe"" and he asked me if i wanted to get tested and i said ""sure""  did the test  he didn't tell me my results. i had to ask him what they were. he asked if i wanted to go on adhd meds BEFORE EVEN TELLING ME MY RESULTS and then he said ""well there's some indicators of adhd but not a ton. do you think your anxiety is caused by not being able to focus"" i said no. WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK ME THAT BEFORE I TOOK THE ASSESMENT?? i asked if there was another anxiety med and he prescribed me on klonopin. didn't even tell me the risks  what it does  nothing. just told me some common side effects like dizziness and lightheadedness and told me to call if anything like that happened. i told my therapist about them and she mentioned something about them being strong. then i did my research to find out their benzos. he said nothing about addiction or anything. i have a very addictive personality. i was addicted to self harm for years  finally got out of that about 2 years ago now. almost all of my father's siblings are addicts of some kind. hell  my parents even drink a lot. i was about to take highly addictive pills and not even know it. (if klonopin or any other benzos work for you then that's great! i hope nobody thinks im putting them down because that's not at all what im trying to do. I'm so frustrated that he didn't even bother to tell me or ask  let alone even ask me how my anxiety manifests. i can easily sit here and blame myself for not being more clear with him about how i'm feeling  i do have anxiety after all  but i'm still so angry with him. it's my body and hen should tell me about what i'm putting in it.

now i'm left here doing my own research on what medication can help intrusive thoughts. probably gonna make another appointment and tell him i don't want to take those and suggest another medicine  and i'm assuming he'll just give it to me. I could also make an appointment with my primary doctor or just wait unitl i move. about the meds  i'm leaning towards zoloft (Sertraline)  i took that a few years ago but that was when my depression was really bad  now i'm just trying to fix the anxiety and intrusive thought's because the depression is under control. i think he had originally suggested that but i had told him i had taken it before  i hadn't considered the fact that it might help me now. i'm just really nervous to possibly have an adverse effect.   
literally any advice or support or ANYTHING would be greatly appreciated. if you read all this  thank you so much. i genuinely appreciate it so much more then you know <3",1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1iv82zh/im_so_frustrated_why_wont_doctors_listen_to_me_it/
Anxiety,Nobody understands me because I can't express my feelings,I have social anxiety. But I couldn't explain it to my family. Because I would have to go to a psychologist  and money would be paid just for me. My family will definitely tell my relatives about this  and everyone's perspective on me will change. And frankly  I don't think I can honestly explain how I feel to my family. When there is an activity  I don't want to participate in it  because I feel really bad. My hands start to get cold  my body shakes  I feel nauseous. That's why I don't want to. But my family is trying to get me to participate  and so I do. I get angry. Then they tell me I'm ungrateful.I am fed up.,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1hh2i93/nobody_understands_me_because_i_cant_express_my/
Anxiety,Do any of you have intense health anxiety? I feel like nobody understands me,"I am writing here solely with the intention of venting and seeing if any of you can relate to me  because at least for me   having this type of anxiety has been a very isolated experience. 

So  before starting I just want to say that I’m not here to talk about specific symptoms  so please  I’d appreciate if you don’t do the same too! I don’t want anyone to feel triggered by reading other’s symptoms  and I don’t want to feel triggered too. 

I’ve been dealing with anxiety for over 5 years  specially social anxiety  but in the last 2 years  I’ve developed a severe health anxiety  and honestly; it’s the worst type of anxiety I’ve ever felt in my whole life. 

I started to have symptoms and since I searched on the internet  the worst diseases that I could ever imagine came out. This issue has caused me severe derealization and panic attacks and it’s not a joke. 
It’s honestly one of the worst feelings ever  it feels like my life is ending and I’m losing control over myself. I feels hopeless  and the uncertainty is killing me. I’ve stopped future plans because I literally think I’m dying  sometimes I don’t sleep at night because I’m deeply afraid of dying on my sleep. Basically  this thing is consuming my life and I don’t know how to stop it. There are times where I’m better and I try to be okay  but there are other moments when it consumes me completely. 

The worst thing is that I feel really lonely  every time I talk about this  it seems that no one understand me  they think I’m just a dramatic person  even my therapist… so I feel I’m alone on this. 

Does any of you feel the same? I feel like I'm the only one in the world dealing with this.
I know I’m probably not  but that's how it feels sometimes. 

That’s all I have to say  I hope y’all see this. And I apologize for my bad English  I’m not a native speaker.

Anxiety,this subreddit crucifies benzos when they saved my life,"it’s so frustrating coming on to an ANXIETY subreddit and seeing benzos being stigmatized. 

*TW* suicidal ideation

i’m a 22 year old high school and college dropout due to severe panic disorder  agoraphobia  and GAD. i have never held a steady job. i live my life convinced i’m going to die daily. i wake up panicky  and a lot of times i go to sleep wondering if i’ll die during it. my panic attacks are atypical— they last for hours  coming in waves. i have lost substantial amounts of weight during bad “flareups”. i have had severe suicidal ideation because the thought of taking my own life seemed easier than living in constant fear. i have been on Prozac  Lexapro  Celexa  Zoloft  Paxil  Pristiq  Cymbalta  Lamotrigine  Abilify  Risperdal  Seroquel  Zyprexa  and a couple more off label medications since i was 12. i have tried EMDR  CBT  IOP  and have been inpatient. i’ve seen a therapist since i was 10. so please  don’t you dare tell me that there’s no place for benzos when they’re the only things that make me feel normal.

i started taking 1 mg lorazepam as needed when i was 12. i hardly took it; drug addiction runs in my family. but living was a struggle. as i developed and became more mature  my anxiety got substantially worse. i was prescribed 7 pills every 3 months. however  when the pandemic hit and i was in my psychiatrist’s office shaking inconsolably  i was given 1 pill a day to keep me out of emergency rooms  since that is where my panic attacks would often make me end up. for the first time in a long time  i felt normal. i started my first job as a doordasher. on benzos  i felt like any other 20 something with their whole life ahead of them. for the first time  i saw what it was like to live without fear. 

in the last 2 and a half years  i have built a tolerance and my dose has had to be upped by another mg. however  i fight every day to take less than the dosage given. i’m exhausted because i spend all of my time convincing myself i’m not going to die. but when i finally give in and take what i’m prescribed  i feel like i can do anything a normal person can do.

i’m terrified of withdrawal  of course i am. but my psychiatrist (who is seeing that the medicinal options are starting to run out)  decided that giving me daily benzos would give me a substantially better quality of life. it is not ideal. of course it’s not. he made that clear as well. i know about the scary withdrawals and the memory loss (which i thankfully haven’t really experienced) that comes from long term use. give me a different option and i’ll try anything. 

but you know what? if this is what i need to live a fulfilled life  then fuck it. this is what i’ll do. since on it  i’ve been able to travel without my parents  earn my own money  enjoy my life  and cultivate a healthy relationship. i’m tired of how stigmatized benzos are. i’m tired of coming onto this subreddit and seeing how they’re the devil’s drug— worse than heroin and feeling guilty for needing it. 

trust me  nobody would choose this. but i’d rather live a shorter fulfilled life needing benzos than live a long life filled with constant fear and anxiety.

edit: i continue to get replies and messages so i wanted to give an update. it has been 2 years since my post. a little while after i wrote this  i was prescribed pristiq and ended up getting serotonin syndrome as i apparently absorb SSRIs/SNRIs unusually— which is why they always did more harm than good for me. i was told i should never take serotonin again  which has made benzo accessibility quite easy and has helped all my doctors understand why i take them daily. i am no longer stigmatized for it in my day to day life. 

i continue to take 2 mg a day  and have gotten my life back. i now travel the country and the world  go out daily  and have just picked out my engagement ring (when he proposes is the surprise). benzos work as an aid  but i don’t rely on them anymore. progressive muscle relaxation is the number 1 thing that has helped me outside of benzos and exposure therapy. i have no adverse affects like memory loss  cognitive decline  balance issues  etc. obviously  it’s no one’s first choice  but i’m back to loving my life and it’s at least in part due to benzos. do what’s best for you  advocate for yourself  and i will continue to reply to any questions. all love!",785,291,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/y9p3sc/this_subreddit_crucifies_benzos_when_they_saved/
Anxiety,"Nobody understands that ""normal"" life things are difficult for me due to anxiety","I was venting to friends that I feel way too much anxiety about doing ""basic"" life things like taking a driving test  applying for a job. I told them I cannot handle it  physically I feel sick even thinking about it  my heart races  near spiral into panic attack. I just can't put myself through it  the anxiety is crippling.. I would rather never get my license and never change jobs ever again.

My friends looked at me like I was crazy and said ""huh? it's easy tho"" and ""its not that bad  why are you making it a big deal.."". In that moment I felt weak.. they will never understand what anxiety disorder is like. I'm sure they get ""healthy"" anxiety. But not like me... being so stressed and scared and worried about things to the point where I won't do it at all  getting panic attacks.. losing sleep for days/weeks over one single event.

With my last driving test  I had anxiety every day for 2 weeks prior. I couldn't sleep. On the day of  I had into a panic attack  shaking and crying  I almost threw up. Then I failed my test and sobbed. Even though driving tests are ""no big deal"" to normal people  it's something that makes my anxiety so so terrible. I refuse to take another test.

I even had anxiety for the last 4 days because I had to send a work email and I was so anxious that I couldn't press Send until today.

Anxiety,Nobody understands me  I feel completely alone. I’m so scared and lost.,"Can somebody please tell me what to do? I just started college today  i’m going to become a nurse. About 6 months ago  i acquired GAD which was diagnosed by my doctor. i could not move from my bed for a whole month without having severe anxiety. this led me to seek help  i got medication.

the medication (sertraline)  worked for about 5 months and now the panic attacks are back full force. i was in class today and i was sitting there having a panic attack for the whole 3 hours i was there. i have them so often that i just sit there and let it happrn  BUT IT NEVER LEAVES UNTIL IM AT MY SAFE SPACE. (which is my home or with my partner) i feel so annoyed.

my panic attacks are so severe  i get the worst symptoms imaginable.. the scariest ones. i dont know what to do.

people say to me “you’re such a pretty girl  i never would have known” or “just calm down”.  mental health problems dont discriminate... it doesnt know a gender  a race or attractiveness.

i want to do good  but my memory is completely garbage because i’m in a constant state of fight or flight.. even after school. im on high alert. i dont know what to do. i’m so incredibly stressed and overwhelmed when i shouldnt be. even when i’m “calm”  my body is still in panic.

Anxiety,I hate constantly feeling like someone is mad at me,"It’s so tiring to constantly worry and have to check with people if they are mad. It makes people feel like I make everything about myself. When in reality I just need to make sure nobody is upset. I have a constant need to be liked and loved. I know everybody pretty much wants these things. But I get sick and feel extremely horrible when I even get a slight hint that someone might be upset with me. It’s just so tiring. I hate it and I feel like I can never be completely normal. I’ve made immense progress but it’s never going to be normal again. I can’t stop feeling guilty for everything I’ve ever done. And when I confess to family members about my guilt they act like I’m worrying about nothing. 

I obsess over things that happened years ago. And can’t let them go ever. I just cannot stop obsessing over things that probably didn’t even involve me or that nobody remembers or cares about anymore. I’m tired of thoughts that I’m a horrible person. I’m just so tired of it. It gets old to never feel comfortable with myself. The only times I do is when I’m in a group of people having fun. And I’m able to make them laugh. Whenever I’m alone and that connection is gone I just panic.

At this point I’m worried that I must be high maintenance and just need a lot of attention. I just want people to like me. I literally cannot stand the thought of people hating me. And I know there’s gotta be people out there. I know and understand why people get upset at my guilty feelings and confessions. It’s just hard to stop. I feel like I need reassurance which is a short lasting fix.


Edit: I’m kinda thinking this might be because I’ve forgotten my anxiety meds for a few days. Uhhh whoops. Well im going to get back on track and see how that helps. But I’m so nervous I can’t stop hyper focusing on one situation and it’s been a year and it wasn’t even a big deal when it happened

What helps me calm down is my routine of checking if people have blocked me or not (nobody has blocked me so far) and window shopping on Mercari for squishmallows with factory errors.",959,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/or3og2/i_hate_constantly_feeling_like_someone_is_mad_at/
Anxiety,Desperately Need Success Stories for Overcoming Health Anxiety,"I have been struggling with health anxiety since my dad almost passed from a medical emergency in 2018 and I had my first panic attack. It was never bad enough for me to worry though  and I went through a handful of years without it being a problem. I started therapy for it in 2020. I would Google symptoms for years and the anxiety seemed to have almost completely gone away when I lost some weight in 2021. It crept back in slowly in 2023  but nothing that wasn't manageable. Everything changed in late 2024. I slid down a slope and into a never-ending fight or flight spiral and I am grasping at anything that will help me get out. I was just recently diagnosed with ""Pure O"" OCD.

I have continued with therapy  which will bring me momentary relief  but it hasn't been the fix-all. I have tried several medications — Lexapro (horrible reaction)  Zoloft (not good either)  and Pristiq (made my anxiety worse). I now experience random spikes of racing heart rate that I have never had before  which sent me to the ER the first time it happened out of fear. After many tests and a follow-up with a cardiologist  everything is fine. Wouldn't you think that having confirmation that I'm OK would bring me peace of mind? It doesn't. I'm still terrified that something is wrong and that I'm going to die.

I will have multiple days in a row  sometimes a week or more  where I'm totally fine. I am going about my life as normal  no anxiety symptoms  so no mental anxiety. No checking my heart rate or blood pressure. And then out of nowhere  everything is ruined by one sensation with spiraling thoughts and I tumble into a near or complete panic. I'm struggling to live alone because I'm afraid of something happening to me with nobody around. I'm constantly calling friends and family in the middle of the night because I feel like I can't breathe and I need comfort. I'm having to call off work because the sheer terror is preventing me from getting out of bed. I have near constant DP/DR that shuts me down from having a social life  but I'm doing my best to ignore it and not feed into the feelings.

I'm exhausted and frustrated and just so tired of feeling this way. I constantly pity myself and ask why this is happening to me and how it's not fair that I have to go through this because it's ruining my life. I know there is hope and a light at the end of the tunnel and it won't always be like this forever because it wasn't before  but I am struggling to keep the faith. I really need some support and motivation from those who have overcome health anxiety because I am losing hope.

Some other side notes: I cannot figure out what the trigger to this anxious cycle was back in September. I moved and started a new job over the summer and had a scary emergency with my cat on Labor day weekend  but otherwise nothing much. I had previously lost 75lbs and started gaining weight back pretty rapidly around that time  so is there a connection there? I find myself almost begging for there to be something wrong  like thyroid problems or hormonal issues  SOMETHING to be the reason for the increased anxiety with an easy and quick fix. I'm terrified to try any other medications because of the experiences I've had with the ones I've tried. I've ghosted my psychiatrist because she keeps telling me to push through the increased anxiety with the Pristiq but I can't live like that  even if it's temporary. CBD used to be my holy grail with preventing and calming anxiety  but it has stopped working for me and I don't understand why. I even took a break for many months thinking I had grown a tolerance.

Please  please share your success stories so I can try to hold onto a little bit of hope. Did medication help you? What things did you try in therapy that helped? I just want my life back.",10,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jb3x2n/desperately_need_success_stories_for_overcoming/

Anxiety,Haven’t had a job in 6 years because of mental health issues and I feel pathetic and like a total loser,"


It’s not an excuse of course because of mental health  though I had 2 very short jobs in between those years but only lasted a month or month and a half for one and the other it was too stressful I didn’t last more than 2 weeks. I feel like my days are a total waste at least especially when I’m at my parents house because I don’t drive and they are 30 mins to the first bus but they don’t like me walking it because it’s a little dangerous up a big uphill with a thin sidewalk line next to cars passing by fast with a downside that can cause you to fall into a deep forest downhill. I can’t do as much when I’m there and visit a few days out of the week  but I help around the house and try to keep busy but sometimes I’m just on my phone too much. But when I’m at my apartment that’s about 8 mins away I’m right outside 2 mins to transit and am a lot more active gone most of the day at least volunteering or doing other things  appointments or going to a mental health resource support activity and classes clubhouse. I feel like I’ve wasted a lot of years and feel like I’m not good enough or a waste of space compared to my bf who has a job and people who manage to work 2 or 3 jobs at a time when I can’t even manage one. I developed weird phobias or anxiety about even basic jobs like fast food and retail/ customer service  restaurant waitress  worried about things like grocery codes  food prep/ clumsiness with wrapping or packaging things etc or memory remembering food items or orders  or cashier working with money etc. Idk if it’s just lack of experience not having a job over a year or not having many jobs in my teens / young adults years. I’m trying to work with a job counsellor to get back into the work force or go to college for the first time. I feel like I’m the only one and like I’m not good enough in society like I’m a burden. I’m on disability since a year ago and I feel guilty sometimes though it will help me with anxiety and mental health accommodations for college if I go and other access to job trainings. I’m also worried because my bf who lives in Japan  I live in Canada is telling me that I should come on a working holiday visa in Japan for 1 year and I don’t think I’m strong enough resilient or able to do it. I want to stop spending my days doing nothing at least when I’m at my family’s house  I was going to the gym everyday before but haven’t since I got sick.

Anxiety,Feel like a burden,"
So i’ve been on sick leave from my healthcare job for a few months now due to burnout and finding out I’m likely autistic (awaiting assessment) and I have an appointment with HR to go over if I’m likely to return or if they can offer more support. Truth is I’m stuck at a crossroads.. I have anxiety thats been getting worse - panic attacks and avoiding social situations. I think being off work and practically in isolation has exacerbated this. I’m in week 3 of therapy and although its helping me identify my triggers and try to reframe those negative thoughts I still don’t know what to do with my life. 

I failed my phase return a few weeks ago due to having severe panic attacks at work and a part of me feels that its the job itself that is my main stressor  I feel outcasted from my colleagues and the stress of working in a hospital with all the noises  smells and people just throws me into overstimulation. 

Basically I don’t know if I should stick it out as I have a career opportunity lined up next year with my employer to become a registered practitioner however  due to my sick leave I feel this might have effected them pursuing this. I wanted to do this career when I was in university but now Ive been in this field for 2 years I’m wondering if it is right for me. I cant handle the office politics and the fake niceties  I like working independently and knowing what situation I’m going into which in healthcare is non-existent. 

I feel really guilty for taking this time off and I am lucky to have the option to think about this but I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place on whether to find something different or continue down this road. 

I get only I can know whats right for me but wanted to know if anyone else has been in a similar situation who can offer their two cents. ",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ftkkb2/feel_like_a_burden/

For 29 years I am still at this misery  I struggle to interact with people  I somehow can't keep a conversation because my mind just float somewhere  everytime I have one and then it makes me anxious that I wouldn't be able to talk back as I was occupied with other things 

I think I tried what I could do with it to change  books and applying it  but still it just keeps getting harder and harder. I know I need to adjust my expectations now  but its making me feel why-cant-i-just-do-it  I know what I need to do but still its hard. 

I feel so worthless that I can't even earn now  that I have no job because of this  everytime I have to face someone  I would go into flight or freeze  what have I'd been doing all these years...

Also  my family/parents does not believe we have something in our gens that needs a doctor for our mental health  they think it is so shameful to be known by others to be check mentally  so I have never been to a doctor. well  I am physically fine all these years  but mentally i-dont-know-anymore.

I feel so bad to my potentials and opportunities that I let go  because I can't function well when I am facing anyone. Now I feel hopeless  and felt I wasted a lot of my time  trying to fix this all on my own. I missed the chance while I was young to properly address the problem  now I can't do it as I have no money and can't ask them to afford it for me.

Regrets ... How can I be at this world now  I don't know now where I belong...

I am exhausted trying to tame this feeling whole day  as I don't wanna freak out and call someone close to me  just to tell how messy this is now. I just keep saying whole day  I will feel it and I don't need to act on it.... But I am at my limit now  I am tired  but unable to sleep... I am even anxious what will be my tomorrow... I don't know how to face it anymore... ",4,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1d9htg3/i_feel_so_worthlessuseless/
Anxiety,School anxiety and feeling worthless. HELP,"I’ve always been an anxious student. I’m very type A personality and a perfectionist. My biggest shame is that I dropped out of nursing school in third year. COVID hit in first year and on top of that I had very severe depression and anxiety leading to psychogenic seizures.

It’s been a couple of years now and I want to try nursing again at a college (I’ll be moving provinces)  and suffice it to say I am VERY nervous. I want to do well and I just don’t know how to battle my anxiety. I want this time around to go well. Any tips on combating school anxiety?

Anxiety,Working stresses me out and being unemployed also stresses me out and makes me feel worthless and depressed. Is it just me?," I  22 (F) can never keep a job due to anxiety and my mental health condition but being unemployed also makes me feel worthless and depressed.

Right now I've just quit my most recent job due to my mental health and it hasn't even been a month since I quit and I am already feeling worthless and depressed due not having a job. It got to a point where I just don't even know what I should do and I feel like there is no way out for me. I don't think I will ever be able to keep a job due to anxiety and my mental health condition but not working makes me feel incapable  worthless and a failure.

Especially seeing people I went to school with being able to work and doing well and being able to keep their jobs makes me feel like a total failure.

It feels like a vicious cycle that never ends: being employed is hard due to my mental health and being unemployed makes me feel worthless and depressed.

I just feel pathetic and hopeless. I was starting to do better for a few days  but everything's come crashing back down on me again.

I just need someone  anyone  to tell me I'm enough  even if it's a lie.

My anxiety has been running circles around me  and I'm so afraid of negatively impacting the people in my life that I don't feel comfortable enjoying anything because I'm already causing problems for everyone I know  kind of just by existing.

Moreover  I'm terrified of being abandoned if I slip up or don't do enough for people. My anxiety keeps me questioning if the people who love me actually love me.

I wish I could just get angry. Anger is so much easier for me to deal with than fear. Fear is all consuming. Incapacitating.

I desperately need some comfort  but everyone in my life is going through their own shit and the last thing I want is to make their lives harder. I spend so much time trying to think of ways to make their lives better  but at the end of the day  I just feel powerless.

BPD,I'm really lost & struggling after my son's suicide.,"I have BPD & I strongly suspect my 16 year old son did as well. We are/were both AudHD as well. He had a huge amount of trauma from public school. I wasn't diagnosed until 2022 & recognized many of his struggles as things I also struggled with at that age. So I had him evaluated last spring & he was then diagnosed. He was put on a wait list for therapy right away  but couldn't get an appointment until last October. He experienced his first love & then first breakup last September. She moved on immediately with someone he thought was a friend. They all had a huge blow out. Her new bf ended up posting some very personal details about my son (that the ex girlfriend told him) on a huge snapchat group chat. My son was receiving threats and messages from people telling him to kill himself daily for almost 2 months before we found out. He showed me some of the messages & it was horrible & non-stop. He was finally able to start therapy & showed some improvement  though he was diagnosed with depression & anxiety as well. He started meds for that in November. We got restraining orders on a pair of brothers that were exceptionally horrible & consistent with the harassment. They eventually threatened our whole family. They would torment my son online  but never show up to ""handle things"" when they said they would  but they kept tabs on him enough to be menacing (before the RO). After the ro's  things calmed down. My son was then referred to online intensive outpatient. He started that in March & finished May 31st. The whole month of May we all saw a change in him for the worse  but he would never open up. He would never open up in therapy either  group or individual. He would sometimes open up to me when things were really bad. On June 1st he was out with some friends & came home on time but he was acting off  but wouldn't say anything. Then the morning of June 2nd he admitted he hit a huge pothole the night before in his car & that the front driver's side tire wouldn't turn. We looked at it  figured out it was a fairly easy/cheap fix. I drove him to work that day & then picked him up when he was done. We got home & he changed out of work clothes. Around 9:45 he went outside & we assumed he was going to work on his car. After an hour I started getting concerned. My husband didn't see him in his car but our garage light was on & thought maybe our son was in there looking for tools. So he went out to see he could help  but instead found our son hanging from the rafters. We called 911 & paramedics worked on him for 45 minutes  but he was gone. He didn't leave a note  he didn't say goodbye  nothing. To make matters worse  we found out his bullies in this group chat were laughing that he was dead. Our whole family is just lost & devastated. We love & miss him so much. We tried whatever was recommended to help him & we feel like we failed because we couldn't save him. Obviously emotional regulation is difficult with BPD & I'm currently losing my shit. I'm so lost  heartbroken  & devastated. But mostly I feel rage  rage at these people that bullied him so badly he just completely shut down & lost any hope. Has anyone else experienced this kind of horrible tragedy?? Thankfully  no one else I know has ever lost a child. I'm just trying to find ways that have worked for other people with BPD when under this kind of extreme emotional turmoil.

I know it's not good. and even if I don't feel loved sometimes  I hang on to dear life to this voice that's the voice of reason that tells me that it's an episode and I can't lash out. and I feel like maybe I can keep going for now  but one day I won't be able to.

BPD,BPD is like fire and water: one second it’s an overwhelming  “I HATE YOU ” & another second is flood of tears  crying “I’m sorry  I need you ”,"BPD is when you have a love-hate relationship with the people closest to you; the world; & yourself.

BPD is when people walk on eggshells around you because they don’t want to trigger you  but at the same time you walk on eggshells because - you’re afraid of them leaving you.

BPD is when you struggle to regulate your emotions and need/want so badly to tell someone  your favourite person  your love-hate parent  or Reddit  because you just want so badly for someone to understand and calm you down - 

But BPD is also when your therapist tells you  “Your dependency on others and inability to regulate your emotions is unhealthy. You need to self-soothe. Be able to be your own person. Individuate. Stop depending on others. Emotionally. Financially.”

Yet deep within you  you stare at your therapists & the world and think  “But do you really understand what I’m going through?! Do you really think I don’t want to be normal  like you?”

It’s when your therapist tells you  “I don’t know how to help you anymore ” & then you tell them “But please  this is what I was afraid of ” & then their response goes  “It’s okay I’m still going to look after you ” 

-
It’s the reality when people tell you  “You just need to find your purpose. Find your sense of self.” - Yet you wrestle because you’re always lost  you’re always searching - 

You’re searching for belonging. Stability. Acceptance. Normalcy. Love. Self-love. Confidence. Friends. For people to stay.

You do want to know who you are;
You do want to figure your purpose in life;
You want to be happy.
- 

You just want so badly to be free from the 5-9 symptoms - 

You don’t want to feel all these anger; then sadness; then a glimpse of hope; then back to  “Life is too hard  it’s too painful  I can’t deal ”

It’s when you feel like you’re a burden to the people around you;
You want them so badly to understand you; to understand this dumb mental illness  

But will they ever?

You want to be completely free of this chokehold of a “disorder” 

You want the DBT skills to work  but it’s hard to remember the skills when your distress level is mf high; & then when you’re depressed  does it look like I wanna practise them skills? 
-


& maybe someday you will: You will have wins. You will no longer fit the traits for BPD/your mental disorder. You will have developed sufficient skills to tolerate distress; communicate effectively; practise mindfulness & regulate emotions. You will be free.

Free from bad memories. Healed from past trauma. Less emotional pain.. Successfully built a life worth living..

But today is not the day for me  (and you?)
Yes I hate myself 
Yes I’m black & white 
Yes I’m always afraid people are gonna leave me 
I battle suicidal ideations 
I fight urges to not hurt myself 
I am constantly lost about who I am 
I get triggered easily and feel everything intensely;

&
maybe that’s okay :’)
At least for today.

For tomorrow I’ll wake & fight all over again.
But if I lose  if I relapse  if I slide  if I attempt.. at least I’m trying not to sink further in the deep ocean  of which everyone w/o BPD/mental illness seem to be swimming fine  aite? :’)

BPD,Found out a friend has BPD aswell and i'm really overwhelmed??,"A few months ago  i met this one person online  and as i recently found out  both of us have BPD.

Our friendship has always been inconsistent.

Like  one day we'd talk a bunch  and then it'd be radio-silence from their end for hours  to days  to weeks.

Personally  getting ghosted/ignored leads me to overthink REALLY quickly  so a few days ago i asked them if there's a reason as to why they ignore me.

Following this  they were very open about them having BPD. They explained the disorder to me  and  im guessing  they simply don't want to hurt me when they're going through something.

As they told me  i felt something really intense  really painful. I think it's the need to want to connect with them over our problems.

Not too long after  i also told them about me having BPD aswell  but this hasn't necessarily made anything better.

We did agree that it's nice to know someone else with BPD personally  but nothing good has really happened since.

What DID happen however is that shortly after the talk we had  they likely got hit with another episode(They've been increasingly distant and unresponsive again and even from afar i can tell they're not doing good.).

This obviously stinks for them but also for me  as i'm already someone that has a tendency of making other peoples problems mine aswell. But ontop of that  like i mentioned  i really wanna connect about our experiences too.

So now  while i'm being ignored once again and they're likely spiraling  i'm hit with my trigger of being ignored and with the guilt of not being able to help them and comfort them.

I know that the best thing i really can do right now is just wait it out  but then again i can never be sure.

We haven't actually talked about our triggers or boundaries yet  so it's REALLY hard to know if i should maybe just send them a message saying i'm here for them or leave it be.

I'm really overwhelmed by this situation and i've been stressing about it so much that i haven't been able to concentrate on actual life stuff and it's also really hard to distract myself.

This is more of a rant  but i'm open to advice.",0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1jtljfq/found_out_a_friend_has_bpd_aswell_and_im_really/

BPD,Built a Tool to Help Manage Overwhelming Decisions,"Hi everyone   
I know that for many people dealing with BPD  making decisions can feel incredibly overwhelming—each choice might trigger intense emotions and self-doubt. I’ve struggled with this myself  and over time I developed a tool designed to break down decisions into manageable steps. It helps clarify what’s most important  weighs pros and cons  and even pulls in external insights to provide some guidance.

I built it as a personal project to make decision-making feel a little less chaotic  and I’m curious if others find it helpful too. Whether you’re making daily choices or facing bigger decisions  I’d really appreciate any feedback on whether a structured approach like this might ease the process.

I’ve attached a short [demo](https://youtu.be/Lm4MxcyQ6OY)—curious to hear from fellow overthinkers. Would this help refine your decision process? I was also thinking that if this [waitlist](https://waitlister.me/p/clearli) gets enough interest  I could finish the app and release it to the entire community!

Would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions!",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1jma8xz/built_a_tool_to_help_manage_overwhelming_decisions/
BPD,Those who have spending addictions as a result of BPD; What has helped you?,"I have a penny spending addiction. I think it inherently stems from wanting both a sense of control over my life  and also wanting to feel like I'm 'doing okay'  even when we really aren't. I grew up with my family constantly telling me how much they struggled to support us (demeaningly more often than not) despite being able to buy a home  buy all new appliances  have a fully stocked fridge  etc. 

My fiancee and I both  for the most part  share money. He's been out of work since November  I've been managing the budget on a spreadsheet since probably June if I had to guess. We always meet our bills  I always make sure of that; but I always spend so much it either stresses him out or more often than not  leaves nothing for him. Including his own money.

As of current we had to reach out for rental assistance help  and they came through  leaving us in the excess about $130. I *promised him* I wouldn't spend it all; and I haven't  but we've got about $56 left.

I had to pick up medicine for my cat  I did have to buy us a pan (we only have a pot currently)  and I did have to pull out $20 for our laundry; but I also bought q-tips  lens cleaning wipes  2 sodas for $1.30 each  a 2 pack of ice trays for $3  a clearance blanket for the cats for $5 (we have almost no furniture currently) and an ice bucket for $3. None of those last things were necessary!!!!! Not one!!!!! And I still saw the low price tag and how much was in the account and I was like ""yeah this is fine  we've talked about getting the ice trays  he wanted me to pick up a pan  q-tips aren't that much...."" And I fucking SPENT MONEY I SHOULDN'T HAVE. Money that could have gone to quite literally his only coping skill and my only freelancing skill; which is internet.

I do plan on bringing this up to my DBT therapist next meeting  it'll be the first time I'll be admitting to a therapist I have a spending problem.

For those of you who struggle with spending problems; what helped you? Coping skills  strategies  etc. For those in a relationship where someone has spending problems; how do you navigate paying bills and budgeting for them? A joint account for bills is unfortunately not an option as I'm on state insurance and they would consider his income into that account as my income as well.

BPD,How do I speak to/help my manic/addicted aunt? Is there a way to get through to her?,"I wasn't sure where else to ask for help so here it goes.

My mothers sister has been struggling with suspected bipolar/manic and likely addiction for about 10 years now. This story has so much more history behind it but to keep it brief I am only going to try and touch on the important details.

Essentially this all started with some kind of mental break about 10 years ago. This involved paranoia  complete disassociation and panic (running naked through the neighborhood). I was 12 when this happened so these are mostly my own recollections from this time and I am not trying to shame or humiliate her  just state the facts as I know them. From here its been a constant battle to figure out what is wrong. At first the doctors said it was seizures caused by untreated rheumatic fever  but none of the treatments worked to stop the seizures. She developed tremors and they then said she must have had a stroke. She went through a bunch of treatments for this to no avail  she was still shaking  having seizures and having manic episodes where she would lash out and do and say horrible things to her family. We started to suspect alcohol issues after multiple family members caught her drinking multiple bottles of wine late at night. She also has a doctor family friend who has been willing to prescribe her anything she wants and it was revealed that she has been taking oxycodone and other pain meds for every thing for a while. She claims to have so many aches and pains that are unbearable. At this point her husband separated from her (about 5 years after the initial incident) and her relationship with my cousins and family became very strained. Her husband bought her a house and within a week she claimed she was raped by a repair man that came to that house and started to have terrors about men and being alone. It was at this point we also found out that she has had sleeping problems for years  going without sleep for days and days at a time  but had also been taking ambien for this issue and would sometimes be sleeping through the day.

The point of this  is there is really no indication of what is the truth anymore. She doesn't sleep and when this happen she has manic episodes and cannot be instructed on what to do. She has had many inpatient stays at many different facilities but is always released only vaguely better and there is always another episode. She has seen neurologists  psych evals of all kinds and no one can pin down what is going on.

She is having another episode this week and my mom being the oldest most established and stable sister takes the brunt of it but I can tell she is getting so tired. My aunt makes up stories that blatantly didn't happen  will say one thing and then get mad the next because she can't remember saying it  etc. The issue right now is she is on Klonopin and a number of other anti anxiety and sleep meds and also broke her foot a month ago (somehow  she doesn't remember how but she was ""definitely not drinking"" when it happened)  and has been given pain meds for it along with medical marijuana for the chronic pains that aren't related. We believe she hasn't slept (her story keeps changing). We tried to find an inpatient place to take her to but nowhere has beds right now and getting her there would be a fight anyways. We did a zoom call with her Psychiatrist and he said she needs to NOT take the Klonopin with the pain meds and the marijuana is also probably making things worse but she can't/wont understand and just keeps ranting about how we want her in pain. My mom has already stayed with her a ton over the last 10 years  the other siblings are out of state or also can't help and her husband has completely given up on her as well and just doesn't want to be involved and honestly involving him makes things worse anyways  he has his own BS.

The point is  help. I hate seeing my aunt go through this and my mom can't handle any more of it and I'm just the 23 year old niece but there isn't much I can do  she wouldn't respond well to me and I kind of need to stay out of it for my cousins sake. If I get too involved it will upset the family balance and I am kind of the only tie her kids and husband have to our family right now (they hate all of my other aunts including my mom because again  my aunt can't keep a story straight and tells lies about everyone) so everyone is pissed at everyone else. What can I do? What is left to do? What is the correct way to deal with someone who is so manic?",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/xnwft8/how_do_i_speak_tohelp_my_manicaddicted_aunt_is/

BPD,has anyone else done really horrible things ,"(before i begin- i’m not attempting to say bpd automatically makes someone abusive or make poor choices as that’s untrue and there is enough stigma around the disorder  disorders don’t make you abuse someone just there are abusers without any kind of disorder  i just feel like we should all be able to acknowledge that untreated severe mental illness in general  but especially personality disorders  can unfortunately result in really poor behavior)

i have done some really horrific shit  specifically when my bpd was untreated and i was in active addiction. i won’t specify what i did  i didn’t kill or rape anyone to say the least  but it’s still bad shit. although i’m not that person anymore  the fact that i ever was haunts me every single day of my life  and i can’t help but wonder what i would’ve and could’ve been like if i didn’t have bpd. i carry around so much guilt  shame  regret  and self hatred and it doesn’t help that i’ve given myself a bad reputation based on past behavior. does anyone else have a really messy/shitty/shameful past that was influenced by their untreated bpd? also disclaimer- i’m fully aware that my actions are no one’s and nothing’s fault but my own and bpd is not a hall pass to behave in abusive  toxic  or unhealthy ways - i have made all of the appropriate changes to my behavior and will continue to when necessary.

BPD,BPD isn’t inherently worse than other mental health disorders,"I know BPD is considered to be the most painful mental health disorder and the statistics show that suicide is more common for pwBPD. I’m not at all denying that BPD is a completely debilitating and painful condition. I feel like my world is crashing in every day and I can barely function!

I guess my frustration is that I keeping seeing people online use BPD as a “my struggle is more than someone with MDD  GAD  BiPD  OCD  etc”. That’s kind of just a symptom of the internet  but it’s such a silly generalization. 

People end their lives over MDD. People with MDD are on disability because they can’t keep a job. They can be in and out of inpatient care. They can have addictions and self harm. There is so much individual variation in how people experience their mental health that you can’t say “I knew I had BPD because I had such severe SH and I was admitted so many times as a child”. Some people with BPD have never been admitted. 

My sister has OCD and she was admitted for months of her childhood  had to switch between specialized behavioral schools 3 times  can’t drive  is on disability  and we are pursuing getting her in a facility where she can have professionals care for her around the clock. Some people with OCD are completely independent in adulthood. A lot of people with BPD  including myself  are way more independent than my sister. That’s not to say I am not at a greater risk for intentional suicide (she is unintentionally a danger to herself and others)  but our experiences are so different that it’s not remotely feasible nor helpful to compare severity. 

There’s no competition if we are all struggling in our own minds. I wish I would stop seeing people say “just” depression or “just” anxiety. Those things have such a spectrum of severity. It feels like the diagnoses have become so common that people forget how severe they can present. It seems everyone had depression/anxiety and while I don’t know what’s going on in everyone’s private life  the majority of people who talk about mental illness don’t seem to be representative of how bad things can get. 

I have a family member who has anxiety about sharing a bathroom and can only relieve themself in jars. That is not romanticized the way being nervous about asking for no pickle is. 

TLDR: Yay for anxiety/depression having less stigma  but let’s not forget that all mental health conditions are some presentation of anxiety and/or depression and all mental health conditions exist with spectrums of symptom severity.

BPD,1 gram of shrooms helped me realize that I have a caffeine addiction which negatively impacts my BPD symptoms,"Caffeine definitely is not the cause of my BPD symptoms  but a shroom trip with just 1 gram helped me realize that I do have a caffeine addiction which negatively impacts my life. I think I have been denying it  saying to my self that - it's just caffeine  it's not like I do drugs. Shrooms helped me accept that brain biochemistry doesn't care about the legal status of caffeine. I had to accept that even though being completely legal and sold everywhere  I do get mood crashes from caffeine as I would from cocaine (which I tried about 12 years ago). I can have a few cups of tea in a day  but I do like to drink several in a row  I also like coffee and yerba mate. I have been observing my symptoms for a while and I do notice that I get dysphoric later on in the day if I have coffee or yerba mate in the morning  especially on an empty stomach. I also get more paranoid about being alone  not having any friends (even though I do have several good friends)  etc. I knew this for a while  just shrooms helped me accept that I really should do something about the caffeine addiction as it really negatively impacts my mood and sense of self.   
I don't think I need to completely give up tea  but I did have to quit coffee and yerba mate  which actually did help me to have a more even mood throughout the day.

BPD,Help: dealing with concurrent ED  addiction and BPD?,"Please bear with me as this is kind of a long ass post:

CW: eating disorder (anorexia)  addiction (no specifics).

Two weeks ago I got out of rehab for the treatment of my addiction. While there  I was diagnosed with BPD which came as a huge relief because I've always felt my ED and addiction were symptoms of something  and now it is obvious that something is (quiet) BPD. In rehab  I was receiving ED support for anorexia (which I've struggled with since the age of 6)  but since I've returned home my ED's spiralled even further. The thing is  I was actually supposed to go to ED treatment instead of rehab but things got complicated when treatment refused me due to the severity of my addiction issues  and then rehab originally refused then eventually agreed to take me under strict conditions because they deemed my ED too acute for their facility. In the end  I attended/completed rehab with ED support and once I got out I actually had some high hopes for my recovery. However  things aren't going as planned and although I really did intend on following my meal plan  things are really spiralling and I'm feeling super alone and vulnerable. Rationally  I know my weight is pretty low and everyone keeps commenting nervously about how thin I am  but body dysmorphia's being a major bitch and won't let me see the severity of the situation.

I guess my biggest struggle right now is staying sober/clean while trying to manage an acute ED  and I guess this is where I'm looking for support. Before I left rehab  it was agreed with my care team there that to maintain my sobriety  I'll have to maintain my weight because any gains would send me straight back into my addiction. This sounded like a good idea at the time  but now I'm realizing what a slippery slope this actually is. I've already had a few slips addiction-wise since I got home and I can feel myself brooding  my impulsive/self-damaging BPD behaviours creeping in and I'm feeling increasingly more empty and restless. On top of that  this weekend was Canadian thanksgiving and as I'm sure you know how hellish holidays can be for those of us with EDs. In saying this  my ED's kicked into an even higher gear due to the time of year and I'm starting to lose sight of my recovery altogether.

All in all  I guess I came here looking for some support for juggling mutliple recoveries all at once. Concurrent disorders are hell and I feel like whenever I make progress in one recovery  symptom shifting occurs with another. I'm being pressured to go to ED treatment if I can maintain my sobriety for 3-4 months  and I know treatment is the only hope I have for ED recovery but honestly after the hell they put me through these past few months  I don't really want to commit to their program. I'm also starting to feel like I'll never be able to recover from anorexia because my moods/behaviours are When I went to rehab  I expected to come out with zero addiction (substance and behavioural) symptoms  but now that I'm out I couldn't have been more wrong.

And I feel like if I never have those things my life is worthless I’m in my late 20s so I feel so much pressure in general but with my BPD I feel so not worth anything without a man.

BPD,Anyone feel the existential loneliness from having such intense emotions that rarely anyone can relate to.,Whenever I feel sadness or any negative emotion  the problem isn’t how intensely I feel it. The problem is feeling like there’s no one that will be able to relate to the depth of that emotion with me. I’ve rarely met people that can actually understand my pain. And that adds a loneliness factor to my emotional experiences. Does anyone else feel this way as well? Please share your experiences so that I don’t feel so alone 😔,105,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1jfb54n/anyone_feel_the_existential_loneliness_from/

BPD,emptiness and loneliness.,"i feel so crushingly lonely. i feel no satisfaction in any of my relationships at all. i guess i love my friends.. i hope. but i'm constantly craving a whole new life with new friends  new hobbies  new interests  new everything. 

it's especially been hard after losing my fp officially and feeling my sense of self plummet because so much of my identity stemmed from him and the friendship we once had. i feel so empty  so lost and scared. i just need someone to wake me up again. i can't do it alone. i can't do anything alone. 

everyone tells me i need to leave the house more  get a job  etc.. but i have absolutely no direction in life whatsoever. i can't do anything but rot indoors and numb myself out with entertainment and music. i want a life  but i'm afraid that it'll never be enough. will i always be this empty? will i mess everything up even more?

BPD,Constantly craving connection and experiencing deep loneliness ,"Even after understanding and accepting my (30f) BPD I still find myself dwelling on that ache within my heart  that feeling of loneliness that never goes away. 


My childhood trauma and not having any family members that truly care for me breaks my heart if I let myself think about it for too long. Therapy has been so draining  constantly bringing up repressed memories and realizing more and more why I am the way I am… 


I know this is probably a universal feeling  not just with BPD  but I feel absolutely heart broken if I think too much about how badly I wish I had any sort of stable parental figure in my life to care for me and be there for me when things get tough.. Just someone to listen and care about me.. That concept seems so foreign and I find myself hyper-fixating on it SO much since beginning therapy.. 

While watching old Laguna Beach reruns as a comfort show recently all of the Graduation and Prom episodes have been making me cry my eyes out because I genuinely feel jealous. Seeing their parents be there for big moments and be genuinely excited to celebrate them and their lives makes me wish that I could have experienced life like that so badly. 

I wish I had a normal mom and dad to just hug me and be there to tell me things will “be okay”…

BPD,I'm really lost & struggling after my son's suicide.,"I have BPD & I strongly suspect my 16 year old son did as well. We are/were both AudHD as well. He had a huge amount of trauma from public school. I wasn't diagnosed until 2022 & recognized many of his struggles as things I also struggled with at that age. So I had him evaluated last spring & he was then diagnosed. He was put on a wait list for therapy right away  but couldn't get an appointment until last October. He experienced his first love & then first breakup last September. She moved on immediately with someone he thought was a friend. They all had a huge blow out. Her new bf ended up posting some very personal details about my son (that the ex girlfriend told him) on a huge snapchat group chat. My son was receiving threats and messages from people telling him to kill himself daily for almost 2 months before we found out. He showed me some of the messages & it was horrible & non-stop. He was finally able to start therapy & showed some improvement  though he was diagnosed with depression & anxiety as well. He started meds for that in November. We got restraining orders on a pair of brothers that were exceptionally horrible & consistent with the harassment. They eventually threatened our whole family. They would torment my son online  but never show up to ""handle things"" when they said they would  but they kept tabs on him enough to be menacing (before the RO). After the ro's  things calmed down. My son was then referred to online intensive outpatient. He started that in March & finished May 31st. The whole month of May we all saw a change in him for the worse  but he would never open up. He would never open up in therapy either  group or individual. He would sometimes open up to me when things were really bad. On June 1st he was out with some friends & came home on time but he was acting off  but wouldn't say anything. Then the morning of June 2nd he admitted he hit a huge pothole the night before in his car & that the front driver's side tire wouldn't turn. We looked at it  figured out it was a fairly easy/cheap fix. I drove him to work that day & then picked him up when he was done. We got home & he changed out of work clothes. Around 9:45 he went outside & we assumed he was going to work on his car. After an hour I started getting concerned. My husband didn't see him in his car but our garage light was on & thought maybe our son was in there looking for tools. So he went out to see he could help  but instead found our son hanging from the rafters. We called 911 & paramedics worked on him for 45 minutes  but he was gone. He didn't leave a note  he didn't say goodbye  nothing. To make matters worse  we found out his bullies in this group chat were laughing that he was dead. Our whole family is just lost & devastated. We love & miss him so much. We tried whatever was recommended to help him & we feel like we failed because we couldn't save him. Obviously emotional regulation is difficult with BPD & I'm currently losing my shit. I'm so lost  heartbroken  & devastated. But mostly I feel rage  rage at these people that bullied him so badly he just completely shut down & lost any hope. Has anyone else experienced this kind of horrible tragedy?? Thankfully  no one else I know has ever lost a child. I'm just trying to find ways that have worked for other people with BPD when under this kind of extreme emotional turmoil.

BPD,Seeing my neurotypical coworkers makes me want to kill myself.,"I see them laughing and talking to each other so easily. They seem so drawn to each other's presence and literally light up. Meanwhile  I'm treated like a pitiful child they gotta smile at to be ""polite"".

It's been like this my entire life. I always felt ""different"" than others and never knew why. I felt like an alien  like my \*existence\* was so disgusting and pitiful. Like they wished I didn't exist so they didn't have to fake-smile at me. I can see the difference in the way people treat me. And it's not that I'm entirely crazy; others have said they've noticed I get entirely ignored by my peers.

The types of people I get along with well are those also suffering from some type of mental health condition like me. Unfortunately  in my field of work those people are rare. Instead  I am surrounded by charming  competitive  and attractive folks all the time  and their existence suffocates me. And  I am forced to interact with them in the work place where they judge me constantly.

I've always felt that people were harsh to me all the time  they judged me  they were condescending. I am so incredibly sensitive to people's every word and tone that it cripples me. And  I get blamed for being so ""sensitive"" like I can't just toughen up and realize that ""they're good people  you're just crazy"". Then why do they hurt me so much??

I don't understand why I'm not ""normal"". Why I couldn't have a simpler life where I am casually considering suicide at every moment  and anything on this planet affects me emotionally. Why couldn't I just be stable and not a fucking lunatic about to cave at any moment.

BPD,Advice to Young People With BPD,"I (26M) have been in treatment for my mental health for 10 years and was diagnosed with BPD 5 years ago. It has been a painful road to get to where I am  but I no longer meet the criteria for BPD and haven't for 2 years. 

Lately  I’ve been reflecting on what I’ve learned through all of this. I think some of it might be helpful for anyone who’s just been diagnosed or is starting treatment. A few of these points may come off as blunt or harsh—but I’d rather be honest and direct than sugar-coat things. That’s what I needed when I was starting out  and maybe someone else does too.

1. **The worst thing you can do is over-identify with this diagnosis**. This is not a disease like cancer or the flu. There is no blood test or scan or universal biomarker. BPD is a cluster of observed behaviors and emotional responses that meet a threshold set by diagnostic criteria. It is better to view this diagnosis as a framework to address your problems rather than a fixed biological fact. When you start seeing *everything* through the lens of BPD—your moods  your actions  your relationships—you trap yourself. Saying “I did this because of my BPD” doesn’t make it okay. It might explain it  but it doesn’t excuse it. And if you keep leaning on the diagnosis like a crutch  you’ll never learn to walk without it.
2. **Things improve over time  but you get to decide the cost**. There are two paths forward  and you're going to learn either way. 
   1. You get into treatment--therapy  DBT  self-reflection  whatever works--and actually do the work. It's hard. It's uncomfortable. But it's growth. You learn to sit with your emotions  take responsibility  and break the patterns that keep wrecking your life.
   2. You don't do the work. You keep spiraling. You keep lashing out. You learn through pain--losing people who loved you  burning bridges you can't rebuild  and missing out on opportunities you may never get again. You'll still improve over time  but you'll carry more scars.
3. **Self-awareness is paramount**. You have to be brutally honest with yourself about your behavior. That means no lying to yourself about why you did something. No sugar-coating  no justifying. Yes  it is uncomfortable to admit you did something out of desperation for attention  a need for control  or fear of being abandoned. But if you don't recognize why you did it you'll do it again. Break the cycle now  while you still can. The longer you avoid the truth  the more damage you do—and the more shame you’ll have to climb out of later.
4. **Be careful with who you let in**. There's a cost to being fully seen when you're struggling--especially if it happens often or over a long period of time. The hard truth is that people don't always forget what they saw. You might move on  you might grow--but to them  you're still the person who broke down  spiraled  lost control. The more someone sees you as unstable  the harder it becomes for them to see you as strong  reliable  or capable. The perception can stick--even after you've done the work to change. This doesn't mean you need to hide everything or fake being okay. It *does* mean that you should be intentional about who you confide in. Not everyone deserves a front-row seat to your struggles. Protect your dignity. Protect your future relationships. You can be honest without being exposed.
5. **Don't give up**. This will not be easy. It's really fucking hard and no one else will understand unless they've been through it themselves. Life is chaotic especially when you're young. You're going to fuck up  say and do things you'll regret. You'll lose people. **But this isn’t something only people with BPD go through**. This is life. It’s messy  painful  and unpredictable—for everyone. There is a light at the end of the tunnel  but no one's going to drag you to it. You have to walk there yourself  but that's what makes it beautiful.",559,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1jhrxzm/advice_to_young_people_with_bpd/
BPD,I'm 36. Tell me it gets better,"Because I feel much the same as I did when I was 16.

Can't hold down a job. And I'm 36. What am I supposed to do? People my age have established careers and savings and I'm googling jobs that don't require a driver's license because I keep having panic attacks when I go to get it renewed. 

I'm raising two children the best I can. I have no energy for anything else. I cannot maintain relationships.

BPD,Please tell me I made the right choice having an abortion and that I could never have handled or given my baby everything because of my BPD,"I have diagnosed BPD and ADD  my ex has bipolar and ADD (diagnosed as well).

I always without fail took the pill  but my ex never used protection so we just got very very unlucky falling pregnant.

He instantly lost his shit. Fell into depression. Started ignoring me. Telling me he can't have this baby.

I never wanted kids because of my childhood trauma but once I found out I was pregnant I guess hormones kicked in and I loved the baby. I saw it on ultrasounds and it was measuring perfect. For once I took proper care of my body and health. For my baby. All my actions pointed to me wanting to keep it.

However with my ex desperate for an abortion and the moral window closing soon (if I got an abortion I'd want it before 8 weeks - no nervous system on brain activity yet  so it would not feel or be aware of anything) things were getting super tense.

My ex threatened suicide. He said he would leave me and never want to see our child. He already abandoned another child (that he told me his ex kept from him  but during my pregnancy admitted to never wanting)  so I knew he was capable of that.

When his bipolar gets bad he's usually off the rails getting into debt and bouts on unemployment  so I knew financially he'd contribute next to nothing. (he pays his ex 100/150 a month)

I asked my family if they would support me (let me live there for the first few months with baby) and they basically said no. Then I thought about it and hated myself for wanting to bring my baby into the lives of the people who traumatised me.

But I had no one else. I struggle with codependency like my mom so I was unhealthily attached to my ex and had no support system whatsoever.

I got a lot of counselling from unwanted/unplanned pregnancy therapists but it always came down to its up to you  if you want it  keep it.

I wanted to keep it so badly but how could I  faced with reality:

- I have BPD. I'm easily overstimulated and completely shut down when I am. Frequently fall into depression and suicidal ideation where I'm unable to function for days. I can barely take care of myself. I don't have life skills  I cannot teach a child how to regulate themselves. I'd resent them depending on me probably.

- I'm codependent and would probably repeat the same dynamics with my child that my mother did with me. Enmeshment. Emotional dependence. Traumatising my child for life even though I'd love it with all my heart.

- my ex has severe mental illness and ADD like me (what is the genetic element in this? Would our baby be more likely to suffer from mental illness/disability as well)

- no support system whatsoever.... Literally no one except my mentally ill parents. I'm not stable either. How am I going to show up for my child in the best way every single day? As much as I told myself I'd die for my child and do it all  that is wishful thinking and unrealistic and unfair.

- despite many moms doing it alone on purpose the thought of my child not having a dad  knowing that they were abandoned  and me not having a partner to support me  it felt wrong. Like every child deserves two loving parents.

- I'd have to get off my meds because they weren't pregnancy safe. I'm on an extremely high dose so without it who knows what would happen to me on different/no meds. 

I had the abortion because in my mind love was simply not enough.

Afterwards my ex cheated  threw me out and made me homeless  I was hospitalized for an od because I just couldn't handle living anymore.

My 'due date' is coming up and I am still so incredibly sad  grieving. People tell me the baby was 'nothing' yet. But it was everything to me. My whole heart. Something more than me. I feel so sorry. Guilty. Curious how it would have been. Wishing I could have been enough.

Just tell me I did the right thing for my baby and myself.",321,155,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1ctb4ib/please_tell_me_i_made_the_right_choice_having_an/
BPD,my bf told me he has to treat me like a 10 year old today ,"i was instantly triggered and i just walked out of his house and left  i was in thin pants and a hoodie and it was only 28 degrees. i walked 30 mins home . did i overreact? that was like a knife in my heart. i feel stupid . i feel unlovable . i cant control that many things trigger me . i cant control my emotions  and so he thinks im immature. maybe i am idk . 

edit:  i should have mentioned the context i was just so upset so didn’t think to . i left the room because we were arguing and i went to go sleep on the couch and he yelled at me to come back in the room and i said no so he grabbed me rlly hard and squeezed me and stuff and pulled me in his room and i said that he hurt me and he said “yeah because i have to treat you like youre fucking 10 years old” . lol…",256,81,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1hejskk/my_bf_told_me_he_has_to_treat_me_like_a_10_year/

BPD,Your feelings are valid but your behaviour is not,"I've been in remission since 2022  and one thing I have to constantly remind myself of is my emotions and feelings. The intensity is valid  but my behaviour is not in the past. Before going into treatment  I would just lash out and do shitty things due to the dysregulation. Not to say that that takes away the validity of it; it does not. But the point is  we all have to realise that we are experiencing bpd  the feelings of emptiness and dysregulation. That's valid  but our actions  on the other hand  are not. We have to take responsibility and accountability for our actions and not let our feelings guide us to do stupid hings. It's very hard to grasp for me when I was first told this  but as someone who has been in remission for close to 2 years now and while I'm far from being completely healed (because bpd can't be healed  just managed)  while I still experience symptoms of bpd  the difference right now is that I don't let my feelings guide me to do stupid things that I will regret later. Our feelings are valid  but our actions are not.

BPD,I HATE EVERY JOB I’VE EVER HAD & WORKING MAKES ME SUICIDAL😭,"I’ve been a receptionist  operations assistant & telephone interviewer then a personal assistant  executive assistant and communications lead. I seem to hate every single one of these!!! Ok I’ve sometimes enjoyed parts but I don’t like feeling trapped to strict hours or feeling obliged to join a stupid running or bake club at work to be a “team player” 

I’m now consider training to become a psychotherapist or a counsellor even though the jobs aren’t well paid at least I’m making a difference but I’m worried I’ll get sick of it or find it depressing. I’m so triggered by authority figures and HATE being told what to do and feel like work is so pointless. Just life feels meaningless and horrible. I am now an entertainment manager for three venues and feel like I sound dumb ass and I’m not good enough.

BPD,I'm a 32yo man-child  terrified to leave my parents' house. What would it take for me to change?,"I feel like a terrible person. I have no job  no relationship. I spend most of my days lying in the bed or watching videos. I do not contribute to the household. My parents are rich anyway  but that's not the point.

I have this fixed idea that I should be exceptional at something and have a career  or else my life is worthless. My friends are perfectionists too. I rarely meet them now  because I'm afraid to look them in the eye. I think I have the 'gifted child syndrome'. As my adult life began my BPD became more manifest and I got lost. It's as if I'd lost my own willpower and bravery to act and try to be as safe with as little effort as possible. Fast forward to 32 and I'm here with a worthless degree  doing menial jobs. I could've been so much more. I know I have it in me. My teachers loved me. My old friends don't understand how I don't have a PhD by now. 

I don't fully understand it myself. What I do understand is that as soon as I completely abandon the family safety net I will be forced to face the harsh realities of being this age with this little. That's probably why I don't want to move out.

Actually I often contemplate suicide. I think I'd rather have a clean death now than to have a meaningless and totally mediocre life and be a failure for the rest of my life.

I think what would have brought me change is lots of encouragement  training of my character and putting faith in me. I already had the emptiness in me when I was a teen  but back then it wasn't so noticeable  because all I had to do was study whatever was mandatory.

What do you guys think about my story? Is there a way still to live up to my potential?",62,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1hkpqfq/im_a_32yo_manchild_terrified_to_leave_my_parents/
BPD,Miserable and sad because BPD never is cured,"I’m very sad because BPD never really goes away. You just learn some tricks to not act on your feelings and ways to kind of ride it out. But BPD is not like a normal illness. It’s never cured. 

You will always have these feelings and these ways of experiencing the world. You’ll always have the pain. You won’t ever be normal like most people.

I’m in my 40s now. BPD ruined my life starting in my early 20s. I started getting treatment in my late 30s. My life is constant hell. I can barely keep things going. I just want to die.

The only thing that keeps me going is the idea of having children. My own life is meaningless.

BPD,It's too late. My daughter hates me.,"EDIT: Someone helped me gain some clarity tonight. It doesn't fix anything and my feelings won't go away  but I am not going to do anything. I am just going to sleep.

I have ruined my life. I had a BPD episode in front of my daughter. It hasn't happened in a long time and she has never it. She saw me self-harm and rage. I know that I wasn't violent towards her. It was all aimed at me. Punching myself over and over and over. It's been almost a year and I have panic attacks every day. I quit drinking 8 years ago and have started again. I will never see her again.

I am having a hard time not ending my shitty life. It seems like it is just a matter of time. I don't know what to do. I quit my job three days ago and will no longer be able to pay my bills. I have no friends anymore. I am lost and there is no coming back from this. I need to be saved and there is no one to save me.

My therapist has been trying DBT but I am unable to focus.  I would probably benefit if I wasn't in this hell. I don't want to do it if I will never see her again. I hate myself and can't wait to disappear. I am going to mail her a letter telling her that I have moved away for good and will never bother her again. I have already traumatized her and me ""moving away"" isn't going to help. If she knew what I was really going to do the guilt would destroy her. I need to make it seem like I am leaving her. Does it even matter? I won't have consciousness anyway  I won't exist. None of us will eventually so what does it matter? It is all meaningless.

I don't know why I am posting this. Maybe I am scared that I am really going to do this because I am weak. Part of me is happy it will all be over soon. I need to be brave. I have already mourned the loss of her like she died. It's worse though  she is alive and I have no way of fixing anything. I keep repeating ""do it"" over and over again in my head. I didn't mean to scare her yet now my life is over. I know you will all understand and won't judge me. Please don't tell me my life is worth living even without her. It's not and I can't do it anymore. Please just tell me it's not my fault and that I am not a bad person. Tell me I am not a monster.",27,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1gveyyp/its_too_late_my_daughter_hates_me/
BPD,How can I create a life that feels like it means something?,"Hello  I am looking to my fellow bpders for some advice. 

I have been diagnosed with BPD since the age of 19. I am now 21 years old and for the past year I have really cranked down on my personal growth. However  the last few months I have found myself loosing hope in my progress. 

To make an extremely long story short  I am in an extremely low and dark place at the moment. I am struggling with finding a meaning or a purpose in my life. Life is starting to feel very miserable and unbearable. I want to feel like I exist for a reason or that I’m capable of something. I feel like I don’t really have any talents like I’m not really good at anything. I don’t feel like there’s anything good or bad that stands out about me. I feel like I’m just a figure walking around in a meaningless body.

My relationship  does not feel fulfilling. I often feel unheard  not understood  and there just doesn’t seem to be a spark and I don’t know how to bring that back. 

My job is sucky  I am now working very part time at a job I used to work full time at due to being harassed several times by an aggressive client and needs being unmet by management. 

My life is very boring and I don’t feel fulfilled or anything I just feel bleak and like I’m in a repetitive  boring  lifeless cycle. 

How do I  someone with bpd find meaning in my life  is it even possible or am I on a hopeless journey? 

I do also have some other mental illnesses such as Major depressive disorder and others which may be why this feeling is so devastating strong.

BPD,how do i cope with my FP being my partner,"i've had a few fp's over the course of my life  but never have they been my romantic partner. that's changed very recently. 

i'm not sure what to do considering i feel so empty now when she doesn't respond to my texts (of which she never has before... this isn't new  she isnt a big texting person and i know that) i always end up questioning if she even loves me anymore or if she's upset with me. those concerns always dissipate when i see her and suddenly i feel so loved and happy. once we're apart  the cycle continues. it's exhausting to deal with the fact that this is now a thing everyday. i've also gotten close to total breakdowns several times over the smallest tone changes or other meaningless things. afterwards i feel like a total creep when i catch myself stalking her social media statuses or reposts... which only causes me to spiral even further :(

i feel like a huge bother bringing it up with her as i've only recently been diagnosed with BPD and we had a discussion about something like this fairly recently. i'm not sure what to do with myself.

another thing that's draining me is being so fucking jealous and irrationally jealous  for example: im jealous of my boyfriends cat. i know how crazy that sounds but bear with me. the thought of him loving an animal or object or anything more than me makes me sick  and she's a clingy anxiously attached kitten and he loves on her and coddles her like a baby so much and it upsets me when i KNOW it shouldn't  im incredibly jealous of my bestfrisnds two partners because they're poly and i feel put on the back burner because they're ALWAYS WITH THEM AND NEVER ME ANY MORE.

and im SO fucking tired of getting so fucking upset at everything to the point where it's physically fucking painful  ill feel everything all st once one hour and the next feel completely numb and empty then repeat. im so fucking tired of living like this.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1j1l4v9/im_so_fucking_tired_of_everything_so_much_to_be/

And each time is getting more complicated.Not only this pressure makes me feel trap but my life in here too  the weather in Canada  the lack of friends because I have moved around a lot  and specially the fact that I have been working in customer service for around 6 years now.Just because Is the field where more jobs are in here for us and the field that's makes easier the pr process.However  this is slowly killing me and I'm losing all my motivation in life.I don't even see a reason to stay in Canada  apart from my boyfriend  but also I don't wanna come back neither.I think  what makes me feel most miserable in my life is my job  and the fact that I don't think an immigrant has as many opportunities in the job market here  as the government made it seem.

BPD,I'm tired of everything I know,"I'm tired of my brain and interpreting the way my partner tries to comfort me as a sign that theyre tired. And I feel like they truly are. I don't know what will be the last straw. And they beg me not to leave and I don't want to leave but I feel like I have to. I feel like I should. I know I'm so sick I'm just going to make their life horrible. Whether they mean it or not when they say ""you're the best I've ever had"" I'm too sick to really believe that. Because they'll take it back. And I know its not the truth. I know there's  better for them out there and I hate the thought too. And here I am crying about a promise I knew would be broken. And I said I wasnt upset. I said I wasnt but I am. I feel horrible I even trusted a promise like that. And I was uneasy at first too. I said ""I know it's petty and small  and you don't have to  I'll probably just forget about it soon"" whatever whatever. And they insisted. and right the next say ""I'm sorry I couldnt keep my promise"" and I fucking knew I shouldn't have trusted that I knew I shouldn't have trusted ""I'll stop doing that  I promise I'm ok with it because it makes you unhappy"" and I get it I don't care anymore but I do and I dont want to care about anything anymore.

BPD,I'm tired of everything,"So  I'm feeling completely unloveable  and old and like nothing in my life is worth anything. I know this sounds like exaggerating  but that doesn't change the way I feel. I had a small relationship  which I simply seem not to be able to get over. It keeps coming back into my thoughts and it hurts that they don't really care about me anymore. And I can't tell them how much they hurt me  because obviously that would just make things worse  and I don't think they are trying to hurt me  they just don't care. Which just hurts too much. Especially since it feels like my life is over  there is nothing for me in the future.

I've read how people with BPD have found stable and good relationships and feel like that is impossible for me  especially anymore now that I'm close to 40. I feel like I'm too much and too little at the same time. I'm hurting  but I don't know how to describe that to people  so I can't even ask for help. I don't even know how to be social anymore.

I need to feel loved  and I need to feel like someone cares. I'm in a bad place and don't know how to move on. Please  I do need help  though I don't know what that would be.

But I do wish it did. To feel like whenever I need it. To feel like I am worth something whenever I need the reminder. To know that I will be missed if I am gone. I just need those little reminders.

Occupied with their own life  lovers  families.

BPD,why do people keep asking to reach out when nobody actually cares? ,"I’ve been going through this intense depressive phase  and the chronic feeling of emptiness just won’t go away. it really feels like there’s no hope. I reached out my bf  we’ve been dating for 5 years and had to move to different places  so been in a ldr since 2 months  and things have been getting worse than usual. I just feel like he doesn’t care about me  and I know maybe I’m just splitting and that’s why I think that  but it’s also the way he talks and responds and behaves with me. I never talk about our relationship to anyone  so I have no insight from other people  and im not able to recognise things that are wrong  and I constantly feel misunderstood  but then because of my stupid brain I try to rationalize it by thinking that im the problem  it’s the way I react and behave  even when it might be something that he did. I just don’t know what to think anymore. 
I’ve reached out to him multiple times  honestly just to hear a few words of reassurance  that it’ll be okay and that i have people who care about me  because it really feels like i have no one. But the things he’s said instead has made me crumble and spiral down even deeper. “Stop repeating the problem”  “ask for help from people around you  I can’t keep counselling you”  “it won’t be okay”  “don’t be a pit of weakness” etc amongst other things. 
I hate that people are like reach out  people care  you just need to talk about it  and then what? get ignored? I don’t even know the point of this post honestly  im just tired and i really want to give up.
I felt like I would die and was really going through one of the worst episodes last night  and I didn’t want to text him  but just needed someone badly  his reply was “it’s a bad phase it’ll pass”. I guess he’s right and im just overreacting. and then I texted again that I really need help and I apologised for annoying him by texting again and again the same thing  still waiting for his reply.

I know it's usually not the case and it probably isn't  but right now I just feel so isolated and like everyone in my life is tired of me and my problems and would just prefer if I was happy and normal all the time.

I recently went to my current doctor who I changed specifically for my mental health to get a mhcp (mental health care plan) only after trying to kill myself and my doctor seeing my scars did I finally get medically recognised bpd apart of my mhcp.

BPD,The best way I’d describe BPD is,"You feel like you are a child who was forcibly put in an adult body. It’s like you missed 10 years of your life and you’ve landed in a position where emotionally you don’t have the tools to survive. You don’t understand the responsibilities you have nor can you confront them. 
You’re constantly going after immediate gratification; even though you’ll know it may land you in trouble later.

Emotions are hard. You are extremely reactive. You cry so easily and every little inconvenience feels like the end of the world. You create havoc when things don’t go your way because you don’t know how to control your emotions.
You do understand nuance in the world  but your brain can’t but just categorize people and things as black or white.

The world is extremely boring. More often than not  you feel like you’re missing out on something special. An adventure. An opportunity. But you’re paralyzed by the fact that you feel powerless and so damn empty all the time.

You just want to be loved and cared for. But you lack the emotional stability to return the affections properly. Just like a kid who is loved by their mom  only by virtue of being her child  you want such an extreme connection with someone else. You want to feel inherently special to someone. But sometimes you end up unwillingly taking more than you can give.
Being alone hurts  you feel abandoned. You feel like you’ll never be cared for again. But just a show of affection can completely change your mood and brighten your day.


You love to make people happy. You see the good in everyone. You just want acceptance in this world. You want to find your niche  your identity  your clique. You want someone to tell you it’s okay. Everything is okay. And that everything will be fine. 
The monster beneath the bed is not real. The monster inside the closet is not real. 
But there’s nobody to tell you that. Nobody can understand your irrational fears  because they expect you to act like a grown up and “to stop being so dramatic”. They think you do it on purpose or that you lack self-restraint.
But you don’t wish harm. You do want to do better. You want to be helped. Held. And taught how to live. You want someone to be patient with you  because growing up and learning how to live is not easy.
You just want to be treated warmly and helped by the very world who stopped you from emotionally maturing. By those you stunted your growth  but now expect you to act like a proper adult.",1928,144,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/soo51t/the_best_way_id_describe_bpd_is/
BPD,What if nobody cares about me?,"To start im planning to talk to my therapist about this but may not get to it for a bit. 

What are you supposed to do if no one cares about you? I know this isnt 100% true as I think my family cares about me but its just not the same. I have 1 close friend. I would consider him to be my best friend but idk if he feels the same towards me. I feel the same even with other people though. Even ones that dont know I have bpd. I dont know if this is reality or the way I feel about things.

Im always the one who sends the first text  and first to ask to hang out or do something with them. Im the only one who is willing to travel to spend time. Im always ready to go help if needed (Ex. We are car bois and if one of our cars breaks).

Nobody texts me first  asks to do something with me  is willing to come over to my house  or is willing to come help me. I dont get invited to anything. All of my relationships feel so one sided. Im the only one putting in effort and I feel like they are just there so they don't feel bad because they know im lonely. The only thing close to this is my friend is willing to drop me off / pick me up from Spravato once a week and let me be at his house while It wears off. I feel like he does it because if he didnt I would probably unalive myself.  A group of us play video games together once a week but I feel like I get ignored half the time. Anytime im with 2 or more people I feel like a thirdwheel. 

Ive been trying to find a girlfriend on dating apps for the last two years and have maybe secured like 4 first dates. I dont get alot of matches and a large majority of those that do dont seem interested in learning more about me or just give the most boring answers to questions ever. Im not perfect and holding conversations but they make it so much harder by not giving me anything to work off of. 

I just dont know what to do. Im afraid to confront them about it because then Ill just get cut off and have no one. I would be coping so much better if I could find someone to care  and I cant. ",6,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/15oe910/what_if_nobody_cares_about_me/
BPD,Does anyone else find it sad that nobody will care for us as much as we care for them,"I care so deeply about the people in my life that it’s painful. I’m sure u guys can relate.

And it’s not their fault because the way I get attached to people is unhealthy.

Sometimes I think about the fact that my boyfriend will never know what it’s like to care as much as I do. And my friends probably don’t think about me nearly as much as I think about them. When I was young I’d stay up crying every night thinking about the fact that the people I love will die someday.

Doesn’t matter how short it was. It had nuked any last feelings I had for the ex and now I’m obsessed with them. They’re going off doing something in X city and I haven’t probed because it’s not my business.

BPD,i feel insane and so alone,"i went through a break up after a three month relationship that began as just fwb but quickly became more after he encouraged me to trust him and let him in and “he really really liked me” and he wasn’t “going to hurt me.” i thought we both really liked each other as he did tell me he did and we were making plans for the near future which felt normal and healthy and like things were progressing healthily and well. 

after three months he ended it but we kept going back and forth for three more months where we would talk  see each other  hook up  and he would block and unblock me. he would tell me he missed me  still liked me  still cared about me  then would usually block me after about few days to a couple weeks of talking and seeing each other again. after i had been blocked again for almost a month he came back and spent the entire day with me and telling me how he missed me and wanted me and needed me and we did hook up. shortly after that he was incredibly mean and cruel and cold and basically said i didn’t mean anything to him and that day didn’t mean anything to him and everything he said was because he was “high.” in his defense  he’s bipolar and unmedicated and in a very clear downwards spiral that consists of a lot of drug abuse. he also told me that day he was doing really bad and was really unhappy. he is most certainly my FP and the past few weeks i have felt like i have been absolutely losing my mind as he had never been so like. mean before. it was actually so horrible. 

i basically tried to self medicate with a lot of drinking and drugs the past two weeks and i finally hit a wall this past sunday and have been completely sober for the past 72 hours but like i have been physically unable to be alone. i was at home by myself for like an hour sunday and felt like i was going INSANE and was crying felt like i was on the edge of a panic attack and ended up going to one of my friend’s houses. we have been together since but i felt like she needed a break but the idea of going home alone made me feel very sick to my stomach and anxious and panicky. i ended up going to another friend’s where i currently am laying on her couch.

 i can’t stop thinking about my FP and also feeling like i will be alone forever and no one will ever love me (in a romantic sense) and that i am never ever good enough. during those two weeks i also hooked up with a guy i had been casually talking to on and off for about three weeks and i did think he was into me but i wasn’t like really thinking anything more about it but then we hooked up and spent like two days in person together and then he just stopped talking to me  so i went from not really caring about it at all to being completely obsessed with him and wanting to talk to him and see him and hang out with him  but at the same time i’m still thinking about my FP. 

i just feel so alone and insane and anxious and like i will be alone forever and never have anyone and i’m terrified to be physically alone right now to the point i get very anxious just thinking about it and i do not know what to do. 

i currently take lamictal (and just got upped to 100mg a day a few days ago) and have a therapy appointment tomorrow which i know will help but like right now i just feel horrible and insane and anxious and panicky and unlovable and unlikable and i know i have my friends i know they care but like unfortunately all of my self worth and sense of self comes from if someone likes me or wants me and so after the coldness from my FP after we spent a day together that made me feel happy for the first time in three months and then the essential ghosting from the guy i had been talking to (not like talking talking but consistent communication) after we hung out for like two days straight and had sex i think i am just really struggling (and i’m sure the two weeks of non-stop attempts at self medicating didnt help) with what feels like everything.

BPD,Can sex be a form of self harm? ,"(TW: Sexual content/mentions of SA.) 

So I use sex for validation. I’m actually relatively vanilla  I typically like soft and romantic sex. To feel appreciated  maybe a bit of a praise kink and the only relatively “taboo” thing I’m actually into is public stuff. 

But  I use sex to keep people in my life. Even if they are mean to me  no good for me  etc. I have trouble saying no & sometimes I feel like I deserve to be used. I cry during rough sex but I hide it well. I just take it because at least the person I want is touching me and giving me attention. I agree to things I am not comfortable with. I think this is because with my ex  I would say no to things and be shamed  coerced or even forced to perform so I just stopped saying no as a coping mechanism. At least I know what’s gonna happen and can control it. 

Sex with the person I’m seeing isn’t always enjoyable. At first  she was super loving and attentive to my needs. Then she said we need to amp it up because she’s losing interest. This sent me into a spiral and now I’m getting drunk just to feel freaky enough to do things I don’t even want to do. It doesn’t turn me on to be degraded. It feels harmful  but I just go with it. It’s consensual  I even ask for it even though I know I’ll feel like shit during and afterwards. All to please someone who doesn’t really seem to care about me that much. All to feel pretty  to feel loved in a weird and wicked way. 

I have reduced myself to an object instead of advocating for myself  knowing my worth  etc. I’m just like yeah use me  do whatever. Hurt me if it turns you on. Bite me  choke me  call me names. Whatever you need to do as long as you stay. 

I’m ashamed.

BPD,as a quiet borderline  i don’t think people realize how much it takes (TW: self harm/suicide ED),"and by this i mean  how much it takes to try to appear as “normal” as possible. the amount of mental and physical energy and time it takes for me to tell myself to calm down  that i’m okay  or to internally yell at myself to “shut the fuck up” or to “just fucking stop”.

it quite literally is a daily battle. sometimes an hourly battle  and i’m getting close to my breaking point.

it is so exhausting trying to keep my emotions at bay. not openly/publicly split on people. not to lash out at people or openly have public meltdowns. trying to be a great student  a great employee  great friend lover daughter  etc. etc. etc. the list just keeps fucking going.

and let’s not forget how hard it is to stay in recovery of self harm  my ED  and to not start thinking of ways to kill myself when something goes wrong  or i think someone is going to leave me  when conflict arises with someone  the list goes on and on.

lately i have been so fucking anxious and on edge and so fucking depressed. suicide has been on my mind a lot as of late and i have no one to talk to about it...so i’m just going to leave this here. thank you to anyone who listened",798,101,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/nnsgcr/as_a_quiet_borderline_i_dont_think_people_realize/

So I sh to make myself feel anything other than that “feeling” and kind of make myself feel like life is not as “boring” or “routine” as I think. 
Sometimes I also sh to deal with anxiety  like to distract myself from it. I actually sh to deal with any intense emotion.

BPD,you don’t have bpd you are 12,"ADDING CLARIFICATION RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THIS POST SO LITERACY STOPS GOING OUT THE WINDOW:
i am not saying minors shouldn’t seek therapy or mental help  i am not saying self diagnosis is bad  i am not saying there aren’t young people with bpd  i am not saying bpd symptoms can’t show that early  i am not saying there has never been someone under 18 to be diagnosed and i am for sure not saying that these children are perfectly okay and don’t need help


i have noticed an influx of posts made by extremely young individuals and i would like to say 

i understand you are having a hard time  i understand emotions are not easy to deal with 

but i need you to understand  bpd is a complex disorder  and no there isn’t a way we can help  you get diagnosed  no advice we can give you will help  underage people only get diagnosed with bpd in EXTREMELY special circumstances 

you have to be 18 to be diagnosed with bpd and some professionals don’t even recommend that and instead recommend waiting till you’re 20   you’re brain is not developed enough to know for sure wether it is the complex illness of bpd or simply the complex illness of pubescent hormones

bpd traits diagnosis is reserved for those who are suspected of bpd but cannot yet get a diagnosis due to age and development  but even then your psych might go back on that and say no i messed up you don’t have bpd  ive seen it happen many times.

the point im trying to make here is  a lot of these posts made by underage individuals seem to perpetuate the stigma already put out by neurotypicals  and often i see young people asking for help to be diagnosed  
and to be blunt you do not have bpd and posting about how you are an abusive individual and need to get diagnosed is not helping anybody including yourself and is damaging to a community you are not yet even part of  sometimes it’s okay to wait your turn and take your time and when it comes to posts like that and posts where you are giving other people advice  it would be best to wait on that  obviously be apart of the discussion but starting a preface of “i have bpd” when you maybe don’t is destructive 

tldr;
there are a lot of minors on this sub posting about how they HAVE bpd when there is only a 50% chance they actually do  and they are posting harmful stigmatizing posts.


edit: i was diagnosed the second i turned 18  they knew i had it but followed local guidelines  i was being treated for it since i was 14  i did DBT therapy 4 times before i turned 20 it did help me not have extreme behaviours as an adult. 
the point of this post is to not discourage getting mental help  you should definitely go to a therapist and receive help regardless of if you do or do not have bpd  the point of this post is that people who aren’t diagnosed shouldn’t be leading discussions and directing answers to others on what they potentially do not have",1719,433,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1g4e5ld/you_dont_have_bpd_you_are_12/

BPD,In which ways are you self-destructive? (no self-harm  substance abuse  etc.),"Many therapists have told me that I'm very self-destructive. In the past  I've had suicidal attempts  but luckily for the last three years  I never laid a hand on myself. 

However  I've realized that there are other forms of my behavior that are self-destructive. For example  if I'm having a bad day I will skip meals on purpose. Sometimes I just stay in bed the whole day and I sleep  or just lying in bed and thinking ""I won't move even if I want to"". It's like I'm punishing myself on purpose  mostly when I fail at something  or have a fight with my parents at home.

I'm a person who takes a shower almost every day  or every second day  but when feeling down I won't do it. My mind is telling me ""it's not worth it  since you're a failure"". There is a part of me that hates how bad I smell and wants to take a shower  and the other part of me is stronger  making me a lazy bastard. 

I consider all these behaviors in my case self-destructive. And I was wondering in which ways are other people self-destructive considering their behavior.

BPD,You don’t need to be hospitalized for your BPD to be real.,"I’ve noticed a lot of people in BPD spaces talk about how many times they’ve been hospitalized  almost like it’s a measure of how ‘severe’ their BPD is. While I understand that hospitalization is a reality for many  it feels invalidating when people act like it’s a requirement for having BPD.

Me  myself  I have BPD but I’ve never been hospitalized for a suicide attempt. The only time I’ve gone to the hospital was for cutting too deep and needing stitches. That doesn’t mean my struggles aren’t real or that I don’t experience the intense emotions  impulsivity  and self-destructive behaviors that come with BPD.

Not everyone with BPD has been hospitalized. Some people struggle just as much but have different circumstances—maybe they hide it well  don’t have access to care  or just haven’t reached that point. That doesn’t mean their BPD is ‘less real’ or that they don’t suffer as much.

If you have BPD and feel invalidated by people who say you need to have been hospitalized to ‘prove’ you struggle  I see you. Your pain is just as real  and you don’t need to have a certain experience to ‘qualify’ for having BPD. Everyone’s journey is different  and none of them are more or less valid than others.

Mental illness isn’t a competition. BPD is already an invalidating disorder; we shouldn’t be invalidating each other too.",324,87,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1j0dz4t/you_dont_need_to_be_hospitalized_for_your_bpd_to/

There was not really a reason today  i have been going downhill for past weeks  with ups and downs. Today i woke up an old within 1h it escalated.

BPD,I am the one walking on eggshells! I hate it!,"**Who can relate? I feel broken**

I don't tell my partner. I don't tell my therapist. I swallow it whole when something cuts deep. Because God forbid they adjust  or they tread lightly  for *me*. I can’t bear the thought of them having to *change*—not because I asked them to  but because they’re afraid of breaking me.

I don’t want their caution. I don’t want their filtered words. I don’t want them calculating every sentence like it's a minefield.

Because *I* know exactly what that feels like. To overanalyze every word. To reread texts a dozen times  wondering if this one—this *single sentence*—might be too much. I know what it's like to speak as if you're defusing a bomb. To silence yourself before you even open your mouth. To live in fear of being ""too much."" To Hesitate. To dissect. To hold back.

*I* am the one walking on eggshells.

So I adapt. Every day  I contort myself into something smaller. I shrink. Quieter. Simpler. Easier to digest. I don't ask for what I need—I don't even *dare*—because I know how deep the spiral can go. I know what it's like to trigger a storm... and then have to survive it.

So I walk carefully. I carry the burden of “not making it worse.” I preempt the explosion. I suffer in silence. I bend  and bend... until I’m barely standing.

And the irony?? In trying to protect everyone from my chaos… I'm the one bleeding from the shards. I suffer in silence just to spare everyone else from my pain.",309,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1jrz23w/i_am_the_one_walking_on_eggshells_i_hate_it/

BPD,Recently lost my sweet baby (pet cat) and everything hurts so much,I feel intense grief since the few couple of hours ago that he passed. I'm not a stranger to losing cats and I know someday I'll have to come to terms with their passing being earlier than me. But Puppycat was just a baby  only a couple months old and would be half a year old being with me. It's so unfair. I took care of Puppycat since its birth and even fought my parents over keeping it and its siblings. I've come across a few premature pet passings  but Puppycat's hit the hardest. He was my baby. My long furry little baby who's afraid of the dark. My heart is breaking so much and everything from my head to my entire body is just hurting everywhere. I hate that having BPD means that I feel the pain physically too because everything just feels too real. Puppycat was my anchor whenever life went rough  but suddenly finding him laying coldly was enough to send me spiralling. It just hurts so much I can't breath. All I want is my little baby back. What makes matters worser is my phones got stolen a few weeks ago  so most of my videos or pictures of Puppycat is gone. I'm at a loss. I feel like my soul is empty. Please tell me something comforting  I know far too well about grief  I just need something to read and distract myself from this awful sadness.,5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1hdgucm/recently_lost_my_sweet_baby_pet_cat_and/
BPD,Why does everything hurt? ,All my emotions manifest as physical pain. I don't understand why no one stays in my life for long. I try so hard to mask everything I feel all the time. I work hard to push through all my emotions and appear to be normal from the outside and it just doesn't work. I feel like no one ever bothers to get to know me on a deeper level and no one in the world understands me. I don't ever remember a time in my life where I fit in or felt normal. I've always felt like an outsider. I have the worst social anxiety ever or I'm overly bubbly to the point of coming across as weird and over doing it. I don't know how to express what I'm feeling to people because I know they won't understand and just leave because they know I'm so hard to deal with.

BPD,The best way I’d describe BPD is,"You feel like you are a child who was forcibly put in an adult body. It’s like you missed 10 years of your life and you’ve landed in a position where emotionally you don’t have the tools to survive. You don’t understand the responsibilities you have nor can you confront them. 
You’re constantly going after immediate gratification; even though you’ll know it may land you in trouble later.

Emotions are hard. You are extremely reactive. You cry so easily and every little inconvenience feels like the end of the world. You create havoc when things don’t go your way because you don’t know how to control your emotions.
You do understand nuance in the world  but your brain can’t but just categorize people and things as black or white.

The world is extremely boring. More often than not  you feel like you’re missing out on something special. An adventure. An opportunity. But you’re paralyzed by the fact that you feel powerless and so damn empty all the time.

You just want to be loved and cared for. But you lack the emotional stability to return the affections properly. Just like a kid who is loved by their mom  only by virtue of being her child  you want such an extreme connection with someone else. You want to feel inherently special to someone. But sometimes you end up unwillingly taking more than you can give.
Being alone hurts  you feel abandoned. You feel like you’ll never be cared for again. But just a show of affection can completely change your mood and brighten your day.


You love to make people happy. You see the good in everyone. You just want acceptance in this world. You want to find your niche  your identity  your clique. You want someone to tell you it’s okay. Everything is okay. And that everything will be fine. 
The monster beneath the bed is not real. The monster inside the closet is not real. 
But there’s nobody to tell you that. Nobody can understand your irrational fears  because they expect you to act like a grown up and “to stop being so dramatic”. They think you do it on purpose or that you lack self-restraint.
But you don’t wish harm. You do want to do better. You want to be helped. Held. And taught how to live. You want someone to be patient with you  because growing up and learning how to live is not easy.
You just want to be treated warmly and helped by the very world who stopped you from emotionally maturing. By those you stunted your growth  but now expect you to act like a proper adult.",1930,144,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/soo51t/the_best_way_id_describe_bpd_is/

BPD,you don’t have bpd you are 12,"ADDING CLARIFICATION RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THIS POST SO LITERACY STOPS GOING OUT THE WINDOW:
i am not saying minors shouldn’t seek therapy or mental help  i am not saying self diagnosis is bad  i am not saying there aren’t young people with bpd  i am not saying bpd symptoms can’t show that early  i am not saying there has never been someone under 18 to be diagnosed and i am for sure not saying that these children are perfectly okay and don’t need help


i have noticed an influx of posts made by extremely young individuals and i would like to say 

i understand you are having a hard time  i understand emotions are not easy to deal with 

but i need you to understand  bpd is a complex disorder  and no there isn’t a way we can help  you get diagnosed  no advice we can give you will help  underage people only get diagnosed with bpd in EXTREMELY special circumstances 

you have to be 18 to be diagnosed with bpd and some professionals don’t even recommend that and instead recommend waiting till you’re 20   you’re brain is not developed enough to know for sure wether it is the complex illness of bpd or simply the complex illness of pubescent hormones

bpd traits diagnosis is reserved for those who are suspected of bpd but cannot yet get a diagnosis due to age and development  but even then your psych might go back on that and say no i messed up you don’t have bpd  ive seen it happen many times.

the point im trying to make here is  a lot of these posts made by underage individuals seem to perpetuate the stigma already put out by neurotypicals  and often i see young people asking for help to be diagnosed  
and to be blunt you do not have bpd and posting about how you are an abusive individual and need to get diagnosed is not helping anybody including yourself and is damaging to a community you are not yet even part of  sometimes it’s okay to wait your turn and take your time and when it comes to posts like that and posts where you are giving other people advice  it would be best to wait on that  obviously be apart of the discussion but starting a preface of “i have bpd” when you maybe don’t is destructive 

tldr;
there are a lot of minors on this sub posting about how they HAVE bpd when there is only a 50% chance they actually do  and they are posting harmful stigmatizing posts.


edit: i was diagnosed the second i turned 18  they knew i had it but followed local guidelines  i was being treated for it since i was 14  i did DBT therapy 4 times before i turned 20 it did help me not have extreme behaviours as an adult. 
the point of this post is to not discourage getting mental help  you should definitely go to a therapist and receive help regardless of if you do or do not have bpd  the point of this post is that people who aren’t diagnosed shouldn’t be leading discussions and directing answers to others on what they potentially do not have",1722,433,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1g4e5ld/you_dont_have_bpd_you_are_12/

BPD,28F suicidal and I’m giving up on any hope of a happy future  the universe has decided I don’t deserve it ,"28F - I’m just so sick of not feeling good enough. 

When I was younger I dreamed of getting married  having a family and children. I’m turning 30 next year and I’ve still never met anyone that wants me as more than a brief fling. 

I’ve done all the things that are meant to make you happy and develop as an individual - I gave up drinking alcohol  I stopped smoking  I’ve lost weight and only weigh 59kg  I’ve gone solo travelling  I’ve been to 4 different therapists and you know what after all this.

 I’m still alone  miserable and hopeless. I don’t think this will ever get better. Everyone I met travelling had holiday romances and I’ve not even been on a date for almost a year.

I’ve felt like this for years and tbh I just don’t even see this getting better - if I’ve not been good enough to commit to before  I can’t imagine anyone would want to now I’ve got wrinkles and age spots. 

I used to be passionate about my career but I have no desire to do further study anymore as it just doesn’t excite me. I’m fed up of having to congratulate everyone else’s success and celebrate their life milestones which I’ll never achieve… 

I don’t even want to see all 7 continents no more as I’m so tired of doing everything alone and no one to share it with. 

Honestly I’ve given myself one year and if nothing changes I will throw myself in front of a train

BPD,I give up.,"I wrote a post here a few days ago about how my BPD recently caused me to lose my family. 

The only man who’s ever truly loved me  would have done anything for me. I split on him and terminated our pregnancy out of fear that he would abandon me during the pregnancy. The fear was keeping me up at night. I was so afraid to be a mom  even moreso afraid to be a single mom  even though he tried everyday to support me and show me that he’d never leave. I just couldn’t trust it.

Now here I am with nothing. No loving partner. No beautiful child growing inside of me. Just me and my deranged  fucked up brain and thoughts. 

I feel like a shell. Unworthy of anything. A disgusting vile creature. I’m so fucking sick of this disorder. I’m so fucking sick of myself.

The tearful apologies for how I’ve treated him are at this point in one ear and out the other. The man I love  is broken beyond repair and it’s my doing. The family I would have had - the one that every BPD dreams of having - is now just a fantasy in my mind that I keep replaying  replaying  replaying

I don’t know how long I’m going to be able to live with myself. The guilt is too much  the pain is too much. I’ve been living with this for far too long. It’s all too much.

BPD,I got broken up with and im losing my mind,"My FP broke up with me over text yesterday and I have been genuinely losing my mind over this. 

I had known this guy for over a year  we were really close friends and I was in a toxic relationship at the time and he helped thru some stuff with that. Once that relationship ended  we got even closer and ended up getting together. It was really good at first but the more comfortable i got with him the more explosive my emotions became. 

The first major incident caused by conflict was when he did something and I got angry and scratched his arm. When this happened he told me he needed time to wrap his head around it which is something i understood. After that we were back to normal and better than ever. A couple of days ago he was over at my place and I got triggered into an episode where I ended up harming myself in front him while we were arguing. He was shaking and started crying which made me snap out of my disassociation and my episode and i comforted him. After this he proceeded to have sex with me and we slept together that night. The next day he tells me that was too much for him and he wants a break from the rls. As someone who has a big big big fear of abandonment  a break didnt work for me which lead to us arguing again. Throughout this entire argument he only kept talking ab his mental health and his side of the story not considering how much these episodes impact me and how much a break would actually hurt me. During this i ended up splitting. Shortly after he sends me a text saying this relationship is too much for his mental health and while he loves me he cannot do this anymore.  

When we were just friends and things like this would happen in my other relationship  he would be extremely supportive and understanding of me. During the good times of the relationship he was so loving and so good to me that him doing something like this seems impossible. 

I am now in a position where I am in so much emotional pain that I do not know what to do. I am blocked everywhere  he doesnt want to talk to me and I genuinely do not what to do. 
Do i find a way to reach out to him? Do i wait n give him time before I try to talk to him again? Is it really over? I am genuinely losing my mind over this ",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1is54zu/i_got_broken_up_with_and_im_losing_my_mind/
BPD,I'm a mess. How would you want to be broken up with?,"My BPD partner can be lovely  she can also be a nightmare- but she's been through a lot  but recently I reached the end of my tether.

I feel imprisoned with her  I've broken my hand in one of her episodes and fell down a fight of stairs and been punched. and my hand doesn't look like it will heal up  she always hits herself when things get bad or demands I do everything. recently in one of her episodes  I've started smashing a door against on my head till I fell to the floor. She's kicked me out many times only to change her minds when my stuff is packed and her saying you're not leaving and physically restraining me. The neighbours have often asked me if they can call emergency services over her. She recently went mad at me kicking me out on the morning my gran was thought to be dying and I was rushing over to see her in and it was this time I think I finally made my mind up. I have also have a dodgy stomach and this is 100% triggered by stress and anxiety  something that I now feel all the time with her. I can feel myself getting sick when she touches me sometimes.

she called me a hundred times whilst I drove to my grand and when I picked up she was panicking about her reproductive health  when we kind of spoke about us I said I didn't feel what I used to for her  and she said she rarely does for me but sometimes does.

we haven't had sex in ages now as I've felt this connection lost but also I've realised my sexuality also isn't what I thought it was and I actually am attracted to feminine-looking transgenders too and want to have sex with transgenders women with penises. My partner doesn't let me watch porn and I haven't ejaculated in about 3 weeks because she would be jealous  I tell her I dream about trans every night now  which I do and I want to act on it but would never cheat on her.

I feel pretty awful about all this. When she's not in episode mode  she can be lovely especially when she knows I'm really struggling. However I no longer feel the closeness to her  I no longer want her comfort and I feel bad that she is gonna be feeling rejected. But she also makes it feel like I can't leave and she's gonna be screwed without me there  but equally me staying with her is gonna stop her from finding someone.

There's several selfish reasons to stay. But the only thing I should do is leave. But its so hard  I've tried about 10 times but this has always been when her moods are awful not when she seems relatively stable. She also wants a kid and with her my head is sexually I think a kid would be the worst thing (plus she's so unstable- but mental health support is really tough in our borough of London).",1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1i77udr/im_a_mess_how_would_you_want_to_be_broken_up_with/
BPD,My close internet friend of 7 years cut me off after I attempted suicide. I'm feeling broken. ,"As the title says. I attempted suicide after a major BPD episode and I told my friend. She waited until I was in the hospital and safe before she wrote a paragraph saying she is done with the friendship due to my mental issues causing her too much stress and that the ""bads of the friendship outweighs the good"". 

I understand why she done that  and it is a wake up call for me. But I can't help but feel that this is proof I'm completely unlikable. I keep on rereading her last message and it is almost making me want to attempt again. 

I understand I'm hard to like because I have a lot of struggles  but I just need some support right now. My friend circle is getting smaller and smaller and I feel terrible. I'm trying to get better. I'm on meds and I am in therapy  but it is so hard to get better without much of s support circle.

He had to leave for California for 6 weeks to do some job training. I have been all over the place - a lot of ""oh he doesn't want to talk because he's realizing he doesn't like me anymore""  ""he's too nice to break up over text so he's waiting till he comes back""  and of course A LOT of splitting. 
The newest thing is communication - I was trying to ask questions about his day and what he was doing and he told me to stop with the questions. I was making it too much like a quiz than a conversation (Do not throw hate on him for this  I have acknowledged it) and that if I give him more of a breath in a conversation then he can be more open cause he really really wants to be.

I told him I felt like he doesn't want to speak to me at all because I'm the one who has to start all of these conversations. And then he did what he has always done - explained to me calmly and rationally what I couldn't understand with my BPD lenses. 
I felt so awful  he was absolutely right. I thought the medication and therapy were working. I don't want to him to leave me because I keep ""acting crazy""  but after all this time I still can't ""keep it together"".

I feel too mentally ill for a relationship  but I love him so much. 

 I'm scared of him leaving me because he can talk me through my BPD moments  but if I keep having these moments he'll get tired of me ",3,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1fzpv4a/i_dont_think_ive_ever_felt_so_broken_by_my_bpd_i/
BPD,My FP and I have stopped talking  and I'm heart broken.,"I had a new FP that I had been talking to for weeks. We would keep the phone on at night and wake each other up. It was wonderful. We were hanging out in a group call  and when I logged off  I was hoping she would reach back out to me. I saw she was hanging out with someone else. And kept hanging out with him. For hours  without calling me. When I rejoined the group chat  they were having a lively conversation  and he said ""oh look who's gracing us with his presence."" she said nothing of support. They were exchanging songs through DMs and talking about it  and when I said I wanted to hear the songs too  he just laughed and said ""oh  poor noscopeme"" and they stopped talking. 

I felt completely unwanted  and said that I didn't want to intrude on them. I didn't talk to her for a day  and she asked what was going on. I said I felt embarassed and unwanted  and she said I didn't need to be alone  but that it was okay if I wanted to be. I just needed to settle down  and find something to focus on. She asked me to reach out when I was finished hanging out with my abusive father  and when I did  she hasn't texted back.

I feel like something like this is always going to happen to me. I'll get a favorite person  they'll find someone they like better  and that will be that.",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1fnhep1/my_fp_and_i_have_stopped_talking_and_im_heart/
BPD,Please help me. I'm lost and so broken and hurt.,"I had the worst day of my life yesterday. I cried for 7 hours straight and my partner did not want to let me hang up at all during the entire call and that was the reason behind why it went on for so long. It was so horrible and he was of no help and useless. I know it's long  but please read because I feel like I have no one else. Im feeling so lost.

**Some background:**
My partner and I are long distance. We've been together for 4 years and this November we're planning to finally meet out in Tokyo. I want for us to visit the Ghibli Museum but tickets are notoriously hard to buy. There's a randomized queue system and the purchase window only happens once a month at a specific time. 

**Yesterday:**
We had planned for weeks to practice buying tickets in this month's window. We've each prepped 5 devices each and had woken up 2 hours earlier in anticipation of the big event at 9am. But at 8:45 he tells me his family needs help to move a couch in a different part of town or something and he needs to go with them. This sent me on a *tailspin* and I start hyperventilating. We had talked about this for weeks and he was just going to drop me out of no where. He had not told his family that today he'd be busy with this thing we planned and told me that ""They are outside right now honking the car"" and that he had to go. I am furious at his lack of communication with his family and start yelling at him as his dad walks in and hears him sobbing on the call. His dad decides he doesn't need to go and my partner ends up staying behind.

But I am livid and extremely upset that I could be tossed aside despite us planning for it for so long. (TW) I am so upset that I reached for a knife to SH while he was on the call with me. We argued for a long time and after a couple hours  he asked if he could take a nap when we have not even resolved this??? He even fell asleep while we were talking despite me telling him that it was important for him to show his commitment to our relationship by ironing this out. I called him out on it but he denies it. 

He tries 'comforting' me but everything he says feels like he's trying to find the ""right answer"" as he tries multiple approaches – like its some sort of checklist of things to say. This sends me even deeper into a horrible place. I could not feel any empathy from his words and when I called him out about what he was saying is making me feel and he said ""I don't know what you want from me."" – confirming my beliefs. The call ends with me in tears  barely able to catch my breath. At this point I feel so  so broken and so worthless and unloved. 

I cried some more until I slept and when I woke up  I do not see any texts or calls from him. This next part makes me feel so ashamed and pathetic because I call him up. He says he wants to make it up to me but what he suggests is something so low effort that it makes me feel even more unloved and unappreciated. He says it's late and there's not much we could do. I'm hurt once again and told him I expected more. Me having to prompt him for this also hurts me because it feels like I am the driving force for this entire relationship. As though nothing would happen if I never raised it up. I another argument happens but I'll jump ahead. TLDR he says he'll plan something for the next day (Sunday). I said I will never again be prompting him anymore. I will not be making the first call anymore.

**Today:**
I wake up in the day and wait for his call. Nothing. I'm hurt and upset so I do what chores I have to keep myself busy and put on a show. I figured I can't rely on him anymore. I will have to take care of myself.

4:30pm he finally calls me. Says his alarm didn't go off. I told him to fuck off and that he fucked any shot of mending this. That it is almost the end of the day and tmr I'll have to go back to work. He starts crying and saying he made a e-card for me but I'm so upset I can't care about it. Some e-card is going to fix this? After the shit he put me through yesterday and the no-show today?? Actions speak louder than words and his no-show really showed me that he doesn't care at all about making this up for me. I hang up and block him.

BPD,My relationship is over and I'm heart broken ,"I'm a 31 year old male   I have bpd and over the years I managed to get it somehow under control. Over the past year  I have been in a relationship with this girl  we are in a distant relationship and we don't often see each other. I loved her over anything in the world. We had a lot of issue because she comes from strict parents who don't allowed her to do anything  so I was always the one going there to see her. Long story short   I had a lot of things to pay this year and I was under a lot of stress   I asked her next year to made my life easier and come to see me here so I could save some.money and stop stressing  she kinda told me that she didn't know if the parents would allow her   and from there   I kinda had a sense of betrayal  after all I have done for her ( and she had done for me too ) and my bpd started to became worse and worse.by the day. Every week I was splitting ok her   block her   unblock her   everything went down to hill and I completely destroyed her self esteem and security in me. One month ago  she was begging me to spend more time together  I felt overwhelmed and I broke up with her cousing her great pain   useless to say I regretted it straight away . She was going to give me a.chance again   but yesterday (while to get a bit over the heartbroken she decided to go see a friend ) I had another split   accusing her to going there to meet some.other guy  calling her friend name and stuff like that. I had never seen her so mad before   my heart was broken   I didn't mean it   I was just scared of losing her but now she says she is over my bullshit  that I'm a disrespectful paranoid who ruined the only time she was thinking about myself  that I need to get my shit together and I'm so  so sorry and heartbroken  I didn't mean to hurt her. She doesn't even watch my stories on Instagram and I'm to ashamed.of sending her a message after what I did... I did hurt and destroyed the only person who has ever tried to understand me  .I caused her so much hurt I don't deserve anything and I don't know what to do
. I haven't left my bed in two days   no eating only smoking cigarettes and I can't do anything but crying. I'm the worst person ever existed ",5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1exyb5h/my_relationship_is_over_and_im_heart_broken/
BPD,I miss you,"I just need to get this off my chest.

My sister (with BPD if that isn't clear) committed suicide October 3rd. 

I recently got into her computer (she definitely didn't want me getting into her accounts  but na na na boo boo 😝 <3).

I recovered pretty much her entire digital life. Emails  iMessages  therapy exercises  many correspondences with her therapist  her diary  etc.).

I'm her younger brother. I know she intentionally kept things from me  because *""[She didn't] want to burden people with [her] issues""*. My mother (sweetest mom in the world  basically the female Mr. Rogers) also kept things from me  because she *""didn't want to scare me""*. 

I was in the dark about a lot of things. I have a lot of guilt about this. I looked up the disorder online when she was diagnosed  but dude those textbook definitions and lists of symptoms did not help me fully appreciate what it's actually like living with the disorder. I should've talked to her more about it. I don't know if she wouldv'e really opened up if I did.  I have a lot of guilt about that.

I think that's why I wanted so badly to get into her computer. I wanted to know what it's like in her brain. 

Now like I said  I recovered incredibly personal and intimate information between her and her therapist  amongst other things. Things she never would have told us. I can understand why telling other people those things would be hard. But the more I learn  the **PROUDER** I am. Managing her disorder was a **full time fucking job**. And she was diligent and responsible about it  she did everything you're supposed to do. She studied neuroscience and was taking the MCAT (or some acronym related to pre-med). She had folders of coping mechanisms  BPD workbooks  catalogs of quotes from her therapist  all color coded and organized  again a full time job basically. She was actively working hard everyday  just to exist. And from the outside looking in  she seemed to be managing. I hate how oblivious I was. 

She was a fucking SUPER HERO. I saw a post on the front page that I couldn't agree more with. If you put her brain in me for a single day  there's no way I'd last anywhere near as long as she did. 

It breaks my heart unbearably knowing what she was dealing with. She just had shit fucking luck. Her brain was broken and everyone told her to do this and do that  and she did  for decades  and honestly I feel she had every right to end it. I don't know if that's dangerous to say  but I know I don't want her just suffering through life.

I'm kind of spiraling now I just love you Sirena and I miss you so much and I'm so so fucking proud of you. I've never felt anything even close to this level of emotional pain  and it's not even close to what you were dealing with every fucking day.

BPD,you don’t have bpd you are 12,"ADDING CLARIFICATION RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THIS POST SO LITERACY STOPS GOING OUT THE WINDOW:
i am not saying minors shouldn’t seek therapy or mental help  i am not saying self diagnosis is bad  i am not saying there aren’t young people with bpd  i am not saying bpd symptoms can’t show that early  i am not saying there has never been someone under 18 to be diagnosed and i am for sure not saying that these children are perfectly okay and don’t need help


i have noticed an influx of posts made by extremely young individuals and i would like to say 

i understand you are having a hard time  i understand emotions are not easy to deal with 

but i need you to understand  bpd is a complex disorder  and no there isn’t a way we can help  you get diagnosed  no advice we can give you will help  underage people only get diagnosed with bpd in EXTREMELY special circumstances 

you have to be 18 to be diagnosed with bpd and some professionals don’t even recommend that and instead recommend waiting till you’re 20   you’re brain is not developed enough to know for sure wether it is the complex illness of bpd or simply the complex illness of pubescent hormones

bpd traits diagnosis is reserved for those who are suspected of bpd but cannot yet get a diagnosis due to age and development  but even then your psych might go back on that and say no i messed up you don’t have bpd  ive seen it happen many times.

the point im trying to make here is  a lot of these posts made by underage individuals seem to perpetuate the stigma already put out by neurotypicals  and often i see young people asking for help to be diagnosed  
and to be blunt you do not have bpd and posting about how you are an abusive individual and need to get diagnosed is not helping anybody including yourself and is damaging to a community you are not yet even part of  sometimes it’s okay to wait your turn and take your time and when it comes to posts like that and posts where you are giving other people advice  it would be best to wait on that  obviously be apart of the discussion but starting a preface of “i have bpd” when you maybe don’t is destructive 

tldr;
there are a lot of minors on this sub posting about how they HAVE bpd when there is only a 50% chance they actually do  and they are posting harmful stigmatizing posts.


edit: i was diagnosed the second i turned 18  they knew i had it but followed local guidelines  i was being treated for it since i was 14  i did DBT therapy 4 times before i turned 20 it did help me not have extreme behaviours as an adult. 
the point of this post is to not discourage getting mental help  you should definitely go to a therapist and receive help regardless of if you do or do not have bpd  the point of this post is that people who aren’t diagnosed shouldn’t be leading discussions and directing answers to others on what they potentially do not have",1724,433,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1g4e5ld/you_dont_have_bpd_you_are_12/
BPD,Date said I was “ empty & needed healing” My BPD is spiraling right now HELP?,"
So I went on a first date this evening with a guy who showered me in compliments  called me every day this past week told me how much he liked me . And we enjoyed each other over the phone and the app we met on. But once we went out on a date he flat out told me. “ you don’t seem established enough or healed and you have no real hobbies you’re like a empty shell “. It was devastating because I tried my best to act normal &  talk a lot ( he doesn’t know I have BPD) & I didn’t lie about my life at all to him he just doesn’t know i have BPD . And he still could tell I wasnt “ normal “ & something was off & said I needed “ deep healing “ he already knows I’m in therapy anyways 🙄. He even went as far as to say that he felt like he texted & talked on the phone with a totally different girl in the same body. I started tearing up then he made the waiter get boxes for our food . My  personality was so unbearable to him that he didn’t even want to finish dinner. I’ve never had a guy be so dismissive and disrespectful. Maybe I should have told him I had BPD beforehand? Idk but I feel like I’ll never find love I want marriage and kids so bad & im 30 I should have that. Was I wrong or was he the jerk ?

BPD,Really Need Help - Pathological Jealousy,"Hi ! 

I am struggling really badly with pathological jealousy in my relationship. 

I honestly just now found out what it was via google search but it seems to be exactly what is going on . 

I am Fairly certain i have BPD although I am undiagnosed. I have a reluctance to seeing a professional for help  medication  or therapy . 

Basically I have always been insecure in my relationship. But I experienced more mild BPD type issues and was able to quickly rationalize and calm down. Although social media stalking has always been a big issue for me.

Last Halloween  my boyfriend went to a Halloween party with his coworkers. As usual I was stalking every public account I could the entire night. Imagining all of the possible things he was doing. The next day one of his coworkers (a primary suspect) posted honestly a very intimate photo with my boyfriend. And by that I mean her face was pressed directly against his. From my previous research this woman is very touchy with her friends and frequently poses in photos hugging them very closely . Whatever - identifying if this photo proves cheating is not the point . 

The point is - since then I’ve had massive problems . My boyfriend did deny that anything happened between him and the woman and did not act any differently towards me despite the irritation from me interrogating him lol. Since then I’ve done nothing except continue to search for evidence and scrutinize every detail possible for signs of cheating . 

I can’t even last a few minutes on instagram without being triggered. And have it deactivated currently. 

I have stalked that woman in any way I can - save for going to find her in person. And I do it every day. Always wondering how I can be more like her to get my bfs attention. 

There is much more to say but I’ll sum it up. Basically I cannot stand these thoughts anymore . I look for evidence in everything I possibly can and it’s gone on for so long that I no longer know if I’m being delusional or not . My partner is unable to support me at this point because not only do his reassurances kind of mean nothing but he is getting very frustrated with my accusations (reasonably). He has not admitted guilt under any of my many questionings . 

The crazy part is that I don’t even care if he cheated or not anymore. I’d honestly understand if he did . But I don’t really want to know . I love him very much and am confident he loves me as well (even in the case that he made a mistake) so ending the relationship isn’t an option. 

I just want to enjoy my time with him and stop scrutinizing every action  detail  photo  whatever. I just want to accept the comfort my relationship can bring when I’m not undermining it . And I want to stop hurting myself and my partner. 


Edit: I was getting better around February but then experienced psychosis while smoking w33d . I was with my bf at the time and he said I was hallucinating  as I told him what I heard the next day and he said none of it happened. This psychosis was of course related to perceived cheating .

Things seem to have gotten worse since then ",4,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1jqt7jb/really_need_help_pathological_jealousy/
BPD,I need help understanding,"So before I say this I wanna say this has been not on purpose whatsoever. I have dated like 5 or 6 people with BPD  my current partner has BPD  my QPP has BPD  and a good chunk of my friends do too. I don't know how this happened  a friend suggested that it's because I may also have BPD but neither me nor my mom have seen any of the symptoms.

I feel bad;; because I don't know any BPD terms and when I look them up  they're all confusing. Whenever I ask I'm always met with an ""oh don't worry about it"" which isn't helpful? I've been told I'm someone's ""fp"" like a million times but from what I gather it's just like. a best friend?

BPD,I need help I am loosing my cat and can't cope,"Hello... I am writing this because I have no one to talk to... No one who understands... I am currently fighting for one of my cats life... The connection I never had with humans  I found in my cats. She has been with me since she was born - 17 years ago. She is with me half of my life. I have an incredibly deep bond with her. Because of her age I always tried to prepare  but now that it's happening it hit me like a truck. She's on the edge of death  still has spirit  still fighting. Just like me. But all the emotions are taking me down completely.

Currently I am having a training until Friday  and brought her to my mom. She takes good care of her but still every night is a sleepless night  waiting for a bad message. I want to visit her tomorrow  it's two hours away but worth it.

I am having heavy mental breakdowns daily. it just feels like my heart is ripping in pieces. My chest literally feels like exploding. I can't handle all these intense feelings  happening all at once. It's like a wave. I cannot stand  I just get blown away. I feel so  so helpless. I don't know what to do with my emotions. I can't even think of something else  I tried. I took a calming medication  but everything inside me is screaming. I just want to go home. But it looks bad for my job  I can't leave the training  I have three more cats I have to take care of financially.

I just feel so lost and sad I can't put it into words. And from my experience not many understand such intense feelings towards animals. Not many people understand it's not pets  but family. I feel pretty much alone with all these feelings.

how can i stop crying at literally everything? and why do i do this? the last thing i want to do is make him feel like im trying to manipulate him because i WANT to be in touch with his emotions it’s just hard because i don’t get very many opportunities to see his deep down emotions

BPD,Sexual attraction to people just because they were nice to me once. How common is this in BPD and why?,"I’m attracted to some unlikely and unexpected people.

He told me he wasn’t 100% about me because he cares a lot about sex and “I wasn’t like that”. We had sex multiple times before this  mind you  but it did take me a few weeks to be okay with it. I have never stopped thinking about that night. It broke me. 

So  I did what I had to do. I said yes out of guilt more often than not. There were times where I enjoyed it and initiated it  don’t get me wrong  but I said yes more than I was willing to. I was afraid he would leave if I didn’t; in fact  I knew he would. 

Now that we’re back together I’ve just started saying no more often and sticking to it. One night he was really drunk and I said no and he got mad at me  and he said “why don’t you ever think about what I want” 

It’s not like we never have sex. We do often  just not every day or the second I fucking wake up like he wants. I cried that whole night  but just shrugged it off because he was drunk. He’s started getting more and more frustrated with it. He told me a couple of weeks ago that it upsets him and whatnot  and no matter how much I tell him my reasoning (my sex drive isn’t as high  sometimes I don’t feel well or im tired  it usually just ends up hurting me  etc) and he just doesn’t get it and makes me feel so guilty.  He’s never “not” wanted it and has never said no  and the other night I tried to initiate it  even though I didn’t want it that much  I was trying to keep him happy. He said no and I was caught off guard  and he said “how do you think I feel”. That one hurt!! He’ll make comments about him masturbating and saying “I have to because you won’t.” Comments that lead into “I know we probably won’t have sex tonight”. It makes me feel so worthless and like I have nothing to offer. And again  it’s not like we don’t have sex. Maybe every 2 nights? 

Am i in the wrong? I feel so guilty and every night I start panicking at the thought of the conversation. I really hate myself for it. I know it will be the reason he leaves me again.",2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/poi908/constantly_feeling_guilty_for_not_wanting_sex/

BPD,DAE: Have bad mood swing and deep depression every night right before bed,"It seems that every night  right around the same time  I feel a shift in my mood. I could be really okay and just go to super fuck this I wanna die in an instant.  It's like loneliness and sadness on bath salts.

Here I sit  knowing that everything is alright  but the tears sit on the verge of ruining my make up.  Is it the dark of the night?  Is it bedtime? Is it knowing that all of my past relationships have been a joke?   That this past one might have been okay  if I had just learned not to talk about my BPD.  

Being mistreated because of my BPD make me feel like I am not good enough for anyone.  That the reason all my exs were psycho  is because no normal man could love me.  Sometimes  I wish I had stuck with the beatings  lies  cheating and drugging of my exs.  That way I could have a relationship longer than six months. 

How fucking stupid are these thoughts?  I would rather be abused than be alone right now.  Like I know that is fucking dumb as dog shit  but that's how I feel.  The urge to pick up the phone and beg for the man who threw my BPD in my face  to love me again is strong.  I want to ask him to forgive me for making the healthy choice and being alone.

Better yet  I could call a guy up for a hook up  but HIV is in my town and it's terrifying.  Like  I don't even want to kiss anyone before we get papers at the clinic together.  Part of me wants to go to a place where people will welcome me to hang.  But then my mind says  everyone there thinks you are a slut bag.  You only go there when you are single.  To look for love in the same cess pool of psychos.  

I don't know how to meet people.  If I do meet people they all hate me.  I'm rambling and crying now.  I should take a sleeping pill and just stop.",16,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/6erwnj/dae_have_bad_mood_swing_and_deep_depression_every/
BPD,are there any adults 30 and over with BPD?,"i’m 27 and i’ve been struggling with BPD since i was a teenager. does it get better?

i’m really losing hope for life. i told myself i wasn’t making it to 16 then 18 then 21  30… now i have a little sister who needs me more than anything and a fiance who would be devastated if i left.

i have no money  don’t have kids because im terrified of child birth  struggling to find something to eat by the time i go to sleep at night. i live in a mostly safe environment- a mental health rehabilitation program with my fiance who never leaves my side. i only say mostly because some effed up shit has happened to me in this program… 

can’t get someone to hire me  constant triggers  wrong therapy methods but can’t afford a good therapist  never traveled outside my area  can’t make friends even though my fiance is really trying his best to get me good friends but everyone is strung out where i am and deceiving.

i had a BPD episode that lasted a few days leading up to a meltdown today. 

i looked at my fiance and asked “if life doesn’t get any better  can i —— myself when i’m 40?” and i think he almost cried when he laid his head in my lap. 

it would give my siblings time to grow up and hopefully gain independence.

i know this is selfish which is why i want to ask- does life with BPD get better or is this it? is there any success or is it just relapse after relapse? 

i don’t want to leave anybody behind and i don’t want my siblings to go through that pain but i can’t stand it here. my only wish is to travel and i’ve never been outside of the city also have no money. that’s all i want. i feel like it would be therapeutic and make me see the beauty in life.

all i see in the city is addiction on every street and so many people suffering and just looking like they’re at the end of their life even when they’re not showing any gray in their hair. 

but like… i don’t see traveling ever happening. i don’t see a future job. really  can i have a good life with BPD? can i handle marriage? or is this it? 

edit: hey  thank you everyone for the amazing support. i’ve never gotten this kind of support or this amount of understanding for my BPD. i hope everyone can continue doing well.

it has given me some hope  im still scared for future emotions though. but at least i gained some hope.

i think i will join the subreddit because this community seems like one of the most helpful ones i’ve ever found.

BPD,some please please help me  how would you recover if you were in my shoes. I’m freaking the fuck out,"I really need advice from people who get it because I’ve reached an all time low and I’m terrified there’s no coming back from this level of pain and regret. 

Three months ago my boyfriend of three years broke up with me. Ever since then he’s tried to remain my friend because he still loved me at the time  but every single call and every single conversation we’ve had since has ended with me crying and begging him change his mind. Or I’d play it cool and try to mindgame it. either way  never once did I process or accept the reality that he could have changed his mind about me. I know now that he was something of a father figure in my mind and him giving up on me after years of living with me and nurturing me  like a father is a traumatizing loss. 

I actually have no idea how I even made it this far without being blocked for good but it all came to a head last night when I called him at 3 am sobbing telling him I needed him and I just didn’t underdtand. He got fucking enraged and started screaming about how he doesn’t love me anymore because no one has ever pushed him to this point in his life and I’ve given him not a single little thing to miss because of how hard I’ve been pushing. He kept telling me to leave him the fuck alone and realize that my life isn’t over and that he’s not the end of the world. He told me he can’t respect me anymore because of how I’ve acted like I can’t survive without him and that I’ve been downright scaring him. I was crying and begging him and shaking with actual terror asking him not to do this but he finally closed that last door and blocked me on everything. 

Well I fully spiraled. I made like dozens of textnow accounts texting and calling him and then I took my mom’s phone and my stepdad’s phone to call him and text him. fully losing my sanity. begging and pleading with him because I can’t lose him. I have never felt more goddamn low  out of control  suicidal  regretful  ashamed and embarrassed as I am now. There is no lower rock bottom than this and I don’t know how I’m going to come back from it. Knowing I completely drained every last remaining drop of love someone had for me because of my desperation and pushing of boundaries. In my heart I genuinely felt like I needed him to survive in that moment and there was no way for him to understand. He just fucking hates me now. 

I don’t know if I can ever rebuild my dignity or trust or love myself again for as long as I live with this terrifying need to never be alone. I cannot trust myself. I made an r4r post begging someone as lonely as me to just move me into their house and nurture me and take care of me so that I don’t have to sleep alone ever again. It’s so fucked up. I feel like there is literally no way I can get past this level of degeneracy and mental illness. It is over for me.

BPD,I want people to understand what BPD is actually like,"I get having a favourite person  disassociation  abandonment issues  no sense of identity etc... But in some ways  it’s so much more than just the nine or so symptoms in the DSM. That’s almost too simple. Someone just reading the DSM could never understanding exactly how far reaching and invasive this disorder actually is. 

I think my friends think I’m a bit lost and emotionally a bit manic. They think I’m a little highly strung  or simply hyper.  They think my existence is like the stereotypical manic pixie dream girl  a little troubled  but interesting. The extent of the mess is hidden  and I don’t know if I want them to know more. 

They don’t know about so many things.

How I had a meltdown the other night because I couldn’t braid my hair right at 12.30AM in the morning  cried and wanted to throw things like a child. 

The way I get so pent up on one emotion and too obsessed  overthinking to the point where I bite myself or grab the nearest sharp object to simply release some of this energy.

The paranoia. How actually  genuinely crazy I am. Thinking everyone hates me  is talking about me and then the extreme  like thinking cameras are in my room.

How suspicious I am of them  and how my opinion of them constantly changes. 

How I can love them so much one minute  then resent their existence the next.

How everything takes so much effort. How even focussing on one task takes so much energy  because my head never shuts the fuck up. 

To what extent I can’t enjoy basic socialising  because I disassociate  and have to go to the toilet to ground myself. 

How shaky my identity is. To the point that changing my clothes makes me feel like a different person. How can you know me  if I don’t?

How nowhere feels like home. Nowhere can be yours  if you are no one.

How I want to rage and scream and cry  and then laugh and shout with joy. And how quickly I flick.

How every piece of affirmation and compliment defines my short term personality and makes my day.

But also how every slight  perceived rejection makes me spiral and hate myself. 

How hard everyday activities are  because if they don’t go right  again I switch and spiral. 

I feel so much joy  but also so much sadness. So much of my energy is used just keeping the base of my life intact  but add any strains  and it cracks. Then all of a sudden I’m crying in my kitchen  accusing my best friend of hating me.

Sometimes I want to die  because I cannot cope. Sometimes I love life  because it’s amazing. But most of the time  I’m just exhausted from all of this.

I know it can get better  and I’m seeing a therapist and doing DBT. I eat well and exercise and put all my energy into keeping the axes of my life stable.  All of that leaves me drained  and then I fall into bed. 

And I cannot fucking sleep.

BPD,I fucking hate my life please tell me what I did was valid,"I met a guy through my ex-best friend while studying abroad. I had to come back to my hometown because studies didn't work out and before leaving  I confessed my crush  we kissed  and he was upset I didn’t tell him sooner.

After returning home  things got worse. I couldn’t see him  and he was terrible at texting. I started splitting on him until he had enough. Desperate to keep him in my life  I started paying him just to facetime and be a paid therapist (ik this is not how it works) but seeing him and talking to him and hearing what he got to say meant everything to me . I know it’s messed up  but I couldn’t help it.

As for my ex-friend  our friendship faded over time. She needed in-person interaction to maintain it  and when I needed her most  she was distant. Even when I saw her irl last things didn't feel right and she just was not there at all anytime I needed her. Ik as a bpd person I can be very needy and she's busy with her studies but were just talking about needing her 3 times a year and she wasn't there. But I didn't cut her off any sooner because she was great the first 3 years and the thought of cutting her off made me feel ungrateful and guilty. 

Yesterday  the guy told me that he told her about me paying him. That felt like a complete betrayal—he exposed something I was deeply ashamed of to someone I wasn’t ready to tell. That was my last straw. I removed her from everything. We hadn’t spoken in a year anyway  but this sealed it.

He was the love of my life and I let my resentment and my selfishness consume that and destroy both of our lives.

I was just supposed to be taking care of her while she recovered but I ended up cheating on him. I also did knife play with her convincing myself that kink didn’t count  even tho deep down I knew it would hurt him.

I knew I was hurting him. I saw all the pain he was going through and I didn’t stop. Every time he would tell me how bad I was  the impulse of living up to that monster in his head kept growing. I pushed and pushed and pushed till he broke and now I have burned down both of our lives to the ground. Why couldn’t I wait? I really wanted to start therapy in the new year and get better for him. Why couldn’t I just respect him and hold my impulses for a few more months? Why do I have to be like this. I hate myself so much and I hate that I poison every single thing I touch.

BPD,ex best friend / job anxiety attack chaos,"so buckle up here because this is a bit of a long one. 

so my ex best friend and i no longer speak  but they continue to come into the place i work at every day. this has been giving me horrible anxiety attacks and makes the rest of my shift absolute hell because i cannot stop shaking. 

now let me give you some back story. 
we haven’t spoken to each other in over a year at this point. before the “break up” happened we didn’t talk much besides kind of very not well communicated texts for the month leading up to this point which made things very rocky. we weren’t talking or hanging out so both of us were really just not doing well and not able to be there for each other. 
we had a couple small arguments over text abt stuff but did eventually hash it out in person (month before break up). however during this chat they didn’t apologize for any of the things i had brought that bothered me that we weren’t talking arguing about in the first place. 
(these things being them outing me by telling my coworker that i go by a different name  literally forcing me to out myself at work.)
after that conversation with no apology from them i had a lot of shit happen. 
i had to rehash texts from an old abuser to out them because they were spreading crazy rumors online about people i’m closely involved with within my music community. this person kind of started ruining my life with these rumors and i was very much on my breaking point. 
with all this happening i reached out to my friend for help because i really thought that was my final day alive. 
they didn’t respond to me but instead messaged my partner to get details on the situation and “access me”. all i needed was to talk to my friend about the shit going on and they instead messaged my partner back and forth for 40 minutes. so i got pissed off and basically said “fuck you” to them. 
the end result of this was them blocking me on every site imaginable and leaving me no way to reach to them. 

a little bit of time passes and then they started hanging out with the coworker they outed me to  even to the point of hanging out in the store after it was closed with many of my coworkers. 

now it’s been about 13 months since “break up” and those coworkers have moved away so they have no one left to be connected to at my job  yet they still come in every day while i’m working. 
about 3 weeks ago i left a note in their mailbox basically just saying that i was sorry and wanted the opportunity to apologize to them for what happened in person (bitch needs the closure). but i have no way of knowing if they even saw it because they haven’t said anything to me. 
i’m honestly over here losing my mind because the anxiety attacks i get when i see them tend to ruin my day with crazy thought spirals and dissociation. 
i’ve also been having nightmares that include them for the past year. they involve them attacking me  ignoring me  never being able to actually say what i want to them  and very bizarre  jarring situations. 

i also want to include that i have spent this past year in therapy and working on myself a lot so i feel i am in the proper place to explain myself and apologize for the things i said. 

TLDR: My ex best friend no contact blocked me after an argument  refuses to let me apologize even a year later  and still continues to come in to where i work every single day and it’s making me lose my mind. 

i’m considering leaving a much longer  well thought out letter  explaining the entire situation and including my apology so they may hopefully read it and be able to see where i’m coming from but i honestly just have no idea how to solve this situation because it’s consuming me.

This post isn't just to vent though  weird it feels good to have unmasked for a little while and show people that I do struggle with these things because they often did not believe me because in pretty good when it comes to my job.

BPD,Anxiety attacks,I(29f) was diagnosed a few months ago. While it's good to have a diagnosis and get therapy  it's still very hard to deal with. I have had panic attacks before  but they subside 20~30min. It's just gotten worse over time though  I have full blown anxiety attacks and they last a couple of hours. It's a very deabilitating  and tiring. It's getting so difficult to manage! I can think clearly when I'm feeling fine  but then the anxiety hits and it's unbearable. Most people don't see the full anxiety attack and assume I'm manipulating or looking for attention or I'm not doing enough. I'm so tired.

BPD,Waking up every morning with a panic attack,"Every morning since 3/4 years I wake up in a panic. feeling like i am about to die. The first thing I feel as soon as I open my eyes. It usually goes away in 20mins as I wake up and wash myself  walk outside etc. but every morning is just so full of dread  it's actual torture. 

How can someone wake up every single morning in a panic attack like that. Great way to kickstart the day. Plus I have super vivid intense dreams that feels like I'm traveling between alternate dimensions and it takes me a while to catch up with reality again. 

Sometimes I think if black magic curses would be real  this would be the closest thing to it. It feels like someone has put an evil curse on you  except that I've done nothing fucking wrong and I'm seriously the most naive and innocent person I know. Must have done something truly horrible in a past life when. I long for the day where I wake up and I'm feeling GOOD and refreshed and happy to open my eyes.

BPD,Does anyone know what is actually happening in our bodies during a panic attack?,"
what is actually happening in my body when I am having a panic attack / anxiety attack so severe I am physically shaking quite violently? Asking to help myself rewire my brain and recover from OCD and BPD.

I (31F) am actively in the process of working to get both severe OCD and also mild BPD into remission / recovery. Both developed from childhood abuse at the hands  emotions  and words of my biological father. He has not really been active in my life since 10  and abandoned our family to create a new one - this is happiest version of the story I can paint.

Good news - I am very close after 4+ years of trial and failure to being asymptomatic for OCD on the YCOBS scale. Meds and ERP work  and also suck  but are worth it. 

A week ago my treatment team shared that my relationship fears were not relationship OCD  but actually BPD. Thankfully I have a very mild case on the spectrum of this disorder  which has been enlightening  frustrating as I have been trying to heal since I was 12  and heartbreaking to realize my brain does not work like everyone else’s and the regret I feel of hurting potentially hurting others. 

 Due to unforeseen circumstances with a friend  I have jumped in the deep end of the pool facing these terrifying feelings. To try and keep this relationship  I have been simply accepting their terms  but this has left my anxiety and panic so horrific I am physically shaking quite intensely. Shaking so badly it’s like I was sitting on an uneven dryer or washing machine. 

It has since subsided  and me and the friend are healing and repairing  but working on a plan with my treatment team I am curious what happened in my body to cause this. I have heard of flooding with ERP for OCD and how that can cause setbacks instead of progress and was curious if this was the same or a similar reaction?

BPD,Panic attack over boyfriend not answering for over 12 hours,"I have a massive anxiety problem especially in relationships. I've also never had a good relationship except this one. Me and him have known eachother got 6 years and last year when he got home from the military we tried dating but with him just being home from the military it was just too much so we broke up which lead to me getting terrible depression. At the beginning of January we started talking again and ended up dating and things have been going good but I still have bad anxiety.

We send eachother random snapchats throughout the day just to keep in touch. Usually he answers within a couple minutes to an hour or so  but his work gets pretty busy on Mondays. So i didn't think much of it when he didn't texted me after he got to work yesterday. He hasn't texted me since and I can't stop crying. Im so anxious that something is wrong or that he's gonna leave me. I've double texted him and tried calling once but im scared to try again i dont wanna be a bother but im so scared. Sometimes he sleeps really deeply and I thought maybe his phone died at work and he went to bed when he got home but I can't stop crying and having panic attacks.

We also just spent the whole weekend together  I went to his house after work on Saturday and stayed until Monday (yesterday) morning and it was an amazing weekend spent with his family and him. But we still send cute little snapchats all the time just to keep in touch during the day. I miss him and im scared I know i shouldn't let relationships consume me but he's my best friend . We also just celebrated valentines and he got me a stuffed opossum which is my favorite animal.

Before we got back together I was in a really really bad place. I was extremely depressed and I came very close to doing something stupid . I've been having bad anxiety about the relationship because of all my previous ones and because of how this ended last time. Last time he also started a new job right after he got home from the marines which is part of the reason why we broke up. He's starting a new job now in a couple weeks so I've been very anxious about that.

BPD,Rage induced panic attack,"This is a i need tonget this iff my chest/vent post but i felt it more inportant to put the cw in the flair.

The other day I got home and the entire kitchen was rearranged. It threw me off and I immediately felt like vomiting. I also immediately got angry. I've never been so furious before. I went to my room and then couldn't breathe. I was pacing and grabbing/gripping my arms. I have never in my life felt the urge to grab the sharps and do damage to myself. Like  I'm a former cutter. But nothing compared to this. I ended up grabbing my sword and completely destroyed the TV in my room. It was bad. Luckily I was on the phone with my cousin and she got my attention and had me go take a shower. When I was in there hyperventilating she said ""Allright bitch you got 1 more minute of this and then you need to get it together."". And that helped. I took a sleep aid and passed out. I didn't want to feel anything anymore that night. Next day I felt awful. Not only did i destroy a perfectly good TV I also dinged my sword. I was and kind of still am so angry with myself for losing control like that. But I feel like the anger has been building. I've been angry and easily irritated for the past 2 or 3 months. Im so tired of being angry for stupid reasons. I often feel too tired to look for joy.

BPD,I miss you,"I just need to get this off my chest.

My sister (with BPD if that isn't clear) committed suicide October 3rd. 

I recently got into her computer (she definitely didn't want me getting into her accounts  but na na na boo boo 😝 <3).

I recovered pretty much her entire digital life. Emails  iMessages  therapy exercises  many correspondences with her therapist  her diary  etc.).

I'm her younger brother. I know she intentionally kept things from me  because *""[She didn't] want to burden people with [her] issues""*. My mother (sweetest mom in the world  basically the female Mr. Rogers) also kept things from me  because she *""didn't want to scare me""*. 

I was in the dark about a lot of things. I have a lot of guilt about this. I looked up the disorder online when she was diagnosed  but dude those textbook definitions and lists of symptoms did not help me fully appreciate what it's actually like living with the disorder. I should've talked to her more about it. I don't know if she wouldv'e really opened up if I did.  I have a lot of guilt about that.

I think that's why I wanted so badly to get into her computer. I wanted to know what it's like in her brain. 

Now like I said  I recovered incredibly personal and intimate information between her and her therapist  amongst other things. Things she never would have told us. I can understand why telling other people those things would be hard. But the more I learn  the **PROUDER** I am. Managing her disorder was a **full time fucking job**. And she was diligent and responsible about it  she did everything you're supposed to do. She studied neuroscience and was taking the MCAT (or some acronym related to pre-med). She had folders of coping mechanisms  BPD workbooks  catalogs of quotes from her therapist  all color coded and organized  again a full time job basically. She was actively working hard everyday  just to exist. And from the outside looking in  she seemed to be managing. I hate how oblivious I was. 

She was a fucking SUPER HERO. I saw a post on the front page that I couldn't agree more with. If you put her brain in me for a single day  there's no way I'd last anywhere near as long as she did. 

It breaks my heart unbearably knowing what she was dealing with. She just had shit fucking luck. Her brain was broken and everyone told her to do this and do that  and she did  for decades  and honestly I feel she had every right to end it. I don't know if that's dangerous to say  but I know I don't want her just suffering through life.

I'm kind of spiraling now I just love you Sirena and I miss you so much and I'm so so fucking proud of you. I've never felt anything even close to this level of emotional pain  and it's not even close to what you were dealing with every fucking day.

BPD,To the Girl with BPD Who Feels like a Monster,"To the girl with BPD who is labeled as a bad person & feels like a monster -

I see you. I am you. I know how guilty you feel for the way you act and speak to the ones you love the most  and I know that it’s a never-ending cycle. No matter how hard you try  your mental illness is just a dark cloud drifting over you at all times. You sabotage your happiness. You run away from anyone who treats you decently. You’ve found too much comfort in misery that happiness doesn’t feel right. You don’t feel deserving of a life that isn’t filled with uncertainty. 

Everyone can see the angry actions and the venom that leaves your tongue. They can see the insecurity in your bones. They can see that you have no ability to trust. They see that you have a heightened response to the smallest of things. They see the things that you do  but they don’t  and will never  see the things that you feel. They’ll never understand the constant battle in your head. They’ll never understand that you didn’t ever want to be this person. They’ll never comprehend that you are left to deal with experiences that you should never have had to have. 

You can be made out to be a monster rather easily. After all  anyone can see that your actions are wrong  right? But your BPD doesn’t care. Your BPD doesn’t consider what YOU want. It doesn’t care how others will view you based on the actions & responses that your BPD has instilled in you. Your BPD tries  and often succeeds  to sabotage your life in irreparable ways. BPD never truly considers the person we are under the symptoms  the things WE want  the things we don't want to feel. Having BPD is not a choice & you would do anything to get rid of it. 

You are not a bad person. You are left to deal with the pain  guilt  trauma  and anger from the experiences that caused you to have this incurable mental illness. From the outside  you may look like a normal person. But no one ever digs deep enough to see you for the true you. The BPD has cast a shell over the true you  and this shell is what others see. 

It may feel that you are labeled as the bad guy in nearly every situation  but try your best to remember that nearly no one that feels this way about you understands or sees your mental illness. You are doing your best. You are taking the absolutely awful circumstances and cards you were dealt  and trying your hardest to live daily life without losing your grip on it all. 

You are worthy. You are a good person. Your BPD does not make you into a monster. One day  you will find someone that sees you exactly for the person that you are under all the symptoms. They will see the small glimpses of you that are not altered or controlled by BPD  and they will see the utter light that you are & how much effort it takes to get through a “normal” day in your life. 

So keep going. Give a middle finger to the ones that see you for nothing more than your symptoms  the ones that don’t care to look past the shell and see YOU. You were never asked to deal with these circumstances  but here you are - doing it. 🤍

BPD,When DBT Didn't Work: How IFS Helped Me Heal My BPD Differently ,"I was diagnosed with BPD in 2020 and started DBT-PE (Dialectical Behavior Therapy with Prolonged Exposure) along with a DBT group. According to current understanding  BPD develops as a response to traumatic invalidation - when our emotional experiences are consistently denied  dismissed  or punished  especially by caregivers during crucial developmental periods.

When we experience repeated invalidation  our nervous system develops protective responses. These aren't random ""symptoms"" - they're exactly what we needed to survive. Our anger protected us from being taken advantage of. Our intense reactions made sure our needs couldn't be ignored. Our fear of abandonment kept us vigilant and safe from rejection.

The fundamental issue I found with DBT is that it operates within the DSM model  viewing these responses as symptoms of a disorder that need to be corrected. While well-intentioned  this approach can inadvertently repeat the pattern of invalidation. When we frame our emotional responses and protective behaviors as ""symptoms"" that need to be corrected  we're essentially telling these parts of ourselves that they're wrong or dysfunctional.

My experience with DBT-PE was invalidating to these parts. I was only to use DBT skills to ""expose"" myself to triggering situations. When I ended up quitting therapy and the DBT group  I thought there was something wrong with me. That if only I picked myself up by my bootstraps and tried harder  did my ""homework "" filled out my diary cards and really ""did the work "" I could heal myself.

I still got into conflict with my invalidating family and believed it was because I wasn't ""doing the work."" But now I see that DBT-PE wasn't effective because it was trying to change the parts that had kept me alive this long without their acknowledgment or permission.

Internal Family Systems (IFS) offers a radically different perspective. Instead of viewing our behaviors as symptoms to be corrected  IFS sees them as protective parts that developed to help us survive. These parts aren't broken - they're doing exactly what they learned to do to keep us safe. When we experience intense emotions or engage in self-destructive behaviors  these aren't ""BPD symptoms"" to be managed away. They're protective responses from parts of ourselves carrying deep pain and trauma.

My experience with IFS has been gentle and non-invasive. It feels respectful of exactly where I am  and I'm not forced to change anything I'm not ready to change. This lets all parts of myself feel safe  seen  and understood.

I'm not saying DBT doesn't work for some people - acceptance is part of the dialectic in DBT. I know that DBT's approach is built on both acceptance and change. What makes IFS unique is its perspective that these parts we often want to change are actually trying to help us. We start with pure curiosity about these parts and build relationships with them. Any change emerges organically from understanding  rather than being the goal from the start.

I know DBT is considered the gold standard for BPD  providing concrete skills that help many people manage overwhelming emotions and build stable relationships. But for those of us who've tried DBT and felt like failures  I want you to know there are other paths.

My relationship with myself and my parts  though I've just started IFS  is slowly transforming. For most of my life  I wanted to get rid of parts of myself I hated. Now I see these parts have always been trying to help me  even if in destructive ways. This shift in perspective has helped me develop real compassion towards myself - a huge change in how I've related to myself for most of my life.

If you're feeling like the one person DBT isn't working for  you're not alone. Your struggle isn't because you're not trying hard enough. Maybe  like me  you need an approach that starts with genuine acceptance of all your parts before any change can happen. There's nothing wrong with needing a different path to healing.",274,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1gcsgc0/when_dbt_didnt_work_how_ifs_helped_me_heal_my_bpd/
BPD,5 years of pain and suffering that I just want to end: remind me when it will get better again?,"5 years that I’ve been suicidal  pretty much daily 
3 residential treatments  a number of acute treatments and 72 hour holds  roughly 10 attempts starting at age 12  4+ ER stays  self harm urges that won’t go away  years of trauma that I don’t think I’ll ever recover from. Ketamine infusions  therapy since the age of six  30+ medications  so many medical treatments  the death of my twin sister  thousands of hours of research  chronic illnesses  a disability  online school because I can’t function in regular school  people who don’t understand  and never will  and so much more. 

So tell me  when exactly will this pain and suffering end? I’ve tried everything  and more and more trauma gets piled on me frequently. I’m sick of this  I hate it. I don’t want to be here  and I haven’t for a long time. I’m sick of people saying “stay strong  have hope  it’ll get better.” It’s easy for them to say that when they aren’t feeling this way. I get it  that there will be good times in life  but I don’t know that they’ll ever out way the bad. My friends are going to school  doing sports and activities  going on dates  hanging out  etc. Some kids my age are even becoming parents. Yet me  I can’t manage to cook for myself  I can’t fully do the hygiene regimen I should  I’m so fatigued I can barely exercise...

BPD,Flaky friend triggered something very painful in me. It reminded me of what a sore loser I am and how no one wants to hang out with me. I have no friends and this cruel just toying with me because she has not figured out after years how to end the friendship with me.,"Lol how pathetic she is!!!! My goodness i just spend 20 minutes crying and crying my eyes out. A flaky ex 'friend' from highschool returns yet again in my life with her fake 'Omg i miss you girl i think about you all the time  we need to hang out soon'. She has been doing these for years  claiming she misses me then dips out whenever i tell her i am free. If i tell her when im free and free to talk on the phone  she makes excuses after excuses ""Oh i may have to study' 'i work until midnight' ' i will deff call u when i leave class'. Guess what it never happens. Why does she do this???? Why??? If she dont wanna talk or hang out then dont text me at all or say anything how is that hard???? 

This shit happened again. This shit been happening for years. My mom gave her my number without my permission for the 4th damn time because she goes to the store sometimes where she works and says hi to her when she see her. 

 I see her text a few days ago 'Hi omg miss u girl i think about u all the time''. OKAY.  sure you do. Rolled my eyes and almost laughed. and ''when you free  i def wanna hang out with you'' and then makes excuses again when i offered to talk on the phone 'll def call you when i get out of class' despite telling my mom  that she graduated college  she lying to me saying she still in school to avoid talking and hanging out with me. That hurt me so much   I am that lame ??? she even discouraged me from applying to her job despite telling my mom she would help me saying it 'too much'' as if i cant handle it'' bitch dont worry i dont wanna work with you either.

 She is so disgusting and cruel  WHAT IS THE POINT! of making plans with me and pretended to be still be invested in the friendship and hurt me like this!!!! Just fkin tell me you do not want to be friends!!!! i dont wanna be friends with you either!!! i actually told her and how pathetic how at many lies she told me just to not talk to me  and I blocked her  and i FELT SO GOOD letting it all out!!!

Fuck you KIMBERLY!!!!


I still feel like shit too. I feel like an ugly loser that no one wants. I have NO friends.  I ended things with a childhood friend who was toxic  and i REGRET IT. I regret it soo much now  she probably felt how i was feeling now when we broke off :( im so sorry  i hate how i let my emotions take over me!!!! This shit hurts  i miss having friends :( i will no have no friends to laugh with  to share good moments  no friends to attend my wedding (if a guy is crazy enough to marry me)  to go to dinner :( :( i am all alone. This loneliness makes me want to die!!!

I cried and cried  i got flashbacks of rejection and abandonment  i cried because this shows me i am loser that no one wants to hang out with!! Why does it hurt?? i dont want to be her friend either  yet i still feel a lot of pain that someone would go through many hoops just to avoid me hahaha  how can i make this pain go away?? :/",21,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/r3ohh7/flaky_friend_triggered_something_very_painful_in/
BPD,Hurting people is not a symptom of BPD.,"I’m a little concerned about some of the posts I’m reading on here. I understand that we are a group of hurt individuals but I feel a sense of responsibility to hold myself to a standard after the diagnosis. I try not to use it as an excuse for my behavior. 


There are things about this disorder that no one will understand. No one. But  as we all know  we are not the same as the other Cluster B disorders. We feel guilt and are able to analyze ourselves critically (albeit we have a tendency to go too far with it). Reading that “leading people on for fun and then hating them” is a symptom of the disorder and seeing so many upvotes on it is so disheartening. I live most of my life shying away from explaining the mental constraints that abandonment and abuse have left me with because people lump us in with psychopaths and narcissists. 


We’re not. We are accountable for what we have done. And more importantly  we are accountable for what we do today. I don’t mean that in a negative way; see it positively. Don’t go too heavy on the guilt and self hatred; just accept that you struggle with something and do your best today. Hurting people is NOT a symptom of BPD. It does NOT give you the entitlement to expect people to put up with nonsense. It IS an unfair hurdle that we have to overcome but life is unfair. 


I’m not sitting on a high horse here- I make mistakes all of the time; I’ve made some today. I might tomorrow. But I am NEVER going to say that hurting someone or doing something wrong is because of my mental challenges. My mistakes are my cross to bear. Please don’t tell yourself that these are “symptoms”. The pain we feel and the tendencies to overcome that pain are symptoms. Involving other people with pain is NOT. 



I don’t want to come across as insensitive at all; I understand the nagging guilt and shame. I understand the emptiness. I understand the suffering. I struggle daily not to let my pain leak out onto those around me (mostly the urge to end my life or tell my friends all about how much I want to end my life) because it can be so overwhelming at times and I am not perfect. And I understand  trust me  that when you lash out you are only trying to protect yourself and the pain you feel from the event is ten times worse than anyone you lashed out against. 



I  and we  are only human. We make mistakes. The first step is to acknowledge that we are responsible for any pain we cause. 



So please do not say that hurting people is a symptom of BPD. It simply is not.

BPD,I got told I don’t meet the criteria for BPD anymore. I want to share how I did it.,"Hi everyone! This is my first post ever. 

I’m just going to dive right in. I was diagnosed in 2014 when I was about to turn 20. I’m 25 now  so this was a fairly long process. 

The mental health system is shit. I was simply told my diagnosis and sent on my way. No further input  just years on waiting lists. I decided “fuck it”  and I decided to develop my own recovery plan. 

I read the list of symptoms and I took a note of them. For a whole month  I kept a log of my symptoms. 

What symptom occurred? What triggered it? How did you respond? How did affect the other person? How did your response affect you? How can you respond better next time? 

I noticed I had 3 major symptoms that occurred more frequently than others. 

Fear of abandonment.
Unstable relationships.
Unclear sense of self. 

I decided these were the most important symptoms to tackle. My fear of abandonment was intense to the point I would physically grab a person and beg them to stay  threatening to harm myself. It was manipulative  but it was a knee-jerk reaction. 

I read about the symptom and managed to identify what caused it. My dad was unreliable and was in and out of my life like a yo-yo for the first 6 years. He stayed and never left after that  but the damage was done. So - I had to tackle it. 

I researched about effective communication and planned how I would talk to my Dad about how he hurt me and to figure out if I could understand why and let the pain go. 

I wrote a short script and then asked my Dad if we could talk. It was something like  “Dad  I know this is a difficult subject  but I’d like it if we can just clear the air. I want to understand why you left me so many times as a young child so we both can move forward.”

I didn’t get my answer  because he didn’t have one himself - he didn’t understand his own reasons. I decided that if I wanted to continue a positive relationship with my Dad  I had to learn to accept this. 

So I researched acceptance. I then wrote in my log every time I struggled to accept something  and thought about ways I could come to terms with things. I learned acceptance is not the same as forgiveness. Acceptance means “it happened  I feel this way  I can’t change it; but I can move forward from it.” 

Acceptance has nothing to do with forgiving the other person - it does have everything to do with holding them accountable. 

After this  I decided the only way to get over my Fear of Abandonment was to physically stop myself. Whenever I felt that horrid  bubbling feeling - I sat on my hands. I bit my tongue. I forced myself to *let people leave*. It was so fucking hard. But I had made a promise to myself that I wanted to get better. So when they left  I turned my phone off. I turned my attention to punching my pillows  singing my heart out  cleaning up. Anything that prevented me from 1. hurting myself. 2. manipulating or guilt tripping another person. 

Eventually  my fear began to fade away. It’s been two years since my last episode. I have finally gotten to the point that if someone threatens to leave me in a petty argument  I simply wave and say “goodbye  then.” If they’re serious  I will offer ways to resolve the issue - if that doesn’t work  I don’t beg. I just say “ok” and leave it at that. 

Because I had researched communication  I began logging about my interactions with others. I wanted to see how much I could remember about the conversations I was having with people and what I could remember about the people I was having them with. Such as: What was their kids name? Their partners name? What is their profession? Did they mention anything interesting you want to know more about? 

Combining the research on communication and making myself remember things about another person made the next time we conversed immensely easier and more comfortable. 

This also improved my existing relationships tenfold and I began researching about healthy relationships. I noticed that some of my relationships were toxic and draining  but I had glossed over them. I used my communication research and tried to fix the relationships that were a little battered  but most of them faded away naturally as I got stronger. 

Because I knew how to tolerate/beat my fear of abandonment  I was totally OK with what would have usually felt like a massive loss. I didn’t feel like I lost anything at all. 

My self-esteem began to rise. I began to feel more confident and independent. 

Eventually  all my other symptoms slowly started to fade. 

Now  I did go to DBT in November 2018 and the techniques I learned in there really just propelled me to the end of my recovery. There’s also an amazing book “The Dialectical Behaviour Therapy Skills Work Book” that helps me stay on top of things. 

I was told in June 2019 that I no longer meet the criteria. Despite that  I am rejoining that DBT group in the New Year. 

It’s possible to recover. Marsha Linehan did. She says if she can do it  anyone can and I believe her. 

I know BPD feels like a Hell hole but no matter how cliché this is  it can get better. 

It was by no means easy and it took me 5 years and hundreds (no exaggeration) of relapses. This is only a snippet of my journey  but I hope it’s a snippet that inspires/helps you on your own journey.

I just want this pain to end. Skills didn't help (I can skill all time and gain no benefit). Act against the feeling didn't help.

BPD,I just want to make the pain stop. I want the feelings of worthlessness to go away forever. I want to know it gets better.,"I've been crying off and on for 2 days now. I have been suffering from mental illness since childhood  and BPD specifically for almost a decade. I am 26 now with 0 hope for the future. If I feel rejected from someone I care about  my entire inner world crumbles and I feel like dying is my only option. I know I'm being irrational  but when the emotions are so extreme and I literally can't catch my breath for a moment  I don't know what else to do. I left my home town 2 years ago because everyone and everything there was contributing to my mental state. I love both my parents  and am close with them both  we can even joke about my BPD and I let them know when it comes up that they aren't innocent in all this. However  the idea of living with either of them sounds awful  as I know they don't really understand what it's like living with this level internal pain when it does come up. They are the easiest people to split on  and I know if we get too close  I will despise them again. Like I said  I love them  but do blame them (and others) for this awful illness. This illness is NOT my fault and I refuse to believe that. I am in active therapy that's going well  but I recently ended things with my partner (aka the only person who makes me feel understood) and I now feel like I have no one. Like  I have friends and know people love me....I unfortunately don't love me therefore it doesn't matter for shit if they love me  I can't feel it. I don't have any friends that I actively hangout with since I don't know how to make friends in a new state especially during a pandemic. My ""best friend"" thinks I am this way cus my partner and by leaving him  things will get better. Well  I left him  found a new living situation with 2 women  and have an out. But now  I feel like this is the completely wrong thing to do. I don't wanna share a space with 2 strangers and have to explain to them my mental illnesses. I don't want to put that stress on them or be paranoid that they don't like me or have to deal with anything. Truth is I can barely function when I am alone  I'm just super fucking good at convincing others I'm good. People don't know I'm suffering the way I am because I am illusive when I'm in a bad state and people don't see it and if I am hanging out with someone  it's so much work to tell myself the whole time "" you're not doing anything wrong/you're likeable/this is fun/ect"" and I appear to be fine. I don't talk or see people when I'm not good  so people don't know what's going on. It sucks when I tell someone my shit and their response is ""you don't like like someone with BPD or Bipolar Disorder"" like no fucking shit  and it makes me wonder .....am I making this up? Is my mental illness even real? Even though I have been toggling the mania and depression for years  and when I think I'm being abandoned I literally become a puddle and hate myself. I just want to know this gets better. I want to fucking trust myself and know how to make decisions for me. I am tired of my self worth being in the hands of everyone else. I just wanna be okay and I'm not. I can hang on for today  but I don't know when eventually I'm going to snap.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/jtumq3/i_just_want_to_make_the_pain_stop_i_want_the/

BPD,bf said im a 7/10,"hi all first post here

nobody i know can really understand how i feel and why it makes me feel terrible 

me and my boyfriend were calling and i explained to him how i rate things and people differently than most

he asked what i would be on my scale

he is genuinely the only man i’ve been so physically attracted to  so i told him so. i told him how on my scale  and in my opinion  he would be a perfect 10/10.

i told him what i thought i was

i’m not extremely unattractive nor attractive  so i stated that i think i’m a good 5-5.5/10 on my own scale.

i didn’t ask him to rate me because i had gotten hints of him not thinking i’m as attractive as i find him  just from little conversations 

but out of nowhere he said   “you’re like a 7/10” 

i didn’t hear him well  and asked him what he said

he said nothing and attempted to move on a few times (which makes me feel so much worse oh my goodness)

i asked him enough for him to feel annoyed and to tell me that to him i’m a 7/10  and that i have lots of room to grow. 

i tried to play it off; i really did

i had to leave that call before i began sobbing

i told a friend about it and they said i was overreacting but i’m honestly so fucking hurt i have never hated my appearance more  but it feels like i’m overreacting which only makes things worse",317,255,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1eh52o5/bf_said_im_a_710/

I recently graduated from an accelerated nursing program and while in the program I noticed that symptoms I didn’t really notice before or had difficulty managing  came to surface and since graduating things have definitely intensified to the point where I’m like yeah.. okay..

Why do I care so much about whether people like me and why do I want to fight everyone who DOESNT like me lol?!

BPD,Please help  I may fuck my relationship ,"I love my husband  we have 2 kids together (maybe not the best decision for me especially  but I love them and most of the time I'm happy to have them)  we are together for 10 years  since I was 17 and he was 19. We grew together  in every single aspect of our life and I don't want to end things  like I really do want to spend the rest of our life together.  

The thing is  earlier this year (January) we had this huge fight over my insecurity and his behavior with a female workmate where I thought he was having feelings for her (it wasn't the case  I did a post detailed about this) I had a huge trigger and in March I was hospitalized in a mental health hospital for 15 days.  

The thing is  I was barely able to talk to him during call time  because the phone in the rooms wasn't working  and the infirmary was always full of people wanting to call/get called.  

I got pretty close with some patients  some I talk even today  we bonded really close and I love her  and other I did find nice to have their company but it wasn't really my cup of tea outside.  

But I made a fucking huge mistake  there was this guy  and he was really my type  and cute  and idfk I was attracted to him  but I would never cheat. So we chatted and I felt attracted to him  and things were supposed to end there  I did flirt a little bit I think it was so subtle that nobody noticed  not even him.  

Anyways  cut to now  I do follow him on Instagram  and I still have this lingering attraction to him  and it's not sentimentality it's just like magnetically  it's crazy but it's not like I want to fuck him or marry him  it's like just kissing like a fucking teen.  

I send him a dm using a Instagram account that I don't use (was gonna use for professional stuff  but gave up the idea) and I don't knowwwwww I think I'm fucking things up  but it's been so long since I have felt this way  like when we are innocent or almost innocent and flirted and that was it yk? Just some random shit.  

Idk  I know I'm fucking things real bad  idk what I'm doing  I would like to blame BPD but honestly is it fault tho? Or am I just fucked up?  

Edit: Not that it matters for most here  but some people really tried to help somewhat  and some really did comment things in a way that makes here looks like a place where people know that everyone here is struggling psychologically.  

I talked to my husband  we have reached some conclusions about why I'm feeling this way  I won't be sharing any of it here after everything said in comments. He doesn't think of it as a cheat  and he understands where it came from. We have been together for 10 years  and through more than enough problems  he knows who I'm and knows I would never do anything to hurt him purposely.  

For those who told me to block him  I already had done that right after I posted  I was really just trying to figure out why I was feeling that way after months of no contact with the other guy.  

For all the other ones  yes  I'm fucked up  so are all of you who fucked any relationship with people you loved over a argument  something bad you said knowing it would hurt the other  for those who ruined friendship over splitting and everything else. I NEVER cheated on him  the ""flirting"" was as small as smiling and sitting together in a fucking hospital  nothing was ever said  nothing was ever done  nor emotion was involved  people are attractive get over it  you can think people are attractive even when you are in a relationship  you can't act on it.  
""Oh but you message him"" yes  I said ""hey  your annonimously question box link isn't working  how can I say something?"" In another Instagram so he doesn't know who the fuck I am because I don't plan on going down this  I don't even know what I would ask  honestly.  

Anyway  that's it for everything  thanks most of you for nothing but aggravating my mental health (if you know all of us here gets suicidal  and self-harming  you should just not talk this shitty way with people you don't fucking know where stands on their mental health  specially after they said they had to be admitted in a fucking hospital  I may be fucked up  and all other shit you said about me  I get it  I acknowledge it  I will be with me all the things you guys said for a long time every time I get worse  but you guys should know that you are all a bunch of assholes as well).",0,91,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1hl0r9u/please_help_i_may_fuck_my_relationship/
BPD,Lost my dear boyfriend of 5 years to suicide 2 weeks after starting lexapro,"I’m sorry for long post and bad grammar. But I really hope I can exchange stories with someone in a similar situation  or help someone.

My boyfriend had a really rough childhood  a mom who moved and got new boyfriends all the time (10+ stepfathers through the years) + had alcohol problems  him and his sister had to find her on the street and put her to bed etc - she was also violent. His grandparents were also alcoholics  and there was some serious generational trauma going on there. The father was never there  only bought things and was super materialistic. He had contact with his toxic family on and off until he was 30. When we met  he really struggled with fear of abandonment and trust  he was just done with his physiotherapist degree and had worked really hard to build up a good customer base. Then Covid came and took away everything that he built up because physical contact was not allowed. Then he tried to commit suicide 3 years ago  and got diagnosed with BPD after a long hospital stay. After that he cut all contact with his family after they tried to deny his diagnosis (since BPD often is triggered through childhood trauma  and that meant they had something to do with it) - and we started a life together without them. We bought a dog and moved to a new apartment to start over  I tried to give him all the security and love on earth as I loved him with all my heart - and show him how wonderful and capable he really was. We became very close  partners in crime  and he slowly got rid of his fear of abandonment with me. It was the most beautiful thing. 

For the last 3 years his fears was more fixated on achievements within career  he really wanted to be successful and always set very high expectations for himself. He wanted more stability in life than working as a private physiotherapist commission based - and got a good job offer within insurance with a really good salary. I have never seen him so happy  and he was absolutely nailing the job. He worked there for almost 1 year. He was going through examinations to get a certificate as insurance advisor - he nailed the 5/6 on the first try. He got really good friends there  and got a super understanding boss. Then as the last exam was coming up that was the hardest one that nobody on his team had completed even  he failed 2 times. As it was building up to the last try  he suddenly got extreme anxiety attacks and couldn’t sleep for 2 weeks. We postponed the exam to next year and his boss said that everyone was postponing  but the anxiety wouldn’t go away. We went to his doctor  and he prescribed lexapro and oxazepam. I stayed home with him from work for 2 weeks and he had this growing fear that he would never be able to go back to work  and that he would loose everything again. He was first started on 10mg lexapro  then after the 2 weeks 20mg. I was really scared as I read about the side effects  and he said that he was having passive suicidal thoughts to his doctor - and was really afraid when the anxiety was crawling in. But that things were ok when he was taking the sedatives. My boyfriend told me that this was the last thing he wanted  and that he prayed to god that the ssris would help him out of this. Suddenly he told me he was afraid he would hurt himself  as if he didn’t have control over his thoughts when the anxiety was at its worst. The doctor told him to just be patient and to use the sedatives until the ssris started working  and that he should just feel better. He didn’t mention any of the side effects  we had to read that on our own. My boyfriend asked if it was safe to do that increase so fast  and asked all sorts of questions to know that it was safe since he had attempted 3 years ago. My boyfriend was hopeful. The day after the dose was upped to 20mg  he hung himself. No note  nothing. And I know he didn’t want to die - he was scared and thought he just had to follow the doctors instructions. 3 weeks before this he booked a summer vacation for us next year  and we planned the Christmas holidays. It feels like the ssris hijacked his brain and took him. 

I’m in shock and absolutely devastated   I don’t even know what to say or how to move on with my life without him. We fought so hard during those 5 years  and never saw this coming as everything in his life had never been going so well. We have been through tougher times that could have triggered him. I understand he was prone to get anxiety under pressure  so I guess maybe thats what startet the downwards spiral.. But the suicidal thoughts didn’t start before the ssris  and the anxiety was just different. After talking to several other doctors  they all say it’s absolutely crazy to increase the dosage with ssris so fast when someone has previous suicide attempts - especially unsupervised! I don’t know how the meds affect people with BPD either - but it sure didn’t seem like it was a good plan to start him on those meds during a meltdown. They made it even worse. Only psychiatrists that know both psychology AND medicine should be allowed to prescribe these meds. Please be careful  and trust your own instincts if something feels off when starting meds! 

Please share with me if you have experienced suicidal thoughts on ssris  or have lost someone to suicide who went on ssris. Especially those who have BPD. We have to share experiences to bring awareness ",187,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1h7baph/lost_my_dear_boyfriend_of_5_years_to_suicide_2/

BPD,Does anyone else feel like they’re losing their intelligence?,"When I(23f) was younger  I was told how smart I was. How I always wanted to read and learn about everything at a young age. Grades were top tier and all. 

But now  its like I cant remember important things I’m supposed to know. I can recognize certain words and when I was younger  I used to use them in an everyday setting. I could have smart conversations with my mom. Now  when someone says a ‘big’ word  I’m lost on its meaning. When I’m having a conversation with someone  I cant use ‘big’ words because I simply cannot remember them. 

Its hard knowing how sharp and precise I was and how sure I was about my life. Now I feel like I cant even do simple things for myself without having someone there to guide me. Feel like when I’m speaking to someone  I cant remember words let alone concentrate on what they’re saying. I didn’t use to require help. 

I’m not even sure if I can gain that independence again to be honest. That confidence in myself to be sure of myself seems like it has dwindled. I would forget ordering online is a thing. Or that I don’t always have to buy cheap things for myself. Or i just would forget going out to see a movie w someone. 

Been told I ‘act just like a blonde’. It hurts knowing people think im dumb or cant understand the situation. I rarely get told I’m smart anymore by anyone. Even my own bf doesn’t say it. When I would pull out a few ‘big’ words from my memory  he would say in a condescending tone  ‘oh you’re using big words today’. I was very good at english. It was my favorite subject in school. Why cant I english anymore?  

But I know deep down I’m very smart. I know what I can do. I know to what extent that i can understand. Im too scared to tell someone that I don’t understand for fear of being called stupid. Nobody takes me serious and they always doubt my abilities. 

I’m trying workbooks and brain teasers but i cant get it back. I cant get myself back. Ive lost my intelligence. From street smarts to book smarts. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m sorry this is all jumbled. I hope y’all can understand it. Any advice is welcome.",477,75,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/12bp5bl/does_anyone_else_feel_like_theyre_losing_their/

BPD,I just split with a friend and blocked him. I feel like trash  so I asked ChatGPT for insight instead of tricks. Holy shtt  it clicked now! I’ll fix and understand myself better from now on. Splitting is a defense mechanism and how my brain thinks to survive  it's very distorted!,"Here is what chatgpt says:

1. **Splitting is an emotional survival tool  not reality** – It helps you cope but distorts the truth.
2. **Your emotions are real  but they don’t define facts** – Strong feelings can mislead you.
3. **Fear of abandonment makes everything feel urgent** – But reacting too quickly can push people away.
4. **People are not all good or all bad** – Even those who hurt you have positive qualities.
5. **Your perception changes with your mood** – Wait before making conclusions.
6. **Ambiguity feels unsafe  but it’s normal** – Not everything needs a definite answer.
7. **Your brain craves control to avoid pain** – Accepting uncertainty reduces splitting.
8. **Rejection is painful  but it doesn’t erase past care** – Love isn’t invalidated by conflict.
9. **Anger and love can exist at the same time** – Feeling hurt doesn’t mean the relationship is doomed.
10. **Disagreement is not abandonment** – Someone can challenge you and still care deeply.
11. **Your inner child fears being left behind** – But you are not that child anymore; you can self-soothe.
12. **Splitting damages trust** – It creates cycles of pushing people away and feeling abandoned.
13. **You’re not a burden for struggling** – People who care about you want to understand.
14. **The urge to split often comes from past wounds  not present actions** – Pause and reflect.
15. **Not everyone will meet your emotional needs perfectly** – And that’s okay.
16. **Your value doesn’t change based on others’ actions** – You are worthy  even when relationships feel unstable.
17. **Self-compassion reduces the need for extremes** – When you accept yourself  you don’t need to categorize others harshly.
18. **You can tolerate emotional discomfort without acting on it** – Feelings pass if you let them.
19. **Healing doesn’t mean never splitting again** – It means recognizing it faster and responding with awareness.
20. **You have the power to rewrite your patterns** – Every time you pause instead of reacting  you grow.",145,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1if50am/i_just_split_with_a_friend_and_blocked_him_i_feel/

BPD,I can’t let go of anger. I feel like a psychopath. ,"I can’t let of anger. I feel like a psychopath

. 

Posted on a throwaway for obvious reasons. 

My ex cheated on me after a very long term relationship and then left me  and didn’t look back. He was so cruel about the entire thing and lacked any sort of compassion  despite him being the one that hurt me. 

I was once a happy  kind  gentle person and now I am no less than evil. This heartbreak and betrayal has changed me in ways I didn’t think were possible. I don’t feel happiness anymore. Christmas is around the corner  and last year I would’ve had the decorations up by the end of November  bought gifts  watched movies etc anything to be in the Christmas spirit. This year it feels like a burden. I think about my past self who loved these things and that person feels so far away. Like I’m in this car that’s driving away from her  and I look out the window to steal glances and feel nothing. I just feel sadness  rage and numb. 

I don’t like hurting people. I couldn’t hurt people. I feel like crying whenever somebody around me accidentally hurts themselves etc bites their tongue or stubs their toe. It hurts me deeply. But when I think of my ex  I want him to hurt so badly. Despite feeling unhappiness  I feel this overwhelming euphoria at the thought of him being scared  or sad. I have intrusive thoughts of all the fucked up things I could do to him. Not physically  I wouldn’t ever hurt somebody physically. I think about sabotaging his friendships and relationships. Causing chaos in his family. Running background searches and finding every little piece of dirt I can (this is significant as he lied about everything during our relationship - I barely knew him it seems). I daydream about the very worst happening to him  and the thought of psychologically torturing him brings me happiness. 

This feels so wrong. This feels crazy and I hate myself for it. I feel like my brain is rotting away slowly. I’m having suicidal thoughts because this isn’t the person I want to be.

Therapy isn’t an option for me at the moment. I desperately need it. I’ve cried to my doctors and mental health team begging for some kind of intervention. The best they could do was give me a managing explosive emotions workshop which was honestly a steaming pile of shit. I attended 4 sessions before deciding it was of no help (aka  the therapist told us in times of extreme stress and triggers that we should eat a banana to calm down). 

I don’t want to feel this way anymore. I think I’ve grown into a psychopath. I guess I’m posting this because I want to know if anybody has ever felt anything like this and what I can do to stop

I know the obvious advice is therapy. I’m working on it ",19,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1hd8j4r/i_cant_let_go_of_anger_i_feel_like_a_psychopath/

BPD,Sometimes I feel like a rotten human being ,Sometimes I feel like a human who is just rotten to the core. At my worst  I am impulsive  over emotional and absolutely spiteful. I see everyone around me as a threat and I feel like I always have to prove something which just makes me come off as bitter. I find it extremely difficult to be nice to people I do not like  of which there are many  because I am so quick to judge others and put up walls. I try not to engage in negative self talk because I know it doesn't help my case  but it's hard since I see things in black and white. I end up feeling ashamed of my current self and even more ashamed of my past wrongdoings. The past in facts haunts me and I have many regrets. Because my actions affected others too. There are witnesses to my crazy behavior. How do I proceed in the world knowing these things about myself? The shame of my past self combined with present failures seems to much to bear. I know the anecdote is forgiveness and trying to view others as flawed humans just like me. But try as I might I can't shake that I'm different from other people and deeply flawed in ways they are not. And it's such a burden. I just want to try to be better so I don't live with the guilt any more. TLDR: how do I make peace with my past transgressions and how do I move forward to try to be better. I feel emotions so deeply it is hard to see past the shame and regret. ,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1em2ayo/sometimes_i_feel_like_a_rotten_human_being/

BPD,I miss you,"I just need to get this off my chest.

My sister (with BPD if that isn't clear) committed suicide October 3rd. 

I recently got into her computer (she definitely didn't want me getting into her accounts  but na na na boo boo 😝 <3).

I recovered pretty much her entire digital life. Emails  iMessages  therapy exercises  many correspondences with her therapist  her diary  etc.).

I'm her younger brother. I know she intentionally kept things from me  because *""[She didn't] want to burden people with [her] issues""*. My mother (sweetest mom in the world  basically the female Mr. Rogers) also kept things from me  because she *""didn't want to scare me""*. 

I was in the dark about a lot of things. I have a lot of guilt about this. I looked up the disorder online when she was diagnosed  but dude those textbook definitions and lists of symptoms did not help me fully appreciate what it's actually like living with the disorder. I should've talked to her more about it. I don't know if she wouldv'e really opened up if I did.  I have a lot of guilt about that.

I think that's why I wanted so badly to get into her computer. I wanted to know what it's like in her brain. 

Now like I said  I recovered incredibly personal and intimate information between her and her therapist  amongst other things. Things she never would have told us. I can understand why telling other people those things would be hard. But the more I learn  the **PROUDER** I am. Managing her disorder was a **full time fucking job**. And she was diligent and responsible about it  she did everything you're supposed to do. She studied neuroscience and was taking the MCAT (or some acronym related to pre-med). She had folders of coping mechanisms  BPD workbooks  catalogs of quotes from her therapist  all color coded and organized  again a full time job basically. She was actively working hard everyday  just to exist. And from the outside looking in  she seemed to be managing. I hate how oblivious I was. 

She was a fucking SUPER HERO. I saw a post on the front page that I couldn't agree more with. If you put her brain in me for a single day  there's no way I'd last anywhere near as long as she did. 

It breaks my heart unbearably knowing what she was dealing with. She just had shit fucking luck. Her brain was broken and everyone told her to do this and do that  and she did  for decades  and honestly I feel she had every right to end it. I don't know if that's dangerous to say  but I know I don't want her just suffering through life.

I'm kind of spiraling now I just love you Sirena and I miss you so much and I'm so so fucking proud of you. I've never felt anything even close to this level of emotional pain  and it's not even close to what you were dealing with every fucking day.

So I’m a 30 year old woman struggling with BPD & its gotten worse with age. I’ve went out on 2  dates with a guy we’ve been talking for about 2 weeks (everyday)  and our 3rd date is coming up this week. He kisses me passionately  compliments me a lot  holds my hand   tells me how much he likes me. So on our date yesterday I told him “ you seem to like me a lot how long until I’m yours?” . He immediately starts talking about how he got out of a 6 year long relationship 6 months ago and his last relationship started off “ too fast” & he needs to know me more and make sure” we’re sexually compatible” before calling me his girlfriend. I felt so irritated and asked him so “ I have to bang you to show you I’m good enough to be your girlfriend “ then he said “ I don’t believe in starting a relationship without sex first I learned my lesson in my last relationship “. It filled my heart with jealousy and I stopped kissing him & told him “I move fast after going out on 4 dates I want a relationship title”. I’m not sure about going slow with a title because I’m 30 I have limited time I want marriage and kids soon. He starts to tell me “ we’ll see what happens on our 3rd date but I’m talking to other women and I don’t want too go too fast and be with someone I may not have sexual compatibility with”. Anyways I feel worthless now and like im competing with his last relationship and he’s not over his ex & comparing me to her.

BPD,The most triggering thing is how he seems to want to rub in my face how much better he is without me. I feel worthless,"It reminds me to RAYE's lyrics on the song Genesis: ""My ex is on my timeline  it's as if he's showing off"".

But there is no timeline/feed  there is no block button this time.

He cut me off suddenly  no closure (ignored my attempts to have a productive talk)  and it's like I deserve no empathy. Very recently (a little over a week ago) I discovered my mom's breast cancer came back after 9 years and he knows this. It's all just too much to handle  I feel like I'm gonna explode.

Years ago  an ex reacted the same way instantly after breaking up with me. Both that ex and the person I'm talking about now struggle(d) with loneliness  depression  low self-esteem  being stuck in life not being able to do anything because of mental health issues. But it's incredible how removing me from their lives seems like an instant improvement. Happy  joking  social  productive.

It's extremely triggering. I feel worthless. I don't feel like a human being  I feel like an used object. It makes me want to do bad things to myself (I haven't  but I'm using all my strength to fight the impulses).

I have nobody to talk about this except here.

\*\*Edit: I'd like to give some context. What pushed him off is that cried during a call and ended up making him stay up late on Saturday listening to me for 2 hours. Not on purpose  I lost track of time bc of my crisis.  
I did not lash out  raise my voice  or verbally harm in any way. But I did cry a lot. I wanted to talk because I was scared of being alone during a crisis.

I was trying to explain myself he said things that were hurtful to me and he was being very blunt  explaining that probably I wouldn't be that sensitive/emotional if it wasn't for what I'm going through with my mom.

Some of the hurtful things were (and these a just a few things): said he was very annoyed at me  ""this dogshit conversation""  ""fine  can you say what you want to do together tomorrow without taking 20 minutes?""  ""you keep repeating yourself  it's annoying""  ""this is going nowhere""  ""it's not hurtful  this is who I am and how I speak""  ""I want to have fun and feel good when we're together  not this""

I apologized many times for keeping him up late. I said how much I regret what I did and the things I should've done differently. But it doesn't matter.

I ruined everything again. I wish I didn't blame myself  but I do.

Anyway... He's very happy now. And I just cry.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1jdqh6i/the_most_triggering_thing_is_how_he_seems_to_want/

I then come to learn she has DID  and one of her alters doesn't want to be with me at all. On comes a streak of hyper-paranoia that she is going to get with someone else while she's in college. Went to the hospital twice over panic attacks. One night my paranoia catches up to me again when she won't respond despite discord showing she was online. She calls me about 2 hours later after receiving maybe 25+ messages from me saying she fell asleep and still loves me and wouldn't leave me. Day after  as I'm giving a presentation I get a message and it's her telling me she wants to break up with me. About a week or 2 of convincing  getting blocked multiple times  circumventing blocks  complete and utter bedrotting  etc  I finally realise I can't do anything. About 3 months later I start getting attached to a different person who then suddenly starts distancing herself from me (at least I thought so  I genuinely don't know and I can't seem to get a response). Anyways  this sparks me to start texting my ex  who as always  draws me in by making me feel validated. About 2 weeks pass and we are texting each other every day again. Says she still loves me  but in a roundabout way also says doesn't think we can be together. *insert mental chaos*. She says she wants to be *really* close friends (not 100% sure what that exactly means or entails). About 2 days ago however  she finally directly said ""I have no intention of dating you again"". Since then  I haven't been able to talk to her without feeling completely worthless. The issue is we both have winter break from our universities at the same time  and both of our parents live in the same city which we will be staying for the winter. She keeps wanting to do stuff with me  and I want to as well  but I seriously don't know if I have the mental capacity to do that  and not end up hurting myself even more. I really don't know what to do at this point  I just know that I feel worthless with her  and worthless without her.",0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1hf3qj2/ex_wants_to_be_friends_but_i_cant_talk_to_her/

OCD,Please read this before posting about feeling suicidal.,"There has been an increase in the number of posts of individuals who are feeling suicidal. And to be perfectly honest  most of us have been isolated  scared  lonely  and there’s a lot of uncertainty in the world due to COVID.

Unfortunately  most of us in this community are not trained to handle mental health crises. While I and a handful of others are licensed professionals  an anonymous internet forum is not the best place to really provide the correct amount of help and support you need.

That being said  I’m not surprised that many of us in this community are struggling. For those who are struggling  you are not alone. I may be doing well now  but I have two attempts and OCD was a huge factor.

I have never regretted being stopped.

Since you are thinking of posting for help  you won't regret stopping yourself.

So  right now everything seems dark and you don’t see a way out. That’s ok. However  I guarantee you there is a light. Your eyes just have not adjusted yet.

So what can you do in this moment when everything just seems awful.

First off  if you have a plan and you intend on carrying out that plan  I very strongly suggest going to your nearest ER. If you do not feel like you can keep yourself safe  you need to be somewhere where others can keep you safe. Psych hospitals are not wonderful places  they can be scary and frustrating. but you will be around to leave the hospital and get yourself moving in a better direction.

If you are not actively planning to suicide but the thought is very loud and prominent in your head  let's start with some basics. When’s the last time you had food or water? Actual food; something with vegetables  grains  and protein. If you can’t remember or it’s been more than 4 to 5 hours  eat something and drink some water. Your brain cannot work if it does not have fuel.

Next  are you supposed to be sleeping right now? If the answer is yes go to bed. Turn on some soothing music or ambient sounds so that you can focus on the noise and the sounds rather than ruminating about how bad you feel.

If you can’t sleep  try progressive muscle relaxation or some breathing exercises. Have your brain focus on a scene that you find relaxing such as sitting on a beach and watching the waves rolling in or sitting by a brook and listening to the water. Go through each of your five senses and visualize as well as imagine what your senses would be feeling if you were in that space.

If you’re hydrated  fed  and properly rested  ask yourself these questions when is the last time you talked to an actual human being? And I do mean talking as in heard their actual voice. Phone calls count for this one. If it’s been a while. Call someone. It doesn’t matter who  just talk to an actual human being.

Go outside. Get in nature. This actually has research behind it. There is a bacteria or chemical in soil that also happens to be in the air that has mood boosting properties. There are literally countries where doctors will prescribe going for a walk in the woods to their patients.

When is the last time you did something creative? If depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder have gotten in the way of doing creative things that you love  pull out that sketchbook or that camera and just start doing things.

When’s the last time you did something kind for another human being? This may just be me as a social worker  but doing things for others  helps me feel better. So figure out a place you can volunteer and go do it.

When is the last time that you did something pleasurable just for pleasure's sake? Read a book take a bath. You will have to force yourself to do something but that’s OK.

You have worth and you can get through this. Like I said I have had two attempts and now I am a licensed social worker. Things do get better  you just have to get through the dark stuff first.

You will be ok and you can make it through this.

We are all rooting for you.

OCD,Too many suicide posts,I’ve seen SO MANY posts with headers about suicide  0 TW’s and it is really starting to bother me. This is a forum about ocd and people are using it to just blast everyone with super dark statements right out the gate. I don’t want to sound cold or uncaring but it’s really insensitive towards people who are disposed to being concerned/feeling responsible to help the OPs and it feels like it’s becoming a daily thing that I see these. Maybe I’m the only one but I don’t think it’s appropriate without at least a TW and it’s off putting to say the least seeing dozens of threats  which is incredibly disturbing to see constantly.,311,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/13h5tzz/too_many_suicide_posts/
OCD,My OCD is literally ruining my life and I'm considering suicide...,"This might sound extremely intense but my OCD is really driving me insane. I've already been diagnosed with severe depression about 2 years ago and then I developed an insanely strong ocd around last year. I don't know how much longer I can take it.

I've also been to a psychologist for my OCD but it did not help AT ALL.

Here's the situation:

I've always had mild ocd since I was little  always having to line up my slippers and shoes perfectly  making sure everything is tidy etc.: And notably always washing my hands 1-2 extra times which would take a few minutes. 
But I always felt like 1 wash wasn't enough. 

Then last year my OCD skyrocketed. No matter how much I wash my hands (or any other body parts) just don't feel clean.
After I use the bathroom I now wash my hands for 4 hours. I am not joking. I have to make sure every single part of my hands is covered in soap lather or else my intrusive thoughts keep telling me (if there's no soap on that part of your hand it's still dirty) so I always work up such a strong huge lather that it becomes thick and then I really work it in and make sure every inch is covered in it.
I do this several times per wash. Im always overcome by the feeling of soap not cleaning me enough  as if I have to wash and wash until I feel clean. It's almost as if I'm doubting In the soap working. Since my hand washing takes so long I have no more free time and since I hate washing my hands for so long I only go to the bathroom to relieve myself  2 times per day. I also don't like touching anything that I know/think has germs on it or else I want to wash my hands again.
Most of my day is spent literally hand washing. I don't knwo what to do. If I don't see my hands (or legs  arms  torso etc.: Literally covered in soap lather like some wierd soap snowman) I cannot feel clean  and anxiety completely ruins me and I get really on edge.

I just don't know what to do anymore  the fact that I'm already depressed for other unrealated reasons and now that I literally have to spend all day washing myself just to feel clean is maddening. My hands are like literal stone by the way. It's horrific.

Can anyone share some advice? Im trying to lower my washing bit by bit but it's mostly ineffective And not really the root of the problem. It's the fact that I don't trust soap anymore and need to physically see the lather on my body to think im getting clean. Its such a wierd feeling that's hard to describe.

Well anyway this is basically the jist of it. Thank you for reading. If anyone has been faced with someone similar I'd appreciate some input..",159,153,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/z1w7rj/my_ocd_is_literally_ruining_my_life_and_im/
OCD,No one on here should ever feel bad about posting about suicidal feelings.,Yesterday  I saw a post on here that basically told everyone on here to stop posting about feeling suicidal. I don’t want to be argumentative  but I have to put this out there: this is a place for people with OCD to be open and honest and find support. Yes  it’s very sad that suicidal ideation can be common with OCD  but that DOES NOT mean we should censor it. This is supposed to be a safe space of sorts for all of us who are suffering  no matter the extent of it. I hate the thought of that post making anyone who sees it feel guilty for being honest about their feelings on here. I have compassion for the person who posted about not wanting to see that stuff  but ignoring it doesn’t make it go away and it just makes it harder for those suffering to find help if they can’t post about it here.,310,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/12tplnk/no_one_on_here_should_ever_feel_bad_about_posting/
OCD,TW: Suicide. This community saying that people being suicidal is annoying them is toxic and dangerous,Every other post on this sub is complaining about people struggling with suicidal thoughts and ideation and it’s out of control. I don’t disagree with trigger warnings and tags of course but some people genuinely have no where to go and no one to turn to and people with OCD already struggle with horrible guilt so you’re possibly dissuading a person struggling from reaching out for help because they’ll feel bad about it. There are other communities and spaces for recovery based OCD conversations and maybe people should try those instead of suggesting that people use subs like suicide watch which is actively harmful. I don’t know what the solution is to this because filtering out triggering content and using trigger tags has already been implemented but I really think it’s irresponsible to tell people who are struggling that they’re being a nuisance.,303,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/13hyh6i/tw_suicide_this_community_saying_that_people/
OCD,This is for everyone with suicidal thoughts.,"You might not be feeling the best right now  and that's okay! Because I'm not aswell  everyone is dealing with problems  that's natural! You don't actually want to commit suicide  you just don't want to live like this.

Quite ironic to say the least haha  you want life to get better  you want to change something  you want to live happy life's Everyone does! Life is all up and downs  and I think that's what makes this beautiful! This is all a big journey that takes time and effort  spoiler (its all worth it at the end!!)

You are a beautiful human being  you have a beautiful soul and people do care about you and people do love you  maybe you just don't see it.

I really care about you  if I hadn't cared about you  I wouldn't even pick up the phone to write this.

Don’t let your thoughts get to you.

I know this is hard for you right now  but it does get better  please talk with your loved ones  or talk with anyone! There's a lot of lovely people on helplines  they will help you  my dms are also open :)

There is a light at the end of the tunnel.

I'm wishing you the best for the future  and I hope 
you achieve everything you want to achieve.

OCD,TW: contemplating suicide,"I have real event OCD.
I can't stop obsessing over mistakes I made between the ages of 10-14 years old. As soon as I wake up in the morning my OCD automatically says to me ""remember when you did this 2 years ago...and this 6 months ago. oh yeah and do you remember that time when you said that awful thing"" ect and this goes on all day untill I fall asleep. And then I wake up the next day and the cycle continues.
I'm turning 15 in a few months but I don't know if I'll make it to my birthday.
I want to die.
I don't deserve to be alive and my OCD constantly reminds me of this.
But at the same time I know by killing myself I'll hurt my friends and family which is exactly what I don't want to do.

OCD,Scrupulosity is Overwhelming Me,"I don’t usually post on Reddit  I’m more of an observer  but I just really need to vent and let it all out.

I’m thinking of not taking communion anymore because it’s just too hard to keep getting stuck in a cycle of 24/7 examination of conscience and then going to confession and feeling like nothing has changed.

I use to go weekly to confess my sins or at least what I thought were sins until I started going to therapy and was put on Fluoxetine. Even my priest/ confessor told me the weekly confession was a lot and that some of the things I was confessing weren’t really sins  he even suggested I start going to therapy.

I did go and I started taking the medication and things got better. I was diagnosed with OCD and PTSD. My OCD theme tends to revolve around religion and morality  basically Scrupulosity. I even started going to confession every three months instead and it worked for a while but then it just feels like it started again. Now I’m just ruminating about my thoughts and actions for a longer period of time and my confessions don’t feel right.

I’m still taking my medication but I stopped going to therapy because it started to become too expensive and honestly all of a sudden I just started feeling like it wasn’t working anymore.

And I feel so stupid and selfish because I know there are worse things happening out there. My mom and sister keep getting into arguments either each other for their own reasons and I can’t help and blame myself for it and try to take responsibility to stop it. I’m so overwhelmed right now.

And Lent is about to start really soon  I always get so nervous during this time because of the sacrifices and offerings I feel like I need to make and they have to be perfect. And I have to get ready to go to confession before Easter.

I feel so alone and I’m afraid. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’m going to explode.",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1j2k5qb/scrupulosity_is_overwhelming_me/

OCD,Quitting nicotine has made my OCD overwhelmingly bad. Does anyone who has been through it have any tips or tricks?," I quit cold turkey vaping 10 days ago. I was on a pretty high amount  salt nic all day everyday for over a year.



The reason I did cold turkey is because I know how I am  and I have issues doing anything that isn't all-or-nothing.



Since day 2 of being off it  my OCD was horrifically bad. And it's not getting easier. It's day 10 now.



If I had to categorize my OCD I'd call it Real Event OCD. I get intrusive thoughts and ruminate about past events and it's so strong I swear it causes me physical pain. After quitting it basically amplified everything 10000x. Past events are coming at me randomly and I shake and try to make it go away but all I'm left with is circling thoughts and I am convinced I am a bad  awful  perverted person and if there's a hell I'm going to it.



My OCD fluctuates throughout the years and im so upset that I did an objectively good thing (quit a substance) and im rewarded for it by being plunged into mental hell.



I didn't do/don't want to do any NRT such as patches or gum because I know myself and I would not be able to handle doing that. I'd justify being back on it. I have to completely dissociate from the chemical to quit successfully unfortunately.



Besides using patches/gum etc. Is there anything i can do in the short term (aka not try a bunch of new medications which would take a while)

OCD,Influencers are so overwhelming,"I'm bad at explaining things so apologies if this is not clear. DAE find all these influencers pushing products and lifestyle habits and diets to be very anxiety-inducing and overwhelming? I am someone who always either makes mental rules when given any kind of instruction no matter how trivial  or is very strict on following certain rules or routines. So I just find it confusing when one influencer says I do X for perfect skin  and then the next says you HAVE to use Y for glowing flawless skin  and then the NEXT says you have to routinely do Z treatment with W topical to maintain skin. Like  I have this compulsion to do them all because I'm told that's the only way and idk it just makes me scared and anxious that my skin will be bad (using skin as an example  this applies to almost anything like diet  hair care  stress tips idk anything)

It just scares me and confuses me idk I find myself getting increasingly anxious. Cuz then the next influencer says DON'T DO SKINCARE just eat XYZ every day! Like omg 😭 it's all too much.

Like I have this compulsion need for my life and body to be perfectly healthy and a TON of anxiety around common day toxins that are around us so I've already become (arguably) crunchy and I'm just idk I feel overwhelmed and like ""dirty"" I feel like my life is dirty and there's impending doom of being disgusting if I don't do all these things",17,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1hj3nfs/influencers_are_so_overwhelming/

Or spend way too much time thinking about and researching different (and sometimes trivial) topics out of fear of not being ‘problematic’. It just makes my brain work so much harder and it makes me exhausted. Really really makes me want to just go off the grid completely sometimes lol

OCD,Please Help - My Addiction to Cleanliness is Ruining my Life,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I have unofficially declared OCD with being/feeling clean. I am no longer able to think about my college coursework  my girlfriend  my family  my friends  politics  religion  world news  etc. All I ever think about any more is which bathroom on campus have automatic sinks  paper towel dispensers  and door openers so I don't have to touch anything. I plan my morning routine accordingly so I can minimize the amount of times I have to wash my hands. My hands have literally turned reddish/pink and bleed everyday because they're so dry and my hand towel is always wet or very damp. I also have a dedicated sleeve on each of my sweatshirts to open public doors. I wouldn't classify my disorder as germaphobia  as I still use public bathrooms when absolutely needed but I will immediately put those clothes in my dirty laundry pile. At a stadium I recently attended my belt touched the bathroom floor and I just left it there not wanting to ever tough it again. Tonight my girlfriend stepped on my phone charger wearing her sneakers so I'm going to buy a new one tomorrow. I don't know if I would describe my condition as worsening but it's definitely becoming depressing. I could go on for hours probably about my OCD but I've already bored you enough probably. 

I'm ready to finally take action and to turn my life around. What's the process for curing me of something like this or where could I at least start to make tiny steps in the right direction?

OCD,How to Deal with Loneliness When You Have OCD,"I have had severe OCD for about 10 years now (it started when I was 17  and I’m now 27). For the last few years  even with my severe OCD  I was okay with my life. But in the last 4–6 months  I’ve started to feel depressed. Honestly  I don’t like where my thoughts go. I am not able to talk about it with my therapist because I am scared of what door it will open. 

I feel like I’ve pushed people away and closed myself off to new friendships because of my OCD. Now  I feel like I don’t have many close friends. The ones I do have are there for me and supportive  but I find it hard to see them living the kind of life I wish I could have.. relationships  babies  etc. I don’t think that will be in the cards for me  and I’m struggling to accept that. Because of my OCD and everything it has done  I feel like I will probably be alone all my life.

And then there’s the uncertainty  the endless ""what ifs."" It eats away at me. The fear of snapping out  losing control  or just being overwhelmed by my own mind. OCD has even affected my perception of intimacy  making it something I fear rather than something natural. Watching or even thinking about it sends my anxiety through the roof. I wish I could put it into words better  but if you know  you know.

OCD,I don’t feel great about loneliness,"So I have OCD  which I’ve recently wrapped up going through therapy for. One aspect I never talked to my therapist about was romantically. I’m 20  and in a small town so there’s not many women to meet. I’ve tried dating apps but I rarely get responses that last more than one message. I also have this intense irrational feeling that somehow no matter what I’d do I’d get cheated on  and considering how bad I was in my only other serious relationship (one I had back when I was 16)  that it’d be karma. Speaking of that relationship  ever since it I keep getting these random feelings of shame when I think of how crazy I acted back then (that was before therapy) and that leads to thoughts that I don’t deserve love in the first place. It doesn’t help that I feel a sense of nostalgia towards that as well  which I also feel shame for  and I worry that I may never have that feeling again. Regardless  I don’t have much experience  so the last thing that worries me is I’d want to find someone else with little experience so we could figure things out together. But I feel like  as I’m getting older  that’s impossible. Now people my age are getting married and having kids  so I feel like I’m alone on that front. I’ve tried to accept that I’ll probably end up alone  but that thought has freaked me out for the past few years.

Whenever I feel depressed and stuff and cry nonstop when I see how isolated this thing has me  I tell my therapist “yeah  it wasn’t a very nice week  I got scared of getting sick again” and she has said “omg again? Lets just move past this to something else… something that actually matters” and I did understand the first time it happened because I didn’t know I have OCD but then after the diagnosis  I told her again  same reaction.

OCD,Loneliness and OCD,"Hello.


Sorry  this might be a lot more depressing for other people to read. But I don't really know what to do anymore.

I feel transparent by almost everybody in the world. If they could  people would just walk through me without acknowledging me. Whatever I say is only just grazing off of people. I feel extremely ignored to the point where I just shut off and don't even bother  because whats the point?

From online to real life  nobody really interacts with me to where we're wanting to be close  and I feel that it's always unrequited. I say that because lately the friend group that I was in didn't really interact with me  but instead stopped talking to me about whatever. I'm at a point to where my words don't feel like words but just sounds coming from my mouth. I've already lived such a lonely life when I was little  and I can't help but to think how other people lives socially compared to me. I've even tried learning how to be alone  but that's when the most silent room becomes the loudest.

All my friends get DMs too  whereas I barely got any likes or have no comments at all. I know social media is malicious  but it hurts seeing nobody wanting to interact with me.

Even romantically. All my friends get approached  gets DMs  or even have some girl speak to them while I don't really get anything. I don't really force anything since I usually get shut down by a crush that I've been having. I had such bad experiences with being led on that I can't even tell what flirting is. I don't want to embarass myself  so I stopped altogether. 

Really though  I came to understand that getting attention and affection calms me down. I'm just too scared to ask or even give. One simple interaction would make me feel a bit more valued  but if I'm not getting anything constant  I'm back to my usual fucked up self. I feel like everything seems so difficult.

OCD,The loneliness and frustration of no one ever understanding you,"I just got into a heated argument with some friends and family about my condition. I've spoken to a therapist to get started on my very first session to get a diagnosis once and for all.

My friends and family got frustrated with me because I keep going over and over about my condition that they can't empathize or understand at all. A friend and a cousin said that they straight up can't empathize with me at all and think I'm just being overreactive and irrational. They believe me when I say that I'm suspecting OCD but it never feels good to know that they just make it seem like I'm just being stupid. They're not trying to be but it still hurts. My aunt told me to just accept that I'm not a bad person when I had a moral related obsession and she got frustrated with me when I said it's not easy to do.

I understand that it's my problem right now where I keep venting about my problems to them and it's something that's out of their scope to help me. It makes me feel like an utterly horrible human being all the time and I get genuinely angry with myself. I've stopped talking about certain things about myself because of it. I think I just wish I was understood for once. That's all. But no one does  and it makes sense  I don't expect anyone to understand a disorder that they don't experience.

I think what bothered me was that it seemed like me being irrational because of a disorder is hard to understand according to my cousin. I told them that all sorts of mental health problems can have you thinking the most irrational negative things about yourself or situations so I don't understand why that's hard to grasp that I'm stuck in a negative thinking process. They straight up disagreed with me and said it's not as extreme as my condition but that's not what I'm trying to say. It's not like my cousin hasn't bursted into tears and got hysterical talking about how she's going to get made fun of for wearing the wrong color dress for a small get together when in reality no one cared  she kept feeling embarrassed and ashamed afterward because of it. She also suffers from anxiety about lots of things so I don't understand why she doesn't get why I seem irrational towards situations sometimes. I'm literally just saying to her that mental health will make you stuck sometimes and think negatively  that's it. But noooo  I'm the strange one apparently. I just don't understand why no one gets me to at least that degree. It's like everything I say is alien gibberish and uncomfortable to deal with.

I'm frustrated and wish someone understood me but I can't ask for too much because it's just reality that most people don't because they don't have it. :/",4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1e57hns/the_loneliness_and_frustration_of_no_one_ever/

OCD,Please read this before posting about feeling suicidal.,"There has been an increase in the number of posts of individuals who are feeling suicidal. And to be perfectly honest  most of us have been isolated  scared  lonely  and there’s a lot of uncertainty in the world due to COVID.

Unfortunately  most of us in this community are not trained to handle mental health crises. While I and a handful of others are licensed professionals  an anonymous internet forum is not the best place to really provide the correct amount of help and support you need.

That being said  I’m not surprised that many of us in this community are struggling. For those who are struggling  you are not alone. I may be doing well now  but I have two attempts and OCD was a huge factor.

I have never regretted being stopped.

Since you are thinking of posting for help  you won't regret stopping yourself.

So  right now everything seems dark and you don’t see a way out. That’s ok. However  I guarantee you there is a light. Your eyes just have not adjusted yet.

So what can you do in this moment when everything just seems awful.

First off  if you have a plan and you intend on carrying out that plan  I very strongly suggest going to your nearest ER. If you do not feel like you can keep yourself safe  you need to be somewhere where others can keep you safe. Psych hospitals are not wonderful places  they can be scary and frustrating. but you will be around to leave the hospital and get yourself moving in a better direction.

If you are not actively planning to suicide but the thought is very loud and prominent in your head  let's start with some basics. When’s the last time you had food or water? Actual food; something with vegetables  grains  and protein. If you can’t remember or it’s been more than 4 to 5 hours  eat something and drink some water. Your brain cannot work if it does not have fuel.

Next  are you supposed to be sleeping right now? If the answer is yes go to bed. Turn on some soothing music or ambient sounds so that you can focus on the noise and the sounds rather than ruminating about how bad you feel.

If you can’t sleep  try progressive muscle relaxation or some breathing exercises. Have your brain focus on a scene that you find relaxing such as sitting on a beach and watching the waves rolling in or sitting by a brook and listening to the water. Go through each of your five senses and visualize as well as imagine what your senses would be feeling if you were in that space.

If you’re hydrated  fed  and properly rested  ask yourself these questions when is the last time you talked to an actual human being? And I do mean talking as in heard their actual voice. Phone calls count for this one. If it’s been a while. Call someone. It doesn’t matter who  just talk to an actual human being.

Go outside. Get in nature. This actually has research behind it. There is a bacteria or chemical in soil that also happens to be in the air that has mood boosting properties. There are literally countries where doctors will prescribe going for a walk in the woods to their patients.

When is the last time you did something creative? If depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder have gotten in the way of doing creative things that you love  pull out that sketchbook or that camera and just start doing things.

When’s the last time you did something kind for another human being? This may just be me as a social worker  but doing things for others  helps me feel better. So figure out a place you can volunteer and go do it.

When is the last time that you did something pleasurable just for pleasure's sake? Read a book take a bath. You will have to force yourself to do something but that’s OK.

You have worth and you can get through this. Like I said I have had two attempts and now I am a licensed social worker. Things do get better  you just have to get through the dark stuff first.

You will be ok and you can make it through this.

We are all rooting for you.

OCD,Too many suicide posts,I’ve seen SO MANY posts with headers about suicide  0 TW’s and it is really starting to bother me. This is a forum about ocd and people are using it to just blast everyone with super dark statements right out the gate. I don’t want to sound cold or uncaring but it’s really insensitive towards people who are disposed to being concerned/feeling responsible to help the OPs and it feels like it’s becoming a daily thing that I see these. Maybe I’m the only one but I don’t think it’s appropriate without at least a TW and it’s off putting to say the least seeing dozens of threats  which is incredibly disturbing to see constantly.,314,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/13h5tzz/too_many_suicide_posts/
OCD,My OCD is literally ruining my life and I'm considering suicide...,"This might sound extremely intense but my OCD is really driving me insane. I've already been diagnosed with severe depression about 2 years ago and then I developed an insanely strong ocd around last year. I don't know how much longer I can take it.

I've also been to a psychologist for my OCD but it did not help AT ALL.

Here's the situation:

I've always had mild ocd since I was little  always having to line up my slippers and shoes perfectly  making sure everything is tidy etc.: And notably always washing my hands 1-2 extra times which would take a few minutes. 
But I always felt like 1 wash wasn't enough. 

Then last year my OCD skyrocketed. No matter how much I wash my hands (or any other body parts) just don't feel clean.
After I use the bathroom I now wash my hands for 4 hours. I am not joking. I have to make sure every single part of my hands is covered in soap lather or else my intrusive thoughts keep telling me (if there's no soap on that part of your hand it's still dirty) so I always work up such a strong huge lather that it becomes thick and then I really work it in and make sure every inch is covered in it.
I do this several times per wash. Im always overcome by the feeling of soap not cleaning me enough  as if I have to wash and wash until I feel clean. It's almost as if I'm doubting In the soap working. Since my hand washing takes so long I have no more free time and since I hate washing my hands for so long I only go to the bathroom to relieve myself  2 times per day. I also don't like touching anything that I know/think has germs on it or else I want to wash my hands again.
Most of my day is spent literally hand washing. I don't knwo what to do. If I don't see my hands (or legs  arms  torso etc.: Literally covered in soap lather like some wierd soap snowman) I cannot feel clean  and anxiety completely ruins me and I get really on edge.

I just don't know what to do anymore  the fact that I'm already depressed for other unrealated reasons and now that I literally have to spend all day washing myself just to feel clean is maddening. My hands are like literal stone by the way. It's horrific.

Can anyone share some advice? Im trying to lower my washing bit by bit but it's mostly ineffective And not really the root of the problem. It's the fact that I don't trust soap anymore and need to physically see the lather on my body to think im getting clean. Its such a wierd feeling that's hard to describe.

Well anyway this is basically the jist of it. Thank you for reading. If anyone has been faced with someone similar I'd appreciate some input..",156,153,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/z1w7rj/my_ocd_is_literally_ruining_my_life_and_im/
OCD,No one on here should ever feel bad about posting about suicidal feelings.,Yesterday  I saw a post on here that basically told everyone on here to stop posting about feeling suicidal. I don’t want to be argumentative  but I have to put this out there: this is a place for people with OCD to be open and honest and find support. Yes  it’s very sad that suicidal ideation can be common with OCD  but that DOES NOT mean we should censor it. This is supposed to be a safe space of sorts for all of us who are suffering  no matter the extent of it. I hate the thought of that post making anyone who sees it feel guilty for being honest about their feelings on here. I have compassion for the person who posted about not wanting to see that stuff  but ignoring it doesn’t make it go away and it just makes it harder for those suffering to find help if they can’t post about it here.,312,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/12tplnk/no_one_on_here_should_ever_feel_bad_about_posting/
OCD,TW: Suicide. This community saying that people being suicidal is annoying them is toxic and dangerous,Every other post on this sub is complaining about people struggling with suicidal thoughts and ideation and it’s out of control. I don’t disagree with trigger warnings and tags of course but some people genuinely have no where to go and no one to turn to and people with OCD already struggle with horrible guilt so you’re possibly dissuading a person struggling from reaching out for help because they’ll feel bad about it. There are other communities and spaces for recovery based OCD conversations and maybe people should try those instead of suggesting that people use subs like suicide watch which is actively harmful. I don’t know what the solution is to this because filtering out triggering content and using trigger tags has already been implemented but I really think it’s irresponsible to tell people who are struggling that they’re being a nuisance.,300,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/13hyh6i/tw_suicide_this_community_saying_that_people/
OCD,This is for everyone with suicidal thoughts.,"You might not be feeling the best right now  and that's okay! Because I'm not aswell  everyone is dealing with problems  that's natural! You don't actually want to commit suicide  you just don't want to live like this.

Quite ironic to say the least haha  you want life to get better  you want to change something  you want to live happy life's Everyone does! Life is all up and downs  and I think that's what makes this beautiful! This is all a big journey that takes time and effort  spoiler (its all worth it at the end!!)

You are a beautiful human being  you have a beautiful soul and people do care about you and people do love you  maybe you just don't see it.

I really care about you  if I hadn't cared about you  I wouldn't even pick up the phone to write this.

Don’t let your thoughts get to you.

I know this is hard for you right now  but it does get better  please talk with your loved ones  or talk with anyone! There's a lot of lovely people on helplines  they will help you  my dms are also open :)

There is a light at the end of the tunnel.

I'm wishing you the best for the future  and I hope 
you achieve everything you want to achieve.

OCD,TW: contemplating suicide,"I have real event OCD.
I can't stop obsessing over mistakes I made between the ages of 10-14 years old. As soon as I wake up in the morning my OCD automatically says to me ""remember when you did this 2 years ago...and this 6 months ago. oh yeah and do you remember that time when you said that awful thing"" ect and this goes on all day untill I fall asleep. And then I wake up the next day and the cycle continues.
I'm turning 15 in a few months but I don't know if I'll make it to my birthday.
I want to die.
I don't deserve to be alive and my OCD constantly reminds me of this.
But at the same time I know by killing myself I'll hurt my friends and family which is exactly what I don't want to do.

OCD,I want to kill myself,"I(18F) can’t get through the day. POCD is ruining my life. I know that I’m not a P but I keep thinking about when I tried to check by myself by masturbating. It makes me feel so guilty to even have done that. 

I was one day masturbating to normal stuff when I kept getting intrustive thoughts. So I decided to check myself. I don’t know what I was imagining but I kept telling myself it was this random kid. I was horrified and scared while I masturbating and orgasmed. I tried to tell myself it was some kind of groin response but I’m scared. I didn’t enjoy it but I feel so much guilt for doing it. Even if it was some vague picture in my mind.

Every time I meet people I think “You would be disgusted if you knew what I did”. Whenever I see the kid I tested myself too  I feel so sick. I know I didn’t enjoy it and was horrified the whole time but I still feel so much guilt about that. I did that. I don’t think I deserve to live. If I told anyone about this  then they would think I’m sick. Please help.

OCD,constantly repeating “i want to kill myself” in my head,does anyone else do this frequently when down or upset? not sure if it’s an ocd thing i’m always feeling down though so it’s pretty constant when trying to force myself to do things that i don’t understand the purpose of but have to do and stuff  or when in anxiety inducing situations which includes basically any situation that involves me being outside of my room and around people. i’m looking for a job right now  my first one  and it’s been difficult. i think it’s because i realize just how horrible i am mentally and know that the jobs around here are horrible and will only make me worse. then i take into account what every must think of me not finding one. then i remember that nothing matters and that i don’t care about any of this. life is just so weird. don’t really feel connected to any of these words which i say constantly. idk what to do anymore. i don’t want to kill myself but if i had nobody that would be hurt i would’ve killed myself ages ago. that’s the only reason i stay. i don’t care about the future or interests or goals or money. i just don’t want to hurt my mom and loved ones  or leave my dogs alone even if they wouldn’t be. life is so gloomy. i’m terrified to work anywhere as well because of my emotionally abusive ex that i fear seeing anytime i go anywhere. i don’t know what to do  or what’s expected of me  but i am trying  even though i know none of it actually matters in the big picture. i don’t even know what productivity means. it’s all just made up. life is just so confusing and exhausting  and the guilt i feel from saying things like this is too because guilt is just a made up concept also. i don’t know,7,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/woh9gd/constantly_repeating_i_want_to_kill_myself_in_my/

OCD,i am SO repulsed by myself!! i feel like i cant go on…,"(19F) so last night i masturbat3d  a lot has happened then  it left me feeling more ashamed than pleasure  but its got even worse today!!

so i woke up and felt a lot of sensations down there and it was due to masturb4ting last night. all i was doing was feeling those sensations down there  it basically felt like something was turning me on  THATS the feeling down there. i was rubbing it with my thighs cuz i still felt arousal from last night but then  i saw something unexpected today!! i dont wanna mention it because im already not feeling okay. i couldn’t tell if it was genuine arousal or a groinal response when it happened as i was already rubbing “it” with my thighs. it was almost like i was getting it off to it even though i literally did not see that coming  and when i saw it  i immediately stopped!

but now my heads replaying that moment again!! basically checking to see if i get arousal and i felt it once and then i didnt feel it again  THEN i felt the arousal again and AGH… i know i shouldnt be checking but i literally cannot control it  its doing it on its own.

OCD,"Anyone on SNRI and not SSRI? Most brilliant psychiatrist found after years of suffering. Basically your amygdala is the ""ass""","I found the literal perfect psychiatrist who specializes in ocd after YEARS.

He took a piece of paper and a pen and drew everything from my brain in detail  where ocd ""sits"" in your brain (your amygdala is the biggest ass in this disease).

He showed me how  my front part of my brain is ""me"" my logic  emotions  etc...but my OCD got so bad that the amygdala grew bigger.

This is literally showed on brain scans with people that has severe ocd

So he prescribed me a SNRI   that's going to attack my amygdala   punish it (going through hell  but the worst is over)  and then my amygdala will start to shrink and my logical part of my brain will be stronger  then we're starting something called psychoanalytic therapy  I cannot remember the correct name sorry about that.

Please note I do NOT remember everything he said with those big ass words lol. 

There's a lot in play with ocd  but yea  ""Amygdala ""is baaassiclyyyy the route problem or something


Edit: after 2 weeks or so on the meds  my brain got so quiet it started feeling abnormal. Like i just got a anxiety attack because it's like my OCD is constantly telling me ""WTF!!?? FIGHT BACK! YOU CAN'T BE THIS CALM!!!""

Edit 2: Get a psychiatrist that UNDERSTANDS ocd so much that your jaw starts haning open

Every single therapist and psychiatrist didn't know the term ""Pure Ocd"" and just sat there and kept prescribing bullshit

When I was in his office for one minute and started explaining   he was like ""yup  Pure ocd  lemme show you"" my mind was blown

OCD,What is a compulsion you do that you're not really sure why you do it?,"Mine is I have to like/save every post I see. 
Even if it's on a topic I don't like

I likely have hundreds of thousands of posts saved over the years across all platforms and i'd say I probably have liked about a million. 

Over the last two days I have been going through my saved on Reddit and I can proudly say I only have 2 posts in my saved. 

I'm dreading going through tikrok and Instagram  tiktok alone has about 50 00 in the favorite folder. Instagram is probably over that and YouTube...i don't even want to think about. 

Removing things from favorites is hard because ""what if I want to watch that? What if I want to read that? Knowing damn well the likely hood of me doing that is low and a lot of those posts have been sat there for years

Thing is I'm not sure why I do it 😭 I just can't scroll on to the next post unless I like/favorite it (I even saved my own posts before 🤣)",338,258,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1az1gmf/what_is_a_compulsion_you_do_that_youre_not_really/
OCD,I'm terrified to try and treat my OCD BECAUSE it might stop my symptoms. But I can't go on any more. It's emotionally devastating either way.,"I have debilitating symptoms that largely revolve around documenting and photographs and I'm terrified of losing time and forgetting EVERY moment (I am even screenshotting this because I need to document everything I do every day). I take photo of literally everything from every meal I have to when I'm on the laptop  where in my room I am working  the shifts I have of work  everything I watch on TV with one of each person that is on that show  a new photo of every stretch when I'm on a walk etc etc...

But it's incredibly emotional for me and the anxiety is too much. It's worse when it comes to family as I'm constantly terrified of everyone I know dying and not being able to remember them so I think I am allowing myself to forget them and not care about them if I don't take pictures of them in everything we do. But I spend all my time with them in constant agitation and anxiety waiting to take photos and it drives them crazy which ends up in arguements and I break down in terror and tears if I can't document it all. That alongside not being able to look at myself in photos as I hate how I look but also needing to have myself in photos to provide was there and to remember times I shared- it's too much to bear.

So special occasions are beyond unbearable - even going on a short walk is too much for me as I need to take hundreds of photos and everyone hates it. So as soon as I know about any plans I'm constantly worrying and anxious about it and I spend the time during completely unable to enjoy the moment and in constant rumination about what would happen if I don't take photos and stressing about when I can take them all the time.

 And then they aren't good enough after I have taken them and I'll spend weeks looking at them in anguished tears as they aren't good enough or plentiful enough or I've taken them wrong or I'm not in enough/any of them but I also dwell on how awful I look and regret not looking different etc. (I'm almost certain I had body dysmorphia for many years but I also did/do look very strange).

It's exhausting  humiliating  depressing and it's ruining my relationship with my family as well as ruining every moment of every day.

So I dread Christmas as it's one of my biggest triggers. I'm already terrified of it and am dreading even starting to put up decorations etc as I can never document it enough and the stress and anxiety of it is too much plus I spend all of the holiday periods literally wailing in tears and anxiety.

Anyway  apologies  this turned into a rant. But I've never managed to talk to people about it. I had a horrible experience with a psychotherapist who literally laughed at me when I told her about this and discharged me saying there was nothing wrong and I needed to ""take responsibility for my life"". 

So I've not had an official diagnosis but the more I read I think this counts as OCD.

I have managed to convince my GP to give my Lexapro (which I'm terrified to start) but I don't know if it's the right thing to be on?

This is one example of my issues - there are many more and this also takes over my life in all situations. (I also can't do things with other people for the same reason as above and social anxiety and I can't even take holidays by myself as I still need to document everything and it's too emotionally and physically draining). I basically can't do anything anymore. I'm riddled with anxiety  phobias  depression and constant negative ruminantion and intrusive thoughts.


TL;DR:
But  the point I originally wanted to make (after all this rambling SORRY!) I am also terrified of actually treating my symptoms! To stop myself documenting everything feels like I am giving up on my loved ones and I don't care about them. Or that I am living a pointless existence as I will forget it all and it might as well never have happened. And if I don't document everything then I will forget it all (I have chronic health issues and terrible memory) and life will be nothing but a pointless blur. If I don't remember everything what was the point of it happening at all? I might as well not exist. I want to stop all of this but also don't want to actually stop doing it because of what will happen.

So my fear is that I'll medicate or get treatment and I'll stop all of this only for it all to come back with a vengeance and I will be an absolutely wreck that I have not done what is most important and essential to me and I won't be able to get over all of the important times that I have not documented and will have forgotten. It's so heavily emotionally based that it has more than taken over my life for the last decade plus.

So in essence I am terrified of carrying on as I am and I am terrified of treating myself and not continuing as I am. I'm exhausted and often just want everything to end as I can't take it anymore.

i just dislike it when they act like they know what they’re talking about. i have no problem with people who practice it for THEMSELVES!!

i think im no longer the religion that i was born as cuz it only ended up resulting in fear. especially when they tell me that God will forgive me but how would i even know if im forgiven or not? 

anyways  i dont hate people who are religious but i just cant stand it when they think they have all the answers  especially when it comes to ocd and many other mental disorders and illnesses. and there are soooo many religions too! and in the end  u just… go to hell if the one u practice isnt the truth? 

my point is  im just tired that they think that they can save me. 

and what infuriates me the most is when they think people are making “excuses” when they are struggling or when they have trauma. 

just because u are able to practice it with ease doesnt mean its the same for everyone! how can one even say that when they know nothing about what they’ve endured???

OCD,I just feel like life is so bleak and meaningless with all this anxiety and paranoia ,"I can’t date because my OCD tells me that every girl I meet is going to somehow conspire against me or girls I’ve dated in the past will come out of nowhere and say horrible things about me that aren’t true. 

I feel like I’m going to be arrested and accused of life ruining crimes even though I literally don’t do anything illegal  I live life as straight and narrow as they come. 

Sure I’ve done my fair share of stupid stuff but nothing that crosses any ethical or legal line. 

I think a lot of this stems from my abusive ex girlfriend telling me multiple times if I left her she would call the police and leverage accusations about me that weren’t true to get me arrested. She would message girls I dated after we broke up and make up stuff about me. 

This alongside my health anxiety (guess they don’t call it hypochondria anymore) 
And my paranoid delusions that people are going to poison me or drug me makes life so unbearable that I don’t see a point. 
I could never actually **ll myself because death is my biggest fear.

OCD,Is OCD really this debilitating?,"For context  I have severe health OCD and contamination OCD. I also am possibly on the autism spectrum. 

Sometimes I truly wonder if it actually is this debilitating or if something else is underlying. I can’t go out in public anymore  my physical symptoms are so severe that I can’t do anything but lay in bed  they are so severe that I wonder if it’s a chronic illness instead  I can’t do my online school work  I can’t hang out with friends  I don’t enjoy things I normally would anymore  I’m starting to lose hope  every day I’m unbalanced  floaty feeling  pressure on my chest  weird tightness where my heart is  PVC beats  headaches  my heart races when I get up  I feel weak  I’m so tired not physically but mentally   I don’t have motivation to keep up with my hygiene  I can’t even walk down the road without panicking  I can hardly even sit in a car to go to the doctors  my appetite is completely lost and I’ve started losing weight  I’ve started to even get depressed because I realize how sad my life is  I worry over every single symptom and every sensation I feel. Everything feels so real and so intense. It ruined my birthday  I didn’t even enjoy it or do anything. I’m so exhausted.

I’m not even exaggerating  I eat  drink water  sleep  and lay in bed all day. I don’t do anything. I’m only 17 and it already feels like my life is about half over. Each day that goes by feels so hopeless and meaningless that they have started to merge. 

I really started to go downhill whenever the election happened. Then my therapist didn’t have any openings for 3 more weeks so I haven’t left the house  my life 360 says I’ve been in my home since  my life 360 says I’ve been in my home since November 14th. My symptoms got really bad (which i definitely was sick with something looking back) and I went to the doctors and I was fine once again probably just a cold  and now I just feel the same symptoms I listed above every day. I stopped taking hydroxyzine cause I found out that it can cause heart issues and haven’t felt safe to take it since. I was prescribed Zoloft for the second time  it worked the first time but now my mind is too scared to take it again for fear it may make me worse. So I can’t take medication. I genuinely don’t know what to do anymore  my life is so depressing. I’ve just started to go completely downhill. In 2022 the same month we are in now I went to a mental hospital for the first time  I’m about to voluntarily go for a second time because I genuinely don’t know what to do anymore. I was doing really well after the first admission but then I started taking Prozac instead of Zoloft because Zoloft wasn’t helping my social anxiety (turned out to be caused by me being neurodivergent and medication wouldn’t help) and prozac made me relapse completely and now I feel even worse than when went the first time.

Is OCD really this debilitating? It feels like I genuinely have to have something else  there’s no way that something mental can really cause this much devastation in someone’s life. Right? I don’t even know anymore. I’m trying to stay positive but I just want to break down and cry. I feel so lost and hopeless  am I really this broken mentally that it’s ruining my entire life? I would appreciate any support and motivation to keep going because I genuinely feel emotionless. ",31,72,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1gxm7nh/is_ocd_really_this_debilitating/
OCD,How I've learned to overcome Existential OCD (And OCD in general),"I had severe Existential OCD for about 5-6 weeks  and now I'm free from this theme. I'm gonna give some tips below to those who are struggling with this theme. But before that  I want you to know that recovery is 100% possible & remission rates are extremely high. I know that this theme absolutely sucks  and at times it can feel like the worst theme possible. You may be feeling like you can't recover because of how awful this theme is  but I promise it's recoverable. I've recovered from it before I even went to therapy (Still gonna bring it up when I go tho lol)

Now to recover  here are some extremely helpful tips that I've found and applied to my daily life:

Tip 1. Don't fight the thoughts. I know you might want to ""push"" the thoughts out of your head  but that's only causing an adverse effect. You need to accept the thoughts and just keep going. You need to trick your brain into believing that these thoughts are NOT a threat.

Tip 2. Don't ruminate on any thoughts. I know this is harder than it seems  but don't stay stuck on a single thought.

Tip 3. Spend less time looking for a cure or anecdotal treatment for this disorder. I know it's extremely hard to not look for help while you're in a rut  but that is ultimately reassurance seeking which only strengthens the thoughts. And more often than not  you'll find so many horror stories from doing this.

Tip 4. Practice mindfulness techniques. I know how cringey and corny it can sound  but bringing yourself back into the moment is absolutely helpful.

Tip 5. I recently downloaded the app called ""Oto"" (Not affiliated) which is primarily used for Tinnitus but I used it in an alternative way  which majorly helped me with my OCD.

Tip 6. Remember that OCD feeds off of fear & anxiety  so try to do more things that make you happy. Also don't fear the thoughts  fearing them only makes it stronger.

Tip 7. Medication  medication  MEDICATION!!! While this is completely anecdotal  I find that Lamictal has completely changed my thought process. Lamictal is known to exacerbate OCD symptoms in most people  so I cannot recommend it for most  but in my experience it has been an absolute life changer.

Tip 8. Another anecdotal tip  so you don't have to take my advice on this  but I absolutely love me some tea lol. I've been drinking green tea  peppermint tea and chamomile tea nonstop!!

Tip 9. Being sarcastic towards your thoughts is also a great strategy (Which has been used in therapy settings with scientific evidence to back its efficiency). An example; Thought: ""Your life is meaningless"" Sarcastic Response: ""Oh noo  my life is meaningless  womp womp"". It sounds silly but it works lol.

Tip 10. Give yourself some time & don't set a deadline for when you should recover. It may take days for some or even years. Don't tell yourself ""If I don't recover by **** then I'm gonna give up"" Be patient  it'll be worth it!

Thats all I got for now  but it really has been such a help for me  and I know it will help you guys too. My OCD has gone from severe to moderate  and I expect it to drop even lower soon! 

Be patient  recovery is always possible with time & remission is always possible. I love you guys  take care of yourself <3",21,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1j03gw1/how_ive_learned_to_overcome_existential_ocd_and/
OCD,Help if you can..,"I don’t even know where to begin  but I feel like I need to let this out. For what feels like forever  I’ve been trapped in a relentless cycle of negative thoughts that just won’t leave me alone. Every single day  I’m haunted by the same questions: What’s the point of my life? Why am I even here? The thought of ending it all has become a constant presence in my mind. It feels like I spend more time planning for my death than I ever do planning for a future.

I’m completely drained—emotionally  mentally  and physically. I’ve lost all my energy and motivation. I’ve stopped working  not because I don’t want to  but because I can’t even find the strength to get out of bed. Talking to people feels impossible. Things that once mattered to me  things I used to enjoy  now feel completely meaningless. I’ve isolated myself  trapped in my own head  unable to escape.

There are times when I feel like I’m suffocating  as if the air has been pulled out of my lungs. I can’t even catch my breath properly  especially when I realize I’ve spent another day alone  doing nothing. The pressure in my chest feels so heavy that I’m convinced it’s going to crush me. And sometimes  even when I do try to speak  I feel like the words are stuck inside me  and I can’t get them out.

I’ve noticed that talking to someone—just having a conversation—offers a brief sense of relief. It distracts me  gives me something to focus on other than the endless storm of negative thoughts. But those moments of peace don’t last long  and the heaviness always comes back.

Anxiety  fear  and stress have taken over my life. Every single day feels heavier than the last. Even the idea of leaving the house or going somewhere terrifies me. I feel frozen  like I’m too scared to move. And to make it worse  I can’t shake the feeling that people around me are just using me—that I’m only useful to them when they need something  and once they get it  I’m left alone again. The relationships I thought I could depend on have become sources of pain.

I’ve reached a point where I hate everything. I hate myself. I hate people. I hate life. And it’s not just hate—I don’t even feel emotions anymore. No happiness  no sadness  just emptiness. There’s this huge void inside me  and no matter what I try  I can’t fill it.

I know people always say  “Try to think positively ” but it’s so much easier said than done. I do try. I really do. But the negative thoughts always win. They’re louder  stronger  and more overwhelming.

I’m not sharing this for pity or attention. I’m sharing this because I genuinely need help. If there’s anyone out there who has felt like this—who has been in this darkness and made it out the other side—please  tell me how. How do you escape this? How do you start living and feeling again?

Even the smallest word  the tiniest piece of advice  could mean everything to me. It could be the difference between holding on and letting go.

Thank you to anyone who reads this  and to anyone who takes the time to respond. Just knowing that someone out there is listening might be the first step toward saving my life.",5,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1ic5ql3/help_if_you_can/
OCD,How I'm slowly but surely recovering from Existential OCD/Existential Anxiety,"Recently  for around the past few weeks  I've been experiencing a severe episode of Exitsental OCD. I've constantly been thinking about ""oh life is futile"" ""life is meaningless"" and all the other jibber jabber that this sick illness throws my way. But slowly it's been getting better overtime and it's severly manageable now. If you read thru my post history  I've been constantly looking for ways to treat this and I've actually found some methods to treat this (You could even do this at home  but best under supervision of a therapist or licensed professional)

One method thats helped me was to get into philosophy  but not only to get into philosphy  but to create my own philosophical outlook not yet known by the public. I've come up with Theistic Eudainosim.

I've also been strengthening my personal relationship with God  in a universalist christianity sense  but with my own twists on the religion.

I've also been some slight meditation and mindfulness  as well as setting daily affirmations for my mornings.

I've also read of the buddhist tradition of sleep deprivation  using it as a tool to slow down the mind. I haven't personally ""forced"" this but I am a bit of an insomniac so I'm nearly always up all night lol  but it actually does show some proof in slowing down my thoughts (Please don't force this one or try to actively use it though.)

I'm also currently on Lamictal  which I know is known to cause an increase intrusive thoughts  which it has. But I'm hoping to get on Clomipramine aswell soon.

I hope my advice can help some others struggling with this. Love you guys!

OCD,Can't stop ruminating and it's exhausting. ,"As the title says. I'm so obsessive (thanks to narcissism Im obsessed with myself and thanks to OCD i'm also obsessed with everything else.) It's so exhausting. I can't turn my brain off. I can't stop obsessing over everything. Sometimes it's a good obsession and it doesn't bother me. I could spend hours obsessing over how great I am but that's not why I'm here. I spend so much time obsessing over everything else too. Over fucking stupid trivial things like what order I'm going to get ready for work in  exactly what time to call the uber  exactly how many hours I have left before my next shift  exactly how many times I crack my bones at night  exactly how I'm going to do every little thing and what everything means. If I don't have the answer to something I'll obsess over the possibilities. It's so fucking exhausting and I don't know how to stop. I can never make my brain be quiet. If I'm not obsessing over myself (which is also ""bad"" I guess) I'm obsessing over some stupid trivial meaningless thing that other people pay no damn mind to.

Can anyone relate to this or have any advice? Obsessing over menial everyday tasks is sucking all the life and energy out of me ",5,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1gvf8du/cant_stop_ruminating_and_its_exhausting/
OCD,Imagined scenarios with real event OCD,"Please no reassurance!

I have diagnosed OCD and I also think I have maladaptive daydreaming-- that is  I always have some sort of imagined scenario that is like the default thought in my brain for a given period of time-- usually a couple positive and a couple negative. Super super distracting even when good. 

Recently  I have spent literally any time when my brain is not actively thinking about something going over two main negative imagined scenarios that are sort of a follow up to conflicts that actually happened with people  ie like imagining what I would say  repeating it over and over with slight variations. It's like being in an extremely upsetting/angering argument 24/7 that keeps me in constant fight or flight. 

Honestly driving me crazy. This has happened most of my life  but more now. I have a pretty decent amount of practice with mindfulness and ERP  but I have a hard time with pure O/mental compulsions because I'll realize I'm thinking those things literally every like 2 minutes all day but I'll go back to thinking about it 10 seconds later. I can handle it if I'm like sitting down doing a meditation with my eyes closed  but just doing regular stuff it is so annoying (and I do also try to practice mindfulness throughout the day). 

I can't tell exactly how to exposure therapy this-- I know for mental compulsions you can imagine the upsetting thought over and over again until it feels meaningless for exposure  but given that I dive into it so deeply and it's not like a super distressing thought that I immediately push away  it doesn't seem like that's responding to the root of the compulsion? I don't know if acknowledging the thought and moving away would turn into pushing it out of my mind tho. 

Would be curious if anyone has been successful in something similar.",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1ifbzcq/imagined_scenarios_with_real_event_ocd/
OCD,Recovery from Solipsism/Simulation OCD,"You’ve heard about solipsism and now you’re scared to death. You question the existence of everything and everyone. You feel trapped in your mind with no way out. You’re unsure whether to trust your senses because everyone and everything could be a mental projection. You feel like you’re being tricked by your mind  but you also can’t live apart from your senses. 

*So what do you do?* You spend your days ruminating  researching  seeking reassurance  testing  checking  studying philosophy  seeking certainty. You’re like the squirrel off Ice Age chasing the acorn. Every time you grab it  it’s taken away from you. The compulsions might provide seconds of relief  but honestly those few seconds are worth it considering the hell you live with day in and day out. 

If you were like me  you spend every waking moment  every second of every day  trapped in your head. Ruminating  Resisting  Fighting  and losing. You might feel like giving up. 

***Well  what is solipsism?*** Solipsism is a philosophical theory which posits that nothing can be known outside the self. The external world and other minds cannot be known and might not exist outside or your own head. 

***What does that mean?*** Well  it means that everything you experience may be a projection or simulation of your mind. Because you cannot know the minds of others or what’s going on outside the door of your own home  it may all be a mental construction.  

Have you seen the movie Inception? Your subconscious may be creating people in your life who are not real. In fact  none of it may be real. You may be living in a false reality. *Scary  isn’t it?*

This brings us to simulation theory. Simulation theory is a hypothesis which proposes that everything we experience in the world is a simulated reality. We may be living in a computer simulation similar to the movie the Matrix or the video game the Sims. We may all be coded constructs living in a fake digital world. Which means that everything we experience may not be real. You may be living within a false reality.

***Have you seen the Truman Show?*** Personally  I believe the Truman Show is the greatest horror film ever made. The movie is simulation theory on steroids. It shows how a person can be trapped inside a false reality without knowing it. What’s worse  everyone within the world may be working against you. Trying to trick you into believing that everything is real and there’s no need to worry.  

Are you afraid yet? 

Now  you’re probably thinking  thanks guy! 

*· How do I get these thoughts  obsessions  worries  out of my head?* 

*· How do I get back to feeling normal again?* 

*· How do I live like I did before encountering these ideas?*  

Here’s the answer and I want you to listen carefully. 

**You must learn to accept the idea of living within a reality in which your greatest fear is a possibility.** 

· It is possible everything you experience is false. It may not be real.

· It is possible you’re in a simulation and others may be working against you. 

· It is possible your life may be meaningless and your existence pointless. 

I want you to recognize the possibility of these things being true. Because your OCD HATES possibility. It HATES uncertainty. Your OCD wants you to give it undeniable  inscrutable  unassailable  insurmountable  unquestionable  perfect certainty.

But that’s the trick OCD plays within every theme: it demands certainty in an uncertain world. It demands to know whether you have aids or love your partner or turned the stove off or hit somebody with your car. It wants you to prove repeatedly that your fears are untrue. It holds you hostage until you can give it absolute perfect certainty.

But absolute certainty is an illusion. **We cannot be absolutely certain about anything.** I’m not certain the roof won’t cave in on my head right now. I’m not certain I won’t die of a heart attack before posting this. I’m not certain the world exists outside my office door. It’s possible these things may be true.

**But the possibility of something being true doesn’t make it true.** It may be possible the roof might fall in on me  but I do not believe it’s probable. I’m willing to take the risk of sitting underneath this roof given the structure of the building and the confidence I have in its construction. The probability of something depends on a variety of different factors. And as human beings  we use our senses to make these assumptions all the time. We live with confidence and not certainty. Now you may call it *functional certainty* or *reasonable certainty*  but really all we have is confidence given what we know. 

The reason why these obsessions **FEEL** true is because they scare the crap out of you. When we encounter obsessions our bodies go into fight/flight mode. Adrenaline and cortisol raise through our veins and our bodies prepare for danger. Those bodily feelings make these obsessions feel more probable than they actually are. We misinterpret these feelings a validity of our fears being true.  Our obsessions feel dangerous because we treat them as such. We resist.  

If you and I were forced to live with absolute certainty  we would get nothing done. We would not be able to get out of bed in the morning. Because we’re human beings. We are finite. We are unable to determine the future or correct the past. We cannot know anything for certain apart from confidence and faith. 

And that’s what makes OCD so tricky. It is the doubting disorder. It will make you doubt everything. It is the greatest skeptic you will ever meet. And you will never outargue ocd. It will prove you wrong time and time again. Once you think you’ve reached absolute certainty you will quickly discover another *what if?* Another hole in your theory. So  you go back to the drawing board- *resisting  ruminating  researching  seeking reassurance.* 

You will find no relief doing these things. What you resist  persists. Resistance is the fuel that keeps the OCD fires burning. So please  stop researching philosophy  existentialism  solipsism  simulation theory. Stop seeking reassurance here and elsewhere. Stop doing these things in order to prove these theories wrong. Every argument you find online will be insufficient. Because there are no arguments which provide what OCD demands: absolute certainty.   

Acceptance is the only way out. You must face your fears in order for them to disappear. The only way out is through. 

Remember  **you must accept the idea of living within a reality in which your greatest fear is a possibility.** 

When you do this  you prove to your mind that these thoughts are not dangerous. You become comfortable once again living within a world of possibility. Your mind may even stop sending those thoughts because they no longer captivate you. They may still come and go but you welcome them. You welcome their possibility.

There’s more that can be said  but I hope you find this helpful. I have lived with OCD for 23 years and this theme was the hardest for me. I’m not fully recovered. Some days are still a struggle. But through therapy  ERP  ACT  and Self Compassion  I’m doing much better. In fact  I’ve never been healthier. 

What made this theme especially hard for me was the lack of information for it online. I hope this changes that in a small way. If you’re struggling with these obsessions  I urge you to get the help you need. I have listed the resources that have helped me below.

God bless.

OCD,Compulsions over random words used to calm myself down,Hi All. I have struggled with depression  anxiety  and OCD for many years. For the most part  I’ve been able to feel fine overall and live my life normally  but over the last year it has started to get worse and episodes have happened more often. One of my more recent obsessions is having to always find a “new” word to say to myself in my head to calm myself down or help me feel relaxed when I’m having bad anxiety. For example  many times I would say something like “you’re fine” or “you’re ok” to myself whenever I was anxious and for a long time  that would work and my anxiety would subside. But for whatever reason  one day my OCD brain decided “nope you can’t use those words anymore to calm down  you have to find a different word to use”. And then I’m like searching through my head to find a synonym to fine or ok so I can say that instead. And then if I try to say “fine” or “ok” I’ll be scared it means something bad is going to happen or my intrusive thoughts will come true. The good part is  I know it’s all completely irrational and makes absolutely no sense  but my brain gets caught in this horrible loop of worrying about worrying over things that are completely and utterly meaningless. Thanks everyone for reading and I hope you’re all doing well!,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1fq1thg/compulsions_over_random_words_used_to_calm_myself/
OCD,How I Am Overcoming OCD/ Pure OCD,"Quick Background:
I have had OCD for 3 years now  all through high school. I would classify my OCD as pure ocd because it’s always an irrational thought that explodes into something way more worrying  which leads to compulsions such as avoiding  intense rumination for long periods of time typically overtaking my main life priorities  and looking for reasons to back up my beliefs.


OVERCOMING OCD: MY TRIPLE LAYERED STRATEGY

1. Don’t do startup compulsions: Don’t google things  don’t try to make meaning of meaningless thoughts  don’t avoid anything. Understand that people without OCD will have a worrisome thought such as “What if I get robbed tonight ” and instead of going to hide all of their possessions  they ‘accept the uncertainty’ (key words for beating ocd) but with low probability for negative results. They simply allow the thought to come and go  and take a small chance that they may get robbed.

2. Expose yourself to the thing: it will just provoke anxiety at first  there will be no realization. After a while  the anxiety will decrease. Just trust the process  it’s all you have. This is ERP to my knowledge  for example if I am afraid to touch a pan because it MAY have the germs to kill me  I will still touch the pan any time I need to and accept all of the anxiety it provokes. If you do more noticeable physical compulsions like hand washing  stop the hand washing and accept the anxiety. This anxiety will decrease hugely in time. The reason ERP took me so long to grasp is because I would always p*ssy out way too early and expect some change but no. Don’t stop doing the exposures when they come to you in life.

3. Last step is pretty simple  but not easy. Don’t slow down in life: Keep doing things you been doing  if you stop them then this is avoiding things which makes you weaker and leads you into an overthinking cycle.

Conclusion: 
I have been to a couple of therapies that didn’t completely accurately do their job. But as far as I have looked  nobody has an easy guide on beating OCD anywhere online. So if my steps don’t work for you  know that it’s because a 16 year old came up with them with 0 teaching only self-research. But they work for me  and I will be seeing an OCD specialist soon to back this up. If you are struggling with OCD and lost like I was then try my stuff.

OCD,The misinformation on this sub is rampant and we should hold people accountable for it.,"I'm honestly extremely disappointed and tired of the rampant misinformation that goes on on this sub. Every day I see at least one post that spreads fear mongering information  straight up fake news or says that this THING will be the solution to everything.

Key point: **the golden standard EVIDENCE BASED method of recovering from OCD is ERP treatment and also some techniques (not all) of CBT. Also  medication. If there are comorbidities  the spectrum of possible treatments widens. For example  someone with OCD and PTSD may benefit from EMDR therapy even though it's not the golden standard for OCD. (Edit) there are other evidence based treatments for OCD that are surfacing or that have already been shown as effective. These include ACT  DBT (especially when in comorbidity with suicidaility or personality disorders)  TMS  neurofeedback and others.**

I'm not saying this to invalidate your experience with alternative methods. I'm not saying your experience isn't valid. What enrages me is when people make their experience a gospel truth  using gatekeeping phrases like **""if you don't do this you'll NEVER recover!""  ""This thing cures OCD I'm living proof of it""  ""This is THE SOLUTION to OCD"".**

There is an ocean of a difference between that and saying ""I tried this thing and it worked wonders for me  maybe it's worth a shot"". OCD is not this lighthearted topic where you can state your opinion as facts. It's one thing to do it with toppings of a pizza  it's another thing to do it with a disorder.

In my recovery journey  I found that practicing yoga  and even studying yoga philosophy helped me a lot  and I'm really into it  even the most esoteric aspects. Now  do I think yoga is the cure for OCD? No. Just because it worked for me  does that give me permission to share it as this magic potion that will heal everyone? **NO**. Can I still talk about it on here? **YES**!

Here are the most popular misinformed titles  slogans  and posts that I've seen:

1. Turn to god.
2. You need to follow this philosopher / teacher / guru's saying.
3. ERP is a scam. Rationalizing fears helps! It helped me! Cue insane theory about OCD being a good thing that makes you a superior human being to others
4. Build ""discipline"" and ""self control"" (ffs).
5. Stop masturbating  go nofap  you'll detox yourself from the bad thoughts bro trust me.
6. Don't use SSRI or ""mainstream medication""  use psychedelics because they'll free your mind (EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TAKE)
7. Yoga and eastern meditation and opening of the chakras will cleanse your spirit. OCD is a sign of chakra blockage.

I know that this is a problem that's rampant in most mental health communities  but it particularly makes me mad that it happens on this sub because **we should be well aware how much black and white thinking hurts**  yet you'll still see posts like ""if you don't do this you're not recovered""  ""you NEED to do this  it's the cure"". People with OCD already feel lost with the information they have on the disorder  why overshadow the good  legitimate information we have with your miracle cure / theory? Why lead people astray?

Again  I'm not invalidating your experience if you're part of one of the seven points (I am too). I'm condemning people who use this talking points to share misinformation and lead people to believe that that's what 100% will ""cure"" them  that that's the key they've been looking for. You can still suggest it (apart from the really dangerous advice) or talk about your experience  you're 10000% free to do so and maybe I also will in the future.

Let's make this a place a source of critical thinking  respectful sharing  not a competition of who has the true ""magic potion"". If you think there's a legitimate effective way that should be known and popularized  look up good resources on it on the internet and share them here  let's build common knowledge on this disorder based on evidence. If we use this tool of sharing for good  we'll make a great impact on this community. But if you abuse it and treat ocd recovery as this shallow  one-way matter **you'll do nothing but harm**.


EDIT: some much needed clarification. I profusely apologize for not mentioning the other evidence based modalities of therapy that exist for OCD. I sincerely forgot  I’m aware of them   I was too lost in thought and I mispoke. I wanted to say that ERP was the golden standard and instead I said it was the only option  which is just outright false. I’m very sorry",323,111,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/wjdx41/the_misinformation_on_this_sub_is_rampant_and_we/
OCD,I took a 13 hour shower...,"I have an issue leaving work without taking a shower due to anxiety about asbestos exposure.The showering affects my life greatly due to the time it takes. About half a year ago  it could take an hour to shower  and I would wash 6-8 times. Lately  it has escalated. I've managed to get the wash count down to 4 times  but everything still takes so much time. Now I'm getting stuck at different moments. It takes at least 30 minutes to apply shampoo and shower cream. Rinsing also takes at least 30 minutes  if I don't get stuck rinsing my hair for 1-3 hours before I manage to continue. The latest shower took almost 13 hours  and made my wife coming late to work. 

I also need to shower when I come home before I can sit on the sofa  lie in the bed  etc.  because I've been in the facility at work after the shower there.

This is destroying my life... 

I have tried CBT with ERP without success  and I will start medication once I finish another treatment  as the current medication interferes with this one. I will go to another private therapist who seems more experienced with OCD  and my employer will pay for it.
 
However  I NEED to shower like a normal human if I want to keep my life as it is  my partner  and my work  as they will get tired of this in the end.",116,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1ediag4/i_took_a_13_hour_shower/
OCD,Anyone else feel like OCD took their life away?,It honestly feels like I lost myself and everything I loved to OCD and depression. I can't remember a time where I didn't have OCD at this point. I gave up a majority of my hobbies because my intrusive thoughts have made it almost impossible to do anything sometimes. I'm tired. I'm so tired of everything feeling either numb or painful. It hurts  it hurts so bad and I feel like there's no end and that the rest of my life is just gonna be this endless pitch black void that I can't escape. I used to be scared  then I was sad  then I was angry  now it feels like nothing. It feels empty. OCD has made life horrible and it feels like I'll never get back to a decent point in my life.

OCD,A masterpost of what I've learned after a 4 year long battle with OCD,"I've always thought about making a post like this since so many people come on here scared  newly diagnosed and just overall understandably confused. **I don't consider myself as fully recovered  I've had a lot of ups and downs and a relapse just recently. I just feel like I gathered a ton of information and tools during these years that maybe could be helpful to share.**

**The basics of OCD**

Learning about intrusive thoughts  the OCD cycle and compulsions is the first big step. To give you a brief rundown of these 3 key concepts:

* **Intrusive thoughts.** They are thoughts (but they can also be images!) that pop up in a very unexpected way in your mind  they often cause anxiety and the content of these thoughts **scares** you or unsettles you. They are not wanted  and the content  especially with some subtypes  is egodystonic to the person that has the thought: that means that they probably think the opposite of that thought. The subject of our intrusive thoughts is something/someone we often value a lot  even if the intrusive thoughts make it seem like the opposite. There's a million example of intrusive thoughts  because we could have them about anything! They sometimes start as ""what ifs""  but they can also sound like commands  or start with ""I wants"".  A few examples (big trigger warning for   well  everything) : ""What if I hate my family and want to kill them?""  ""What if the door is unlocked and my daughter is going to get kidnapped""  ""What if I'm actually trans and have been lying to myself?""  ""Do I want to cheat on my girlfriend with a guy?""  ""I contracted AIDS but didn't realize it until now!""  ""There's definitely poison in this drink""  ""I want to break up with my boyfriend but don't have the guts to""  ""I'm a terrible person because I did X in the past  I'm disgusting""  ""What if I commited a crime that I don't remember?"". As you see  the content of these thoughts is unsettling  very polarized and often aggressive towards yourself.
* **Compulsions.** When we have these intrusive thoughts  we really feel a need to calm down because they hit you in an unexplainable  horrible way. The first automatic response is to **ruminate** as a way to make sure that the thought is wrong  and that's the main compulsion that we all. Let's take the first of the examples. You'd probably start thinking ""What? NO! I love my family  I went on vacation with them a week ago  we had so much fun  they're the most important people in my life"" and on and on. The problem is that by doing this you're actually feeding the OCD  that would probably respond to you with other intrusive thoughts  like ""Well  you fight often with your mom. Who says you won't lose control one day and do it?"". That is going to scare you even further and ruminate even further. Some people just ruminate as a compulsion  but many others have other compulsion that give you  for an extremely brief period of time  some relief from the anxiety. There are a million compulsions and they're often specific to the subtype : people with ROCD check their feelings with their SO or ""test"" their attraction  people with checking OCD go back and check the locks   people with contamination OCD wash their hands / bedding / furniture  people with false memory OCD check for evidence. There's also people who count  touch specific surfaces  pray  do a specific action with their body  say a specific things... there's a world of compulsions. As you can see  there are physical compulsions and ""purely mental"" compulsions. And even if you don't do any of these things  you still do the main compulsions that is common to all of us: rumination. What you need to know is that while compulsions make you feel okay for 5 minutes  you'll go back to feeling anxious again if not worse. The more you do those compulsions  the more you get stuck in the cycle and feel extremely scared if you don't do them.
* **The OCD cycle.** You get the intrusive thought --> you feel scared /unsettled by it --> you feel like you need to ruminate or do any other compulsion to feel okay --> you give in to the compulsion --> brief relief --> you feel even more scared and unsettled.
* **How do I get unstuck?** By refraining from doing any compulsion  by sitting with the anxiety of the thought but not do anything about it. Ride the wave of the anxiety and of the uncertainty. Respond with ""I don't know  we'll see""  ""It could be  who knows""  ""Maybe!"" and then don't ruminate any further. This is what you practice in ERP and CBT therapy.

**The basics of starting recovery and what is helpful**

* **CBT therapy and ERP**. When I started showing symptoms I was in talk therapy  and it made my OCD 10000 times worse. This therapist had almost no knowledge on what was effective for OCD and instead tried to connect everything to my past  which was useful in some way but didn't do anything to help me practically with compulsions  intrusive thoughts etc. If you have even the slightest doubt about having OCD or not  always see an OCD therapist or at least a CBT based one.
* **Self administered ERP**. I had some moments in these years where I wasn't seeing a therapist for multiple reasons  so I relied on ERP by myself with the NOCD app and it really did help a lot. Of course  it's always going to be more effective with a therapist but it definitely helped keep me afloat.
* **Keeping your health in check.** I think it's extremely important to realize what stressors in your life trigger an OCD episode the most. For example  I know that for a lot of people having their eating schedule messed up really triggers them. For me  it's sleep. If I sleep even an hour less than 8 hours I will be a mess all day long. Fighting OCD is hard as fuck. Don't make it harder for yourself by not sleeping well  not getting exercise  and in general neglecting your health.
* **Trying your hardest not to seek reassurance.** You've probably heard this word being thrown around a lot here. It sounds just logical to seek reassurance when you have doubts  the thing is that reassurance for people with OCD is like heroin. It gives you that very short but strong ""hit""  and then you need more and more to be okay. The problem is that  just like a drug  OCD can never get enough of reassurance. The more you ask for it  the more you feel like you need to ask more because OCD needs you to be 1000% sure about your worry  and that's an impossible goal to reach. This WILL have an impact on your relationships and friendships. A lot of people  in an attempt to avoid seeking reassurance from their loved ones  they come on here to ask for it but it's just as harmful!

**Some more things that have personally helped**

* **Working on my trauma**. OCD can be a trauma response in relation to some core belief you have about yourself. In my case  my core beliefs are that I am not trustworthy and I am in general   a very flawed and idiotic person  so my instincts and choices are always going to be wrong. OCD ""helps"" me feel a fake sense of certainty around things that worry me. When I hand over my life choices to OCD I feel safer because I don't have to take that risk of making my own personal decisions  because I see them as inherently stupid.
* **Exercise.** I know that when you're at your lowest with OCD the last thing you want to do is to move and sweat and feel more tired than you already feel. But it works  trust me. You really need to try it and stick to it a few times to really feel it. It gets you out of your head  it makes you feel lighter  it clears your head even if just for a moment  and it helps with serotonin levels.
* **Adopting some life philosophy principles.** Even if I've been diagnosed only for 4 years  I've had OCD for almost all of my life. And that shapes your views on life. My therapist helped me realized that I think that there is always an objective truth  that letting go of control means things always going south  that there's just black and white   and that if you aren't certain about something and still live your life regardless you're a bad person. I had to unlearn all of these things plus more  for example the fact that I have such a hard time trusting my decisions. I think trying to reshape the way you view life and unlearning all of these ideals that stem from OCD can have a very important impact on your recovery. You can be extremely good at dealing with intrusive thoughts  but if at your core you still believe that there can be 1000% certainty about everything that will really halt you. This will also really help when you face relapses  because it will give you that security of having solid principles that show why OCD is always wrong.
* **Having a solid support network.** This doesn't mean that you need to explain or tell about your diagnosis to everyone  especially when we know how many people know nothing about OCD and is also so very stigmatized. But having a social outlet can be extremely helpful  because OCD thrives in isolation. Just being in the presence of a loved one  doing outdoor activities together can really have a positive impact.
* **Connecting with people here in these subs.** A lot of people just use these subs to seek reassurance  but it can be a great place to connect with people that have our same struggles in a way that's not reassurance-seeking. Sharing our stories  listening to other people's experiences really makes you feel not alone. Also  trying to help people that post here really gives me insight on how to deal with my own struggles. It's always easier to help someone else rather than ourselves  so you can use that to really resonate around OCD in a way that's less anxiety inducing compared to when you need to deal with your own thoughts.

**Around ROCD (one of my main themes)**

* Your partner is a human. If you let ROCD run rampant in your relationship  if you confess a lot  if you break up as a compulsion  if you lash out and get aggressive because of intrusive thoughts you will hurt your partner a lot. A lot a lot. I empathize with you because I've been there multiple times  but we really need to make the effort not to bleed on the other person because of our wounds.
* Make a list of all the feelings that you think are wrong to feel in a relationship. A lot of common ones are boredom  irritation  anger. Try and make and effort to sit with those feelings instead of doing something about it. Make them part of your love life  not a deranged mistake that you make.
* Relationships are complex and OCD wants you to have 100000% certainty on a part of your life that can never be that certain. The difference between you and other people in a relationship is not that they are 1000% certain  it's that they are okay with that 1% uncertainty.

**Some other things that I think are generally helpful**

* **Stay the hell away from advice subs.** I made a whole post on it but you can probably guess why it's so bad for you.
* **Mindfulness activities.** I think these can be great once you're in a more stable place as they can be very triggering  because they make you much more aware of your intrusive thoughts. I've done the headspace course on anxiety once or twice and loved it. There's a lot of ways to meditate: being in nature and walking in silence  ""traditional"" eyes-closed meditation  meditative yoga etc.
* **Work on every other comorbidity you may have.** If you have more than one mental disorder  one may trigger the other and it can be a very frustrating experience. Even if you're fully recovered from OCD  being in the trenches with  say  an eating disorder makes it really hard for you not to relapse with OCD.
* **Cut social media time in half.** Or cut it off completely if you manage to. Mindlessly scrolling when you have OCD can be a legit DRUG. It makes you numb and it muffles the intrusive thoughts' noise. At one point my phone usage was 11 hours. It makes you stressed  anxious  feel less than  can give your brain fog... essentially the perfect mix for an OCD flare up.
* **Be consistent with therapy.** I think this point is so important. Even once you are recovered  it's still so crucial to go to therapy  even monthly is okay. My worst relapse happened because I could feel myself getting worse but I had been out of therapy for months and didn't want to admit to myself that I needed help again. Having that session every X days helps you check in yourself and catch relapses before they snowball.
* **Avoid confessing.** I know OCD makes it seem only logical to tell your SO /family /friends about your intrusive thoughts so that you do the ""right"" thing and tell them ""the truth"". This only impacts negatively your relationships. Telling everyone each of your intrusive thoughts only makes you feel better for 3 seconds and has no real use in your life unless you're telling them to a therapist. It can lead you to really hurt your loved ones feelings  for example with ROCD. Your partner can feel very hurt listening to the intrusive thoughts  even if they have no meaning.
* **Live your life.** I'd like to conclude on this note. OCD makes you feel like you have a massive obstacle in life and that doing ""big"" things can be too much of a risk. Challenge that. Go on trips  make experiences  try a million hobbies and meet a million people  live your life to the best you can even if there's OCD. Bring it along for the ride. And that's because you have two choices : either agreeing with OCD and give up on your life  or bring the fucker with you for the ride. Having a life full of things to do is a much greater enemy to OCD.

**What I think about the most popular accounts on OCD**

* Mark Freeman - not a therapist but has never claimed to be one. He gives great advice that is based on evidence  his videos are super entertaining to the point that I was following him out of curiosity rather than a need to deal with my OCD. He can explain extremely complex subjects in a very simple way and I think that’s an absolute gift.
* Anxietyjosh - Really like him. I don’t particularly enjoy his format per se  the kind of account that posts a million tweets with these truth nuggets that are of course very heplful  but it gives a lot of chaotic energy lol.
* OCDrecoveryuk - Just no. He’s a scammer and has in general proved to be a very sketchy guy all around. If you want to know more  try to search his name in this sub   the story is way too long for me to write it here.
* NOCD - I know that there are very mixed reviews about their therapy services but I never tried them so I can’t say. I found the app to be very helpful  it’s very nice to have your own app with erp exercises  community threads  SOS support etc. I’m really interested to try one of their support groups in the near future.
* Awaken into love - This is a very hard one for me. On one hand  this is one of the first  if not the first channel  that brought awareness around ROCD and I know so many people in this community will be forever grateful for that. My problem with her is that even if she’s never far off with her explaining of OCD  I find that her solutions are a little odd. It seems like she often transforms OCD from an individual problem to a couples problem and I think that’s a little dangerous. She talks a lot about deepening connections  opening up more  putting the work in your relationship and that’s awesome  but it’s not really the point to me when it comes to OCD. OCD is an individual problem  it’s not a problem of the couple. Don’t get me wrong  everythings she says I think it’s 100% spot on and it’s wisdom everyone should reflect on. But all of this talk around relationship hardships to me relates more to relationship anxiety…?
* Obsessivelyeverafter - certified therapist with a past with OCD. Love her  honest and trasparent and isn’t afraid to show the dark parts of OCD.
* Youranxietytoolkit - OCD specialist on ig. Recommended!
* Sheeva Rajee (shrinkwrap) : another big name regarding ROCD. I feel like she’s more focused on CBT  ERP based recovery than Kiyomi . I feel like she balances the wisdom part around relationships in general and knowledge around OCD well. I haven’t read her book yet but I’ve heard fantastic things.

Other accounts I really like: OCD and Anxiety on youtube  theocdstories podcast  jenna overbaugh  ocdoodles  ocdexcellence  anxiouslovecoach

EDIT: I'm going to add a few things that were brought up in the comments that were really good points  as well as some other things I wanted to add.

**What about medication?** Medication can be great and very effective for OCD. I 100% think that if you want to go on medication you should also pair it with therapy   in fact it's the standard advice that professionals give  but medication can really help you not hit extreme lows. I personally just have a benzodiazepine that I use when I have severe anxiety  I initially wanted to go on medication but I have a few other meds that I'm on for other health conditions that are already giving me side effects  so the worry was that mixing them would cause more harm than good. However  if I ever feel like the benefits would be higher than the ""risks"" I'd gladly take them. I also think you can recover without meds! They are an awesome tool  and it's your choice wether to use it or not. If you are on the fence about this  your therapist or family doctor can help you.

**What if I can't afford therapy?** This is  sadly  the case for many. I also had to stop for a while because of the cost and going back made me feel extremely guilty and anxious about the financial side of it. Given that mental health shouldn't be a luxury and it's beyond cruel that to get the right treatment you have to pay unspeakable amounts of money  there are some options.

1. First of all  look up if there is any kind of sliding scale / free limited sessions program in your country. This varies a lot from place to place.
2. Secondly  we luckily have a lot of books that were written by therapists or fellow sufferers that are absolute gems and that walk you through your OCD recovery. I'll put a list of my favourites below. I have read a lot of them especially when I wasn't in therapy and they are amazing  I now use them as reminders whenever I feel worse  because they condense a million things on OCD in very simple explanations.
3. Support groups. There are online support groups popping up everywhere nowadays! NOCD has a lot of support groups for a lot of OCD subtypes.
4. The NOCD app. Like I said in my first points  you can self administer ERP if you don't have a very hard time with it. I'd **definitely** avoid it if it triggers you to the point of not functioning or wanting to harm yourself   but if it triggers your anxiety in a ""reasonable"" amount   I'd say go for it. They have this ERP exercise layout that is super cool and that makes you track your progress. They also have some resources to help you during a crisis and a community chatroom.

OCD,Is this theme even real?,"I’ve been dealing with what I think is tocd(gender identity) for the past 3 months or so….I would give anything to go back to how it was the day before I had that first thought. 

My experience has been absolute hell on earth  by far the worst theme I have ever dealt with. But the thing is  around 3 or so weeks ago  the dread  the anxiety  the distress  the depression  everything else…just stopped? Yet  the thoughts remain and while I still find myself doing compulsions I just don’t feel anxiety anymore…im very scared I’m actually just questioning or something and I’m going to start to hate being me..(a man)…Im scared that I’m actually just in denial and don’t know it…wouldn’t I have known this or thought of this a long time ago if I really wanted that?…..I just feel very lost and like any sense of self I had has been slipping away from me over the past months….i know it sounds bad and I don’t want to be rude to people who may be suffering with other themes but I wish I could go back to being convinced I had AIDS or Multiple Sclerosis….in fact I would rather have those than stop being me…I don’t want this to come across as reassurance seeking because my posts keep getting removed for it….im just very tired and scared…

Sometimes I wonder if myself and everyone else suffering from this are actually just in denial

OCD,Nobody knows or cares about OCD  even is super “mental health aware” spaces,"Through some funny circumstances (no it wasn’t meeting in support groups or inpatient) most of my friends are in contact with psychiatry somehow. I am both offline and online in crowds where talking about mental health is just very normal. It’s such a nice and open space. Borderline  bipolar  schizophrenia  schizotypy  PTSD  self h@rm  addiction  ADHD or autism  eating disorders  of course depression and anxiety… but never OCD. People don’t seem to get it  even here. People don’t understand it and its symptoms are so ugly  disgusting and alien to people (it would take my hours to explain what an intrusive thought in pure-O even really is)  that I’ve found that no non-therapist or non-sufferer can really give you any advice.

We were living with distant family for some time and my boyfriend wanted to empathetically “”warn”” the host that I could sometimes be a bit quiet etc  and he explained this as me having “anxiety”. Instant understanding. Saying OCD would’ve required a lesson. 

I know this is honestly stupid and maybe defining myself by an illness too much  and I wouldn’t wish this disorder on anyone; but sometimes I just wish this shit had community. It’s a lonely disorder.

OCD,can you get pregnant from semen on toilet paper,"so  i think i may have had an accident  im not sure but its worrying me  i think i mightve ejaculated in my sleep  but it was dried up and when i went to the bathroom i touched a bunch of stuff with my ""infected??"" hand of semen im not too sure if there was on my hand or it mightve been dried but say it wasnt dried and i touched the toilet paper and im scared someone would get pregnant by using the toilet paper so i rolled off as much toilet paper as possible but not too much so it would waste the whole role of toilet paper and about 40 minutes later someone used the bathroom. help please is someone gonna get pregnant??


UPDATE: i thought about this post earlier today and thought i would clarify what happened a bit more. i may have overexaggerated  there was no white gooey stuff on my hand (i wanted to make that clear) but the reason i was stressing was because i had just taken a piss and was scared because i had just woken up and my im not sure at all if it was a wet dream i had  cant remember  but i do remember i was trying really hard to be careful of what i touched and with which hand i used to touch stuff  (because i didnt want the ""infected"" hand anywhere near anything).  i've realised how stupid of a question this was  i posted it out of stress and scared.

i wanted to make this update just to clarify and also just because i'm always scared of people not understanding my initial post  reason for overexaggeration was because i wanted to know of if there was a possibility of pregnancy even at the lowest possible outcome. (i dont know if that makes sense) but nobodys pregnant so you all were right

thank you for all the advice and responses  i did post this on another subreddit so i just wanted to edit both thanx all",208,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1ar9ews/can_you_get_pregnant_from_semen_on_toilet_paper/
OCD,It gets so much better,"Today I realized I haven’t looked at this sub in about 2 years and wanted to make a quick post to say… it gets so much better. 

From 2018 - 2022 OCD ruled my life. My themes generally focused on Harm OCD  Health anxiety and the absolute undefined worst theme Existential OCD. Occasionally I would slip into other themes so I’ve experienced it all. 

I ruined 2 relationships by constantly seeking reassurance and being crippled by fear. I was a broken man and wasn’t optimistic about my future at all. 

Fast forward to today and I almost feel normal again. I’m happy  I’m not controlled by OCD anymore  I’m confident and I’m optimistic about the future. 

If you’re struggling just know  it gets so much better.

Here’s what I did to get to this point.
1. Find a therapist that understands OCD and begin ERP. If you are in the US I found mine through psychology today and filtered by OCD. Call them and talk to them before you purchase a session  make sure it’s a fit. This is expensive  I drained my savings and worked odd jobs to afford treatment but it’s an investment that will literally change your life. Make the sacrifice if you can.
2. Educate yourself on OCD through books and podcasts.
3. Exercise
4. Work on yourself. Get in a routine. Much of my anxiety came from a deep disappointment in myself for the decisions I was making. When I changed my habits and switched to a more suitable career a lot of that weight was lifted from me. 
5. Get off this sub when you establish care. Nobody healed is on here.
6. Seek discomfort. If you’re triggered sit in that fear   don’t look for reassurance. 
7. Eat healthy. Not OCD related but you’ll feel better. 

It’s going to be ok :)",229,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1etb23t/it_gets_so_much_better/
OCD,You are badass,"Living with OCD is tough  and you are a fucking badass for dealing with it.

I don’t care what your compulsions look like  I don’t care how embarrassing you think it is  and I don’t care if it makes you feel uncool because the fact is you are fighting a gruesome battle where the only way out is by subjecting yourself to your biggest fears. If that isn’t badass  I don’t know what is.

I’ll be the first to admit  sometimes I feel pathetic because of my OCD. The trivial things that I can’t do because of it make me feel so lame.

But at the end of the day I have to remember that I’m living with a brain that is actively fighting against me. Nobody in my life will be able to comprehend what that is like. The self discipline I’ve learned in ERP has truly shaped the person I am today. While I’m inhibited in many things because of my OCD  I’ve learned to be courageous in other ways because honestly when you deal with OCD the normal problems get easier. I asked out the girl I liked  I answer questions in class  I talk to people unprompted now. OCD has taught me that fear is just a feeling that needs to be challenged.

To everyone else with OCD  I see you. I see how hard you’re working  and I want you to know that I truly believe you are one of the toughest motherfuckers on the planet.",90,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1gq3uol/you_are_badass/
OCD,Low post engagement might be partially linked to our OCD - now I want to support in comments more than I post on here ,"So…I did a non-reassurance-seeking post earlier asking a general question and got no-to-little engagement  and not much in response. Felt a bit dejected after no responses. Possibly some of you have felt similarly when you posted and taken it as a “sign” even - glass half empty/ nobody cares?

But I looked at the history and most posts are low to no engagement and I realised why. I came on here to post about my own OCD and get help; I didn’t come here to talk about the condition from other’s perspectives; it made me realise that a lot of us have a tunnel-vision urgency in our minds when we post - maybe we want to get reassurance or a answer urgently - so I am making myself a promise that I really want to keep.

OCD,So grateful for this community - I just got diagnosed and for once don’t feel so alone and ashamed,"Im officially diagnosed! I’ve been insanely anxious my psychiatrist wouldn’t believe my symptoms because I haven’t really brought them up before due to shame. But it went so well! I’ve always wrote off my intrusive thoughts as “anxiety” which has always been my normal  and never really elaborated further. I realize i really kept my psychiatrist and therapist in the dark about what was really going on in my mind  never giving the full truth. 

Now that I’ve figured this out I can now share all these parts of me with them and really get the help I need  it feels like opening a door that’s been deadlocked my whole life. Both of them have apologized for missing it. Which I told them I don’t blame them at all because I never opened up about it all.

I’m so grateful to have this community  I finally feel so seen  understood  and not alone. This is such an isolating disorder and no one else truly understands how debilitating it is.

OCD,ocd and bulimia  I feel so alone,"I have severe ocd and bulimia nervosa. my ocd reinforces my bulimia like crazy. this might sound weird but one of my strongest compulsions is related to my bulimia. for example  when I’m vomiting  my brain says stuff like: “you have to gag x amount of times in intervals of x  and only then will you be completely clean on the inside. If ur not completely clean on the inside you can’t leave the bathroom” 

I’ve literally never NOT done this when it popped in my head and it’s so exhausting every time. I’ve had to gag over 100 times before and it’s so exhausting. I’ve been doing it for over 5 years now and I’m tired 

even right now my ocd is latching onto this post I’m writing. telling me it will post to my other account or link to my instagram or a family member will see it. all of those are illogical and I KNOW that but I’m still worried.

I havent been active these past months. So much has happened.
I was getting better. I was soaring through life happy with friends. But i noticed these pockets of sadness that would creep in when i was left to my thoughts for long.
I have always been insecure of my body so i started going to the gym. Ive lost 10 pounds since starting last month. I have also been in summer courses. Sometimes its becomes too much.
I hang out wirh friends and I started getting closer to my extended family.
But i still feel alone. My OCD feels much mlre moral and emotional based.
Im scared ive said the wrong things or that ive scared my friends away. I stopped my antidepressants cold turkey  i drink until i blackout  I crave being asleep. I dont drink daily (maybe every other week). But i feel so alone yet having people around me.

Prior to having severe OCD  making friends felt difficult and I was already isolated but still had connections with others and felt there were multiple people I could reach out to to spend time with. Now there's really no one and the OCD fear  on top of social anxiety  on top of just not knowing how to make friends when I don't feel like myself is like living in hell.

OCD,Effective and minimally harmful ways to self-medicate?,A bit of an odd question  but I feel that if I had some way to self-medicate I would be able to manage much more effectively. I have a bit of OCD about taking substances which has made me avoid experimenting with substances etc to self-medicate. At this point I think if (for example) smoked a pack of cigarettes a week it would be a lot less detrimental to my health than the psychological and physiological toll that OCD and the corresponding stress takes. ,7,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1j3mrbk/effective_and_minimally_harmful_ways_to/
OCD,I feel like I’m living in a nightmare (TW- vague self harm and psychosis mention),"I (20f) was under the treatment of a public health team for my psychosis  panic disorder and OCD for four years  and have recently been discharged with a referral to a different team because I was with them for too long at that point. 

I haven’t seen a psychologist or psychiatrist for about 2 months now and my OCD has been getting worse and worse despite being on 250mg of clomipromine. I’m hoping to see someone soon but there’s a waitlist. 

I’m falling behind with uni  and I spend every waking moment doing compulsions or trying to resist them. They have become physically harmful and the damage is noticeable. I can’t bring myself to care about it though or the impacts it’s having on my life. All I want to do is perform these compulsions  and at the same time all I want to do is stop thinking about it. 

I don’t want to involve my family because I’m so scared that I’ll be admitted to hospital again or they’ll say I can’t live on my own anymore and have to be under someone else’s care. I genuinely do not think I could tolerate being alive under those circumstances again  I am so scared of losing everything I’ve built since my last episodes of psychosis but I’m so scared and I can feel it creeping in. 

I don’t want to tell anyone how bad I feel because I don’t want to scare them or make them think I’m a danger to myself or anyone else. I know reassurance seeking is bad but I just need someone to tell me I’ll be okay and that I’m not going crazy again.

OCD,People with self harm OCD who are also depressed. How to deal with this compulsion? More in the comments.,"Example: I'm scrolling YouTube and I see a video from a doctor related to self harm (I'm not even gonna write the word because it makes really scarred)  I click on ""hide this"" or something. So there's definitely a compulsion there. Why? Because I am afraid of myself  of harming myself. 

I see someone taking their life on a movie  I look away. The same goes with other themes. But this one is really scary. I just want to be a better person and improve my life. I'm trying and I know I've got this.

I should say that I don't want to do nothing of the sort at all. It's not real ideation. They're thoughts. At the same time  OCD uses my depression to get leverage. I'm having a hard time in life. I've been taking Clomipramine (50 mg)  and Luvox (50 mg). I will see my analyst today and tomorrow I'll see my psychiatrist to see if we'll change something in the meds. 

So  the next time I see a video I should just ignore it  should I watch it? Maybe just don't click on hide.

OCD,Dealing with Self-Harm OCD – Anyone Else Feel Like They’ll Lose Control? ,"Hey everyone 

I’ve been struggling with self-harm OCD  and one of the hardest parts is the fear that I might lose control or have a psychotic breakdown one day. The intrusive thoughts are relentless  and even though I know they’re not a reflection of who I am  the “what if” scenarios can feel so real and overwhelming.

I’m curious—how many of you experience these fears too? How do you remind yourself that you’re still in control even when your mind is screaming otherwise?

Would love to hear your experiences or tips for coping. It’s comforting to know we’re not alone in this.

OCD,False memory/real event with self harm OCD ,"Hello everyone. I am going through a really difficult time with my main two OCD types right now  which is false memory OCD together with self harm OCD. I constantly think I am capable of harming myself and then not remembering exactly the details.

It all started with a very bad bout of food poisoning in 2021. At that time I didn't have OCD  but after a traumatic recovery period from the illness I developed cross contamination OCD  the sort of ""standard"" washing your hands all the time and cleaning everything and minimising cross contamination type of OCD. My central theme is about ensuring that I never get a stomach bug ever again  so basically I am scared of a gastro infection.

But unfortunately now it developed even further. It started with doubting distances  like the distance from my face to dirty objects. I started mistrusting my abilities to move normally without touching anything dirty off my lips  because my main fear is if something gets on my lips then I will eventually lick my lips and it will get inside. Now I get vivid intrusive imaginations of how I touch dirty objects with my lips  for example puddles or bins outside. This causes me to have false memories. When I come home  I start doubting if I definitely didn't touch something dirty with my lips while I was shopping or out on a walk because I can't remember every second precisely.

Life has become hell for me and I am really looking for some support if someone has encountered this problem before. Maybe someone could recommend me something or an online psychologist who specialises in such cases? I am at a loss right now and I really need help. Thank you for reading this. I can explain further in the comments if necessary  I tried to keep it brief and to the point here  but I have a lot of other details.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1hiw7v3/false_memoryreal_event_with_self_harm_ocd/

OCD,My brother has severe scrupulosity OCD and I don't know how to help (TW Self-harm),"My brother doesn't have a diagnosis but scrupulosity  is the closest term I've found to describe this. We are Christians and he beleives that every day he draws farther from God becaue of his drifting thoughts. He gets very frustrated with himself and often ends up hitting himself (with blunt objects) on his head  face  or thigh  and crying in his room. I'm his older sister and I don't know what to do. He's unreceptive to any differing opinions  and he has a hard time expressing his own arguments  which just makes him angrier at himself. There have been many times where I've lost my patience and said things I know I shouldn't but I just don't know how to get through to him. When I tell him self-harm is bad and not sustainable as a way of refocusing himself  he says he doesn't care and it's the only thing that works. I try to be reassuring and uplifting but he hates that even more and rejects anybody saying anything positive about him. He thinks he's ""stupid"" and called himself the r-slur all the time. I feel like every time I try to stop him or talk to him he leaves more agitated than he was before. When my parents talk to him it devolves into a screaming-fest and that freaks *me* out. They've tried doctors and psychologists but it's expensive and he isn't open to getting help and uncooperative in talk-therapy. He feels like he doesn't have a say in what happens to him but when left alone he only hurts himself. I don't know how to support him.

OCD,My heart breaks for everyone who suffers from OCD. This is a rest stop  take a hug.,"Hey  take a seat  take some hot coffee or tea or whatever you like  and just give yourself a breather for once. Even if it‘s just for the time being of reading this post. 

My heart breaks for each and every single one of you. Myself included. It‘s not your fault  you‘re not a bad person. You don‘t need to carry this guilt. You have nothing to be afraid of  i promise. You are capable  and i‘m so proud of you for not giving up. 

It‘s easy to forget what this disorder is actually doing to us  because we are so focused on our worries  fears  and the consequences that OCD tells us comes with not worrying about it. OCD is so vile and wretched  it tricks us into spending all this time and energy on preventing our worst fears. It tricks us into thinking we are evil and heartless if we dont  that it‘s our fault and therefore we must sacrifice our entire life bending to it‘s rules. That is the exact goal of this disorder  it makes it possible so we don‘t realize what kind of actual torture we are putting ourselves through. If we never come to see the gravity of that  we will keep obeying  keep allowing OCD‘s grasp of control. That way we will never break free. 

Meanwhile what is ACTUALLY happening  is that you  my dear fellow soul  are destroying yourself. You are robbing yourself of your own life slowly. You are abandoning yourself a little bit every time you trust OCD‘s words more  than your own.

I know it‘s hard to not fall into believing OCD‘s lies  and I know it feels so real. I know you‘re afraid. I am too. But if i can give you one thing on your journey.. remember all of this is the only thing that allows OCD to keep you in the cycle. View OCD as a toxic partner if it helps you. OCD is manipulating you constantly so you keep being too afraid to set boundaries and cut the toxicity out of your life. to keep you controlled. 

Your wellbeing  YOU as a person  YOUR life  is more important than whatever OCD is telling you. Allow yourself to let go. You don‘t need to solve your obession. You don‘t need to figure it out. I promise it‘s possible to feel better WITHOUT knowing. It‘s possible to get your life back my dear. ERP helps and is gonna be your best starting point. I believe in you. Don‘t give up on yourself  you deserve to live and experience joy without guilt and fear. ",786,163,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1ftj88m/my_heart_breaks_for_everyone_who_suffers_from_ocd/
OCD,I have increasingly cut out foods due to contamination OCD and now I'm down to only three things that I can force myself to eat.,"I have previously posted about severe anxiety that I experience with my partner  but after seeing a similar post on the front page today I wanted to reach out to try to find others like me. 

Over the past year  I have severely reduced the foods that I eat. I am convinced that there is contamination of some sort in everything I buy from the store. I have gradually decreased what I am comfortable buying and at this point I’m down to three things I eat…canola oil  rice  and cow milk. I have become completely dependent on my partner to cook me rice because I don’t have any energy to go out and buy anything or do things myself. I can barely walk around our condo and I don’t know how much longer I can live like this. I am in therapy for my OCD but I don’t think my therapist believes that I am truly limiting my diet so much. My partner tried to get my into inpatient facilities in our city but they told us that it wasn’t that serious and that I would be admitted when I attempted suicide.

OCD,Why did I cut myself? (Repost),"I (14M) cut myself for the second time. 

When I first did I felt a terrible amount of emotions mixed together.

But I have no idea why I did it a second time. Granted I felt terrible earlier  but in the moment  I was fine. I just kinda looked at my draw and thought ""I could do it right now."" 

I felt good for like 10 seconds but now I feel worse. Now I'm scared I'm doing it for attention  which I'm pretty sure it's not my goal  though I don't even know myself. 

I have terrible sexual thoughts and am going to therapy in a few days.

OCD,I cut myself (nothing serious) in the middle of an argument on the phone,"

Sorry if this is badly written  english is not my native language 

I'm 18  at 14 I started cutting myself for reasons involving depression  that stopped for a while (like until I was 16) and last year I did it again  but not in a compulsive way as before  but in the middle of a stress and anxiety crisis. I was diagnosed with OCD a few months ago  and I can't stop thinking that I'm going to hurt someone or that I can't meet my niece because I'll be a threat. I've had a couple of crises that ended in dissociation  and I was irresponsibly prescribed medication (without seeing me in the office  without talking to me  just assuming what was wrong with me) that  because it wasn't for this disorder  didn't do me any good  so I'm trying to continue without medication for the time being. 

Yesterday I wrote to a ""friend"" to listen to me for a few moments  because it had not been a good day in almost any way  this ""friend"" hates my current partner at worrying levels (when in fact he is the person who has helped me the most up to now) and as soon as I mentioned him  he started to say things like ""you are like this because you refuse to progress"" or ""I am surprised that after all this time you don't even try to get better"" when I really have left everything to go on with my life without falling into constant denial. I asked him to stop  I assumed that he didn't know well what was happening to me and what those words were going to do to me  he just kept saying those kinds of things  I was already in a state of absolute crisis  everything he said had an echo in my head that never stopped  I grabbed a blade that was on my work table and cut into my leg  I didn't tune in  it was a scratch  and immediately I became aware of what I was doing and I started to cry (more). 

Now there's no way that I don't think that I can hurt someone else  that I can be really dangerous  I don't know what to do  I'm afraid to go near my boyfriend  I'm afraid to think about having my niece near me  I'm afraid to go into the kitchen  because if I was able to grab the blade  nothing assures me that I won't be able to lose control...",2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/i92kx4/i_cut_myself_nothing_serious_in_the_middle_of_an/
OCD,Could the fixation for wanting to cut myself for spiritual protection possibly be tied to OCD?,"Previously diagnosed as bipolar II. A few years later I was not seeking help and had a tough episode where I was suicidal and explosively argumentative. I was doing poorly at my job due to the state I was in. I had started reading Aleister Crowley a lot and praying to Satan to save my job. Used a pocket knife to carve a pentagram in my stomach to protect me from losing my job. 

Then I suddenly moved to a new town and started a new job.

Never told a doctor about that bad episode before. Mainly because I feel embarrassed by my behavior from that episode.  

Anyways  does that sound like psychosis or an obsession?",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/jhmm1x/could_the_fixation_for_wanting_to_cut_myself_for/

OCD,Husband's OCD is Ruining my Personality & Marriage ,"I'm posting this because I've been feeling isolated in these problems and I want to hear from those who have been in a similar situation while being in a long successful marriage. I have seeked counseling. 
I posted a similar thread on a marriage page but those who have commented I don't think are *actually* dealing with someone with severe OCD issues. 

So my spouse of 14 years- marriage for 12 has been on the fence about getting a divorce for the past 3 years. The last 2 years have been our worst yet. 💔 The OCD tendencies weren't as bad in the beginning and middle of the marriage. 

So he tells me that I'm 100% the problem but sometimes I wonder if what he is saying is accurate enough for me to fix what I'm doing and put in the effort to make this work because he is clearly emotionally checked out and refuses to go to couples counseling.

First off: I think he has undiagnosed OCD and it's been effective my mental health and our dynamic. NOTE: I'm not asking I'd he has it or why kind it is** I know he will have to help himself for that. 

 He explained to me that his cleaning and routines are a coping mechanism because hes gets anxiety and stress sometimes from childhood trauma and must control something. Sometimes I think he is gas lighting me into believing I'm not doing enough and I'm messy which is why he must clean tot he extent he does.

 *He said he spoke about this to his therapist in the past and she said is was perfectly normal and healthy and that I should respect it and support it with all my being. 

He is very particular about his cleaning routines and where objects are placed  our habits  our lifestyle  and everything under the sun that can be controlled. The things that upset me the most is that we aren't allowed to cook in the kitchen. Since moving into our new home he has forbade the use of it at all. He bought a microwave to put in *my  bedroom* for us to only make microwaveable meals and fruit (we have 2 separate bedrooms because he wants to control the cleanliness of his sleeping space). I'm not allowed to touch the fridge or freezer and he has to set up and move every meal. 

During every meal  regardless of how careful I am I feel like I'm treated like a child who is a very messy disorganized eater. I never feel happy enough anymore to be myself. 

After years of putting up with this  my patience is starting to run thin and I've been developing a negative tone that I'm not proud of that I don't even know I'm doing sometimes. He tells me that this tone is what is turning him less and less interested in me.
I have also been making this negative faces that have been changing the appearance of my face that he constantly tells me about which has happened over the past year. 

I have turned into someone who is always anticipating criticism or a critique for the smallest thing everyday people do. 

We eat in my bedroom because that is considered his uncontrolled zone. We eat on the floor and use 50 Napkins to eat on and if one crumb touched the napkin he goes into a lecture of how I'm not careful enough regardless of the floor getting vacuumed immediately after. 

I'm not allowed to touch certain light switches  go in certain rooms  or go through certain entrances in the home because he will lose it and go into a frenzy manic episode and clean for days. He will clean things that weren't even touch or within reach. He's always super wary of me moving through the house with a bag of groceries and constantly tells me to not touch the wall with the bags even though I swear I don't. 

Also  we aren't allowed to have guests over. It's effecting my social life because I'm embarrassed of explaining to friends why they can't come over. The maintenance people have to come in the house once a year to check the alarms and other things. Every year he throws a complete fit when they walk around  touch light switches  touch door knobs  surfaces you name it regardless of explaining to them where not to go or not to touch or how to navigate the home. If I don't excitedly seem to want to clean every inch of the home right after he lectures me how I'm not a good wife and I am a pig who would be comfortable living like this.. etc. 

I happily will entertain his cleaning routines for the most part but I'm starting to realize that it never seems good enough regardless how much effort I put in. And if I don't seem positive enough doing so he will hold it over my head. 

He has also locked 2 of the 3 bathrooms of the 3 I have because he doesn't want us using them to cut down on his cleaning time yet again gets mad if one hair has been left of the floor after I come out  ect. 
I don't even brush my hair in the house anymore. 

Those who have dealt with this-- what can I do to lessen this  cleanliness struggle with him? I try to set boundaries but by doing this I just get criticism and told that I'm just looking for the lazy way out to not clean or do the steps he takes to keep the house like a museum on display. 

He's cleaning is getting so bad the paint is chipping from the walls and the electric went out twice in his room from getting soapy water in the light switch- which he freaked out over and got mad-  but I warned him that his cleaning is an issue and it's ruining the home. 

Also note every home I pay entirely for and is in my name if that helps to show the true frustration of this picture.

I've been crying alot because of these reasons and he constantly asserts he does not have OCD and he just likes a clean home. He absolutely refuses to take meds  stop his routines  or give any leeway. 

He has many other good qualities too which I why I'm having trouble completely leaving the marriage and some of his good qualities I guess you could say make up for his short comings. 

 Has anyone been through this? ",57,128,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1c1kjn1/husbands_ocd_is_ruining_my_personality_marriage/
OCD,My family is driving me crazy and I just want to disappear. The only person who doesn't ask the whole world from me is my sister.,"I just had an awful weekend for my OCD. I had to visit my father who is a former drug addict and alcoholic and who cheated on my mom and left her with nothing  then got fired because of drug use and spent his 500.000 termination money in two or three months with women  parties and drugs. I had to take him in so he wouldn't be homeless and he made my life and my fiance's life hell. OCD got so bad I almost lost my job and thought of killing myself. Needless to say  he's a huge trigger  especially because his hygiene is still  disgusting even for non-ocd sufferers. (Once he vacuumed his own 💩 and swore it hadn't been him. I was cleaning my house to receive a student and was presented with this situation. Thanks dad.) 

Everytime I get through a harsh situation like that  I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks the whole week prior to it  my OCD gets worse and I just get real tired. My fiance does too  as he ends up with doing even more chores because I can't do anything and also because he gets anxious and tired from seeing me and my sister in such a bad situation. We thought we could get some rest this weekend  but my mom just told me that she's moving (out of nowhere) because the landlord sent them away or something and she wants me to take care of my sister for the weekend  so my sister will sleep at my apartment  in a mattress in the living room. My mom is great but she's never been a MOM  I've always been kind of responsible for my sister and even my parents because they're so irresponsible and immature. I'm tired of being the person everyone in the family runs to when they have a problem  not because they want advice  but because they want ME to solve the problem for them  to talk to people for them. I can't live my life without their interference.

My sister is 17 and because of her dysphoria  her depression and her anxiety  she's not yet going to college or getting a job and pandemic has made it worse. Besides  we're super close  although recently she's been isolating herself more. My mom always says I have to talk to her about all of it  that she only listens to me etc  but I'm not her mom. I can't educate her or anything  I can only be there for her as my sister. This makes me feel so guilty  like I'm a bad sister and daughter because I can't solve their problems or take their pain away  but it's also annoying as heck. I just wanted to have had a true childhood  a true adolescence  and I'm just beginning my life. At 18 I noticed my dad was getting worse and decided if I didn't get a job  when he lost his we would have nowhere to go. It was a heavy weight on my shoulders. I'm somewhat financially stable now at 24 and I've helped my mom financially as much as I could  but with the pandemic I'm starting to not have enough money even for myself. It's getting rough  especially with medication and therapy expenses that can amount to 1000 because of medical insurance and all of that. She more than once asked me to take my sister in so she could move to another city and start over because my sister doesn't want to move there  but I can't. Not while my parents are still alive  I need to set boundaries even if it breaks my heart. Besides I don't have the money and my mom wouldn't be able to help much with the expenses. My dad is also broke and my grandma has been giving him money  so he can't pay child support. Also  I can't bring my sister to live with my fiance and I because I can't impose this sort of responsibility on my future husband. It's not fair  especially after he took my father in.

Now  my sister is coming here this weekend. It's not that I don't want her here but for me anyone entering my house in the middle of a pandemic is one of the most terrible things for my OCD and I'll be so  so tired the next week. Also  damage control like cleaning the house and taking anxiety pills will go through the roof. My mom says it's because my sister will get lost in the middle of moving  as if she's a dog. I couldn't bring myself to say no because of my sister  but now I feel so bad anyways and very nervous about this challenging situation. I don't know if I made the right choice and I feel guilty for thinking that way.

OCD,Existential OCD - the worst of it all. I don't want to be here anymore.,"I posted this in a sub about panic attacks before  but I've found out that it's called existential OCD. Here's my situation:

I've been suffering from chronic derealization for several years now and it never really bothered or scared me until december 2022. Ever since that I have existential panic attacks  because I get too philosophical about why I feel this way. My brain forces me to think questions  that are impossible to answer. I'm at a point where I feel like I'm already dead or live in a AI type of world. Once I had this thought that the possibility of not existing MUST be way bigger than existing  because it makes no sense that the possibility is bigger  that the universe came out of nothing. Then I get too aware that I'm on a floating ball in the middle of nothing and wonder how no one is panicking because of it.

I'm so out of touch with my surroundings that I don't even feel like I'm doing the things thst I'm doing by myself. I forget what I saw when I walked 10 minutes outside or as it never happened. When I'm panicking I feel scared that my body could disappear into nothing. The sky seems so huge and I can't look at it anymore. I have a constant blurry vision and can't really focus. Like I shouldn't exist right now  because as I said  the possibility will always be higher that out of nothing  can't be nothing (big bang). 

It's so bad that I just wanna die. I'm too aware of my own brain and wonder how I'm able to have thoughts and that I'm an actual human being. I wonder why things look the way they look. I feel like I'm in the Truman Show. And I can't just ""accept the feeling"" to make me feel better and ignore it  when this is all I see everyday. 

It feels like I'm one step away from psychosis and that I'm actually the only person on this planet with conciousness. My psychiatrist didn't really listen to what I had to say  he was all about medication and left me alone with that. Tried a Benzo  killed my anxiety  but not the derealization  so it can't be anxiety related. On Seroquel now  but not any improvement. I can't do this anymore. Does anyone else feel this way or has found their way out of it?",160,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/13owt6v/existential_ocd_the_worst_of_it_all_i_dont_want/

Most of my intrusive thoughts are about my intelligence  and they basically say that ""if I don't do that  my intelligence and creativity will disappear; do this and do that to not have the same intelligence as that person.""

OCD,OCD Partner (is it the ocd or is it just him?),"UPDATE: i think he is more likely having OCPD and maybe OCD on top of it (i just got into the OCPD subreddit rabbit hole)
—————-

Hi 

I don’t have OCD but my partner does. I am also apologizing in advance bc I am still in the process of understanding this disorder  I might be wrong.

So  there’s a lot of issues with our differences.
He’s 43M  from the UK  has OCD;
Me 31F  southeast asian  neurotypical I assume  but he thinks I have ADHD. We live in the same country but different cities  so we’re long distance. 

We are only 3 months into the relationship  but I have cried so much and have felt hurt a lot.

He know he has OCD but refuses therapy. In the first month  he was super strict on me  I need to follow routines and his rules. So i called it out and we made an agreement to communicate better and be more chill.

These days he said I talk too much. He said I can’t comment on his recent garden project because it triggers him and lashed out on me. I apologized because I didn’t mean to upset him. Then when I share random stuff about my day  he always criticizes my actions  even to a single bit. I am struggling to change jobs right now  but everything I do feels wrong and every convo always ends up that I should be focusing my energy on improving myself. I am trying my best every time. But it has been affecting me negatively. It is draining me and I feel unworthy. Sometimes I really want to disappear. I don’t think I can handle ending things because I do love him. 
I don’t know if it’s his OCD that triggers him to treat me this way or just his character. I try to make him understand that we’re two different people and sometimes I can’t manage to live up to his expectations and standards. It feels like walking on eggshells right now.

I want to understand more about OCD so I can be a better partner for him in the future.  ",3,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1gilyyk/ocd_partner_is_it_the_ocd_or_is_it_just_him/
OCD,"Spending Valentine's Day alone after a breakup and I can't stop thinking about the poem ""OCD"" by Neil Hilborn","[Neil Hilborn - OCD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnKZ4pdSU-s)

The first time I saw her  everything in my head  
went quiet. All the tics  all the constantly  
refreshing images  just disappeared.  
  
When you have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder   
you don't really get quiet moments. Even in bed  
I'm thinking: did I lock the door yes did I wash my hands  
yes did I lock the door yes did I wash my hands yes.  
But when I saw her  the only thing I could think about  
was the hairpin curve of her lips or the eyelash  
on her cheek the eyelash on her cheek the eyelash on her  
cheek. I knew I had to talk to her.  
  
I asked her out six times. In thirty seconds.  
She said yes after the third one  but none of them  
felt right so I had to keep going. On our first date  
I spent more time organizing my meal by color  
than I did eating or talking to her  but she loved it.  
She loved that I had to kiss her goodbye sixteen times   
or twenty-four times if it was Wednesday. She loved  
that it took me forever to walk home because  
there are a lot of cracks in our sidewalk.  
  
When we moved in together  she said that she felt safe   
like no one would ever rob us because I definitely  
locked the door eighteen times. I'd always watch her mouth  
when she talked when she talked when she talked  
when she talked. When she said she loved me   
her mouth would curl up at the edges. At night   
she'd lay in bed and watch me turn all the lights off  
and on and off and on and off and on and off  
and on and off. She'd close her eyes and imagine  
that days and nights were passing in front of her.  
  
Some mornings  I'd start kissing her goodbye  
but she'd just leave because I was making her late  
for work. When I stopped at a crack in the sidewalk   
she just kept walking. When she said she loved me   
her mouth was a straight line. She told me  
I was taking up too much of her time.  
  
Last week she started sleeping at her mother's place.   
She told me that she shouldn't have let me get so attached   
that this whole thing was a mistake  but how  
can it be a mistake that I don't have to wash my hands  
after I touch her? Love is not a mistake. It's killing me  
that she can run away from this and I just can't. I can't  
go out and find someone new because I always think of her.  
  
Usually  when I obsess over things  I see germs  
sneaking into my skin. I see myself crushed  
by an endless succession of cars. She  
was the first beautiful thing I ever got stuck on.  
I want to wake up every morning thinking  
about the way she holds her steering wheel.  
How she turns shower knobs like she's opening a safe.  
How she blows out candles blows out candles blows out  
candles blows out candles blows out candles blows out candles  
blows out—now  I just think about who else is kissing her.  
I can't breathe because he only kisses her once.  
He doesn't care if it's perfect. I want her back so bad   
I leave the door unlocked. I leave the lights on.",3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1ipi0sr/spending_valentines_day_alone_after_a_breakup_and/

OCD,I'm slowly killing myself by drinking,"I just can't do ANYTHING else if I don't do my compulsions. In the back of my mind constantly. My brain is torturing me. When I think something is right  my mind says something that is wrong and I need to do it again. My strongest compulsion is to watch something again  whether its a video or a website  a word or something else (internet) and I set the ones that I love up for death within a timeframe I create in my head because things I do and don't  and I CONTROL all of that stuff.... its almost 3 pm now and I started drinking 5 am just to subdue the new feelings and I don't know what to do. 

I can't function like a normal person and I get very deep connections with my thoughts and compulsions. My biggest intrusive thoughts when it comes to videos and stuff is seeing a family member in a horrible scenario and then i need to go back in the video to fix it for them... I tried to conquer this by literally wishing death and horrible things upon my family members on specific points in videos and pictures just to show myself it doesnt matter if I do not go back to that point in the video to fix it  I can just say straight after or hours after that I didn't mean it.... if that makes sense  shortly I want to show myself that I don't need to go back and watch a SPECIFIC point or symbol to fix any horrible things.

OCD,What do you think?,"**\*\* If you are reading this as a compulsion or reassurance seeking  please do not read this post! Also  if you are in a state where you are easily triggered  please do not read as well! Some may become triggered  and others may not! I just wanted to make this post to help others not feel alone and to share my experience. \*\***

Hello friends!! It's been a hot minute since I posted on this subreddit! I will occasionally reread my older posts  and I can 100% say I was compulsing and seeking reassurance. I have been through therapy and put in the work to be where I am now! I am not healed completely by no means but feel ready enough to talk about a recent experience you may relate to at some point and to share some insight I have learned from my experience with ROCD. 

Recovery is a slow process and not a walk in the park. It's been hard and I know it will be harder at times! I have had setbacks and flare ups  which is a completely normal part of healing! So please do not feel guilty  discouraged or ashamed for having setbacks and/or flare ups  because it's all part of the process! Nobody's healing journey is smooth or ""perfect""! I have learned to use any situation as an opportunity for an ERP exercise  and it took me a WHILE to get to that point. I still have my moments  such as last week for example. 

  
OCD's root is fear. Whatever OCD is making you obsess about feels real to you and causes immense anxiety. OCD makes you feel isolated  and you feel you're the only exception. Your OCD is different  and you'll never feel positive emotions again. After attending group sessions  I learned that OCD is  in fact  a liar! I am not alone  and neither are you! You are not the exception and you learning to live with OCD. That was a tough one for me to accept was the fact that OCD will never go away but I must learn to live with it. I'm still learning to navigate life with uncertainty and find myself again. I feel OCD has stripped so much joy from me  I lost myself. I lost myself trying to be certain about my relationship and other reoccurring themes. After the start of 2025 and getting engaged  I knew I had to take charge  or I was forever going to let OCD rob the joys of life from me. I can't remember where I saw this but this rings true: OCD is just three letters in the alphabet  not your whole identity. 

  
I know it's easier said than done  but please know you're not alone. My fiancé told me this and I wanted to share it with you. It's helped keep me grounded and bring me back to reality. He told me ""Don't be OCD  be you. Be Emily!"" (which is my name  hi nice to meet you!)



I am going to talk about this situation that happened last week to offer insight. I found a content creator that struggled with ROCD back when I struggled the hardest. They posted ROCD content I related to the most and had the exact same thoughts and experiences. I looked up to them when I felt alone with OCD  which may or may not be a compulsion  but I am okay with uncertainty! Anyway  I recently stumbled across their page again on social media and wanted to see what they were up to! They started posting about how they turned their life to Christ and gave it to God. They gave ROCD to God and how their intrusive thoughts went away overnight. 

 It upset me for a number of reasons: 

1. It's damaging to the people who struggle with ROCD and religion/spirituality.

2. It can send the wrong message to those who struggle  and it just goes away overnight which is false and requires hard work.

3. I experienced it firsthand to know this does not work for everyone.

  
I used spiritualty as a form of reassurance seeking and a form of compulsion. I also turned to Christ in hopes he would make OCD disappear overnight. It in fact  did not go away and I went back to square one. The Bible was extremely triggering for me and sent me the wrong messages. It evoked more fear and caused me to develop scrupulosity OCD. I went to church every Sunday  got baptized  and started reading the Bible from front to back in hopes I was deemed worthy enough for God to take away OCD. The longer this went on for  and the worse OCD got  I truly started to believe ROCD was God's way of telling me I wasn't supposed to be with my fiancé. I believed scrupulosity OCD was God's way for punishing me for spending my entire life being a sceptic. It was a cluster of intrusive thoughts and anxiety. I worked past it through hard work and therapy so I can say I feel healed from scrupulosity OCD. I found a spirituality that aligns with me and makes my soul feel fulfilled. 

I had to stop myself from commenting on their post. I knew commenting would upset me even more and not make the situation any better. I remembered healing is different for everyone  so everyone's journey is never the same. I felt commenting would feed OCD. But the comment section was people expressing their disappointment but their happiness they found something to help heal them. And I agree! If they found something that works for them and heals them  great! That is so amazing  and I am so proud!! 

But please do not claim your OCD went away overnight to your audience that may or may not deal with OCD on a daily basis and looks up to you for support when they feel isolated. It's damaging and your audience may follow your lead. ""If it worked for them  it may work for me!"" If religion doesn't work for some  they may be sent into a spiral  which is truly damaging to someone with obsessive compulsion behavior. 

Please do not use religion and spirituality as a cure for mental health issues or a form of compulsive behavior and reassurance seeking. It's not a long-term solution and doesn't deal with the root of the problem. OCD doesn't go away overnight so please don't feel awful because you changed your life or spirituality  and OCD didn't spontaneously go away in a matter of hours. If anyone claims that  scroll away. **You are not alone. Seek therapy  join the support groups  and do what makes you happy!!** **Despite OCD  love yourself  show yourself compassion and grace. Breathe and know it will all be alright.**

OCD,Accidentally glanced at the sun. OCD is telling me I'll be blind by tomorrow.,"Woke up this morning and saw a TikTok about a woman who looked at the last solar eclipse for about 10 seconds and got partial blindness.

My kids and I had eclipse glasses and went out to check out the partial solar eclipse. Everything was going good and we were being so careful. But after I checked out the eclipse  I turned to remove my glasses but didn't realize the sun's reflecting was shining on the window of the car behind us and flashed in my eye.

I flinched away instantly  but now my left eye is watery and hurting a bit. I remember glances at the sun in the past  but don't recall these symptoms.

I hope it's all in my head  but OCD is in my ear telling me that I'll wake up tomorrow with a blind spot. 🤦🏽‍♀️

OCD,Ocd everything hurts,Visual ocd I can't seem to do ERP and I keep getting affected like I do ERP but it's still there. It's about getting slapped,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/15z3o9u/ocd_everything_hurts/
OCD,I've been a physician for nearly a decade  and was just now diagnosed with OCD.,"I wish I could say it was a bit of a shock  but I had always worried I could have some ""OCD features"". I have had depression and anxiety since starting medical school  and have responded well to sertraline and therapy. However  amongst all of this  I have always obsessed that I would truly ""do no harm"". Now  nearly 10 years into being a physician  has manifested in obsessions about how my patients are doing. I am a primary care doctor  and can't stop myself from reading everything I can about my patients  their history  and their condition. When I am not at work  I am constantly worried I have fucked something up and someone will get hurt. When I am at work  I am double/triple checking my actions. I have to have a perfect message basket at all times and I can't sleep until it's clean.

Weirdly  the thing I obsess the most about is that my patients have a good visit. I want them to be heard and felt like it was the best visit they ever had with a doctor. So many stores of patients being brushed to the side  forgotten  and ignored; my mission is to make sure all my patients feel validated. The double edged sword of this  is that if I suspect the patient didn't feel this way  or if I read in a note a negative comment about me  my compulsions take hold. I do everything to make it up to them. Above and beyond  give out my cell phone  sell my soul to them to make up for it. This compulsion makes me feel better  but then having done this  it sucks the life out of me. It's not sustainable.

In some ways  I feel relived to name this. I feel guilty and embarrassed I wouldn't admit this to myself before. As a doctor I should know better. I am starting a treatment program soon  and I hope to reduce these thoughts. I truly love being a doctor  and I don't want to give it up because of my OCD.

OCD,Can’t find any info about my OCD main theme. Is it really that rare?,"About 80% of my intrusive thoughts (I’m 28F  if that matters)  circulate around this theme. However  I’ve never been able to find it covered in an article about OCD or even in this subreddit (even though I joined recently).

I have intrusive thoughts about people secretly hating me and wanting/plotting to harm me (or my close ones) in some way. I’ve researched this topic a lot  but all I find is about “harm OCD”  which circulates around you having intrusive thoughts to harm someone. Mine is reversed. I don’t have thoughts about hurting myself or others  but them hurting me.

Some examples:

- Whenever I have even a small inconvenience/disagreement with someone  I get intrusive thoughts that they now hate me and want to hurt me. Usually if it’s a stranger I think they’ll physically attack me  and if it’s someone I know - they’re plotting a way to make me look bad/turn everyone against me/cause bad things into my life. I get the same thoughts if someone close to me gets into an argument with another person and start obsessively worrying about them.

- I’m hyper aware of my surroundings when I’m outside. When I see someone visibly drunk (or looking inadequate for any reason) I get intrusive thoughts that they want to harm me  which makes me feel unsafe.

- I’m pretty private with everything  mainly out of fear that it can make someone jealous.

- When something unfortunate happens to me or a close one  my intrusive thoughts contribute it to either my negative thinking  or someone “wishing me bad”.

Does someone else experience this as well?",51,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1js8lh6/cant_find_any_info_about_my_ocd_main_theme_is_it/
OCD,The misinformation on this sub is rampant and we should hold people accountable for it.,"I'm honestly extremely disappointed and tired of the rampant misinformation that goes on on this sub. Every day I see at least one post that spreads fear mongering information  straight up fake news or says that this THING will be the solution to everything.

Key point: **the golden standard EVIDENCE BASED method of recovering from OCD is ERP treatment and also some techniques (not all) of CBT. Also  medication. If there are comorbidities  the spectrum of possible treatments widens. For example  someone with OCD and PTSD may benefit from EMDR therapy even though it's not the golden standard for OCD. (Edit) there are other evidence based treatments for OCD that are surfacing or that have already been shown as effective. These include ACT  DBT (especially when in comorbidity with suicidaility or personality disorders)  TMS  neurofeedback and others.**

I'm not saying this to invalidate your experience with alternative methods. I'm not saying your experience isn't valid. What enrages me is when people make their experience a gospel truth  using gatekeeping phrases like **""if you don't do this you'll NEVER recover!""  ""This thing cures OCD I'm living proof of it""  ""This is THE SOLUTION to OCD"".**

There is an ocean of a difference between that and saying ""I tried this thing and it worked wonders for me  maybe it's worth a shot"". OCD is not this lighthearted topic where you can state your opinion as facts. It's one thing to do it with toppings of a pizza  it's another thing to do it with a disorder.

In my recovery journey  I found that practicing yoga  and even studying yoga philosophy helped me a lot  and I'm really into it  even the most esoteric aspects. Now  do I think yoga is the cure for OCD? No. Just because it worked for me  does that give me permission to share it as this magic potion that will heal everyone? **NO**. Can I still talk about it on here? **YES**!

Here are the most popular misinformed titles  slogans  and posts that I've seen:

1. Turn to god.
2. You need to follow this philosopher / teacher / guru's saying.
3. ERP is a scam. Rationalizing fears helps! It helped me! Cue insane theory about OCD being a good thing that makes you a superior human being to others
4. Build ""discipline"" and ""self control"" (ffs).
5. Stop masturbating  go nofap  you'll detox yourself from the bad thoughts bro trust me.
6. Don't use SSRI or ""mainstream medication""  use psychedelics because they'll free your mind (EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TAKE)
7. Yoga and eastern meditation and opening of the chakras will cleanse your spirit. OCD is a sign of chakra blockage.

I know that this is a problem that's rampant in most mental health communities  but it particularly makes me mad that it happens on this sub because **we should be well aware how much black and white thinking hurts**  yet you'll still see posts like ""if you don't do this you're not recovered""  ""you NEED to do this  it's the cure"". People with OCD already feel lost with the information they have on the disorder  why overshadow the good  legitimate information we have with your miracle cure / theory? Why lead people astray?

Again  I'm not invalidating your experience if you're part of one of the seven points (I am too). I'm condemning people who use this talking points to share misinformation and lead people to believe that that's what 100% will ""cure"" them  that that's the key they've been looking for. You can still suggest it (apart from the really dangerous advice) or talk about your experience  you're 10000% free to do so and maybe I also will in the future.

Let's make this a place a source of critical thinking  respectful sharing  not a competition of who has the true ""magic potion"". If you think there's a legitimate effective way that should be known and popularized  look up good resources on it on the internet and share them here  let's build common knowledge on this disorder based on evidence. If we use this tool of sharing for good  we'll make a great impact on this community. But if you abuse it and treat ocd recovery as this shallow  one-way matter **you'll do nothing but harm**.


EDIT: some much needed clarification. I profusely apologize for not mentioning the other evidence based modalities of therapy that exist for OCD. I sincerely forgot  I’m aware of them   I was too lost in thought and I mispoke. I wanted to say that ERP was the golden standard and instead I said it was the only option  which is just outright false. I’m very sorry",316,111,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/wjdx41/the_misinformation_on_this_sub_is_rampant_and_we/
OCD,I’m exhausted and scared,"I’m so tired of dealing with mental illness. It feels like a loosing battle. I get a win  but then I keep getting set back. 

I have been on 100 mg of fluvoxamine for a couple months now. I wasn’t sure how well it was working  I didn’t want to say it wasn’t but I also didn’t want to say it was. My psychiatrist decided to put me on 0.5 mg of risperidone to pair with the fluvoxamine. This was about a month ago. 

Everything was going really well for about a week  maybe two (i’ve now noticed i was starting to decline on week two  but very subtly). My OCD was so manageable that first week. I felt so free! And then the side effects started showing up… I couldn’t wake up or remember to do the things I needed to do. I was missing meetings  leaving things on in the lab that I shouldn’t be  remembering doing things that I never actually did  and ultimately cutting myself on accident with wire cutters leading to two stitches. I was a zombie. The dissociation was intense and any moment I wasn’t forcing myself to stay awake I would drift off into deep slumber. 

Once this lead to hurting myself (on accident) I decided I needed to get off this medication. Which fucking sucks because it’s still helping with my OCD. I’ve been tapering off of it and last night was my first night not taking it. I woke up at 4 am riddled with anxiety  after having a panic attack before falling asleep. I’m so scared of my OCD coming back to how it was. It was torture to live like that and now I know how it feels to be free  I can’t go back. 

I’m currently on a week and a half medical leave from graduate school. I go back on Monday. I’m dreading my return. My advisor (who I very closely work with every week) is a nightmare. He has such expectations that I never get a break. This is the first time I’ve had time off in my two years at this program. I’ve worked christmas eve  new year’s eve  new year’s day  so many more holidays  saturday’s and sunday’s because that’s the expectations he sets. I’m exhausted from this. And i’m so scared all this work i’ve done will go down the drain because i’m too mentally ill to finish writing my thesis. 

I’m terrified of not finishing my degree and letting down everyone around me. My girlfriend  who moved cross country with me to get this degree. My parents who continue to support me in any way they can  funding my move  paying my rent in undergrad  being my safety net  and most importantly: always believing in me. i’m scared that when I go back  the expectation will be that i am well and will have no further issues  but i don’t see how that’s possible. it doesn’t help that my advisor doesn’t really believe in mental illness or rest. 

i’m so close to finishing but it feels so far. i don’t know if i can do this. i need help  but i don’t know what will actually help me. therapy is fine but it’s not really a true fix for it all. i feel so hopeless with the state of the world and the reality i live in. i don’t know how to be happy with the bleak future ahead. i need help. i don’t know what to do.

OCD,My gf has OCD and was bad mouthing me to her friend behind my back,"Hi all 

Me and my gf have been together for almost 3 months. She struggles with OCD and I recently found out that she was bad mouthing about me really bad and very personally to her best friend. 

I understand it’s normal to vent to friends about general frustrations  but she went over the top and disclosed private health info I shared with my gf to her friend  blamed a yeast infection on me and called me dirty (it was because of birth control)  compared me to her ex  found my ex on fb  just a lot of hateful stuff about me; while also giving me an impression that she never felt that way prior to me finding out.

Earlier on I was literally begging for vulnerability because I know what comes with dishonest emotions  resentment and I didn’t want that. I was incredibly hurt by this realization.

She was fearful and insecure of losing me and projected it in a way that was incredibly disrespectful. The friend doesn’t even have a grip on her own scenario and I guess is in an abusive relationship and laughs it off like it’s funny  constantly disclosing info about her partner too. 

I considered breaking up with her  but seeing her awareness of it made me give her another chance. She’s getting therapy and really wants to work on being vulnerable with a healthy professional. She’s even offered for me to come sometimes and has been very remorseful.

I’m curious if this is something anyone has struggled with on the other end. Is it a normal occurrence to confide in a friend in a hateful way but present as if everything’s perfect in the relationship? Am I wasting my time trying to understand her?",31,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1est6mm/my_gf_has_ocd_and_was_bad_mouthing_me_to_her/
OCD,Help with writing a believable character with OCD,"Hello friends. Bear with me cause this is a long one

I am currently writing a book where my main character has OCD. Her ""thing"" is doing everything in fours  like opening the door or washing her hands  but I'm struggling with trying to make her OCD a big part of her life without constantly mentioning how she does everything 4 times. The last thing I want is to ridicule people with OCD by making it too over the top. Obviously  I can google this but I'd love some experiences from real people. I would love if some of you could give me some subtle ways your OCD affects your life or answer some of these questions if you have the time: When is your OCD the worst? Is it obvious to the people around you? How much of your life does it consume? How much time do you ""waste""  every day because of it? If you have depression  anxiety  or PTSD how does it affect those?

Here's a scene I wrote that I feel falls a bit flat  any suggestions are welcome.:

  Scarlett pulled her car up to the front gates of the estate and stopped before the security system to the left. She rolled down her window and rang the bell four times  cursing herself in the process.

“Who’s speaking?” Luca said through the intercom.

“Me  dumbass. Just look through the cameras.”

“No  I like it old school.”

The gates opened  sliding each door to its respective side in a loud squeaking noise. They really had to oil the wheels on that thing soon or she’d die of a headache. She greeted the gatekeeper Henry with a subtle nod before parking her Camaro in its designated space amongst the other vehicles in the parking area and counted how often she clicked the lock button on her car keys.

She dragged herself to the house and rubbed the bottom of her shoes against the doormat before entering and hanging her trench coat on the hangers in the hallway  but she didn’t like the way it hung the first time  so she took it off and tried again  only this time it folded strangely  and before she knew it she had taken it off the hanger four times and decided it hung well enough at the fourth try.

Thank you in advance :)

Edit: Another question  do you have multiple kinds of OCD  or is it just limited to one kind?

  
Edit 2: I want to answer some questions because its getting a bit much trying to reply to everyone individually lmao.

Firstly  the last thing i want to do is ridicule anyone. I apologize deeply if i have offended anyone. My only intention is to represent OCD as accurately as possible without having experienced it myself.

Secondly  i should have specified the kind of story i am writing and why. here's the blurb:

Noah  Scarlett  and Toby have been inseparable since childhood—three friends bound by loyalty  love  and the shared experiences of growing up together. But as they navigate the turbulent years of adolescence  their bond begins to crumble. What once felt indestructible turns dark  twisted by betrayal and pain.  
When Toby’s actions break the trust so carefully constructed between them  Scarlett and Noah make an irreversible choice: they take his life  seeking revenge for the hurt he inflicted on them. But as reality sets in  they are left to face the brutal aftermath of their decision.  
With their hands stained by violence  Scarlett and Noah find themselves slipping into a dark place. Guilt gnaws at the edges of their sanity  and the lines between justice and vengeance blur beyond recognition.  
The story delves into the devastating consequences of seeking justice by your own hand—and what it means to live with the choices you cannot take back.

  
They basically go cray cray bc they killed a dude. Scarlett's OCD is a big factor in this because it's always been a consuming part of her life  which only gets worse after they kill Toby. It's a character-driven story  basically meaning no plot  just vibes. The reason i am giving her OCD is because i myself have struggled with dermatillomania (which is a form of OCD) all my life and ya know. People put fragments of themselves in the stories they want to tell. But its very different from what Scarlett has since i just pick and chew on my fingers subconsciously. It does not consume my mind  which is what happens to Scarlett  hence why i am asking for help.

  
Thank you all for sharing a piece of yourselves. It is greatly appreciated. I will make some significant changes to Scarlett's character and hopefully post again here soon for further assistance :)",8,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1g2hk10/help_with_writing_a_believable_character_with_ocd/
OCD,When reading in my second language I often feel the need to reread over and over again until I got it. Soon I feel like giving up and stop reading.

This never happened to me until this year and I have been studying for several years. If I am thinking about something in my head while reading  feel itchy  or feel tense I feel the need to go back to reread the sentence until I don’t feel any of those things. Eventually I either reread the sentence again  keep scratching myself  or feel the need to just stop entirely. Does anyone else have this issue? I don’t have it at all in my first language  English.

I won’t take any meds my psychiatrist prescribes without doing the test because thanks to my body image issues I am scared of the side effects  especially weight gain. On top of all that I can’t even leave the house because my OCD is so debilitating at this point and my therapist who I spoke to yesterday during a virtual appointment didn’t offer any help.

OCD,My heart breaks for everyone who suffers from OCD. This is a rest stop  take a hug.,"Hey  take a seat  take some hot coffee or tea or whatever you like  and just give yourself a breather for once. Even if it‘s just for the time being of reading this post. 

My heart breaks for each and every single one of you. Myself included. It‘s not your fault  you‘re not a bad person. You don‘t need to carry this guilt. You have nothing to be afraid of  i promise. You are capable  and i‘m so proud of you for not giving up. 

It‘s easy to forget what this disorder is actually doing to us  because we are so focused on our worries  fears  and the consequences that OCD tells us comes with not worrying about it. OCD is so vile and wretched  it tricks us into spending all this time and energy on preventing our worst fears. It tricks us into thinking we are evil and heartless if we dont  that it‘s our fault and therefore we must sacrifice our entire life bending to it‘s rules. That is the exact goal of this disorder  it makes it possible so we don‘t realize what kind of actual torture we are putting ourselves through. If we never come to see the gravity of that  we will keep obeying  keep allowing OCD‘s grasp of control. That way we will never break free. 

Meanwhile what is ACTUALLY happening  is that you  my dear fellow soul  are destroying yourself. You are robbing yourself of your own life slowly. You are abandoning yourself a little bit every time you trust OCD‘s words more  than your own.

I know it‘s hard to not fall into believing OCD‘s lies  and I know it feels so real. I know you‘re afraid. I am too. But if i can give you one thing on your journey.. remember all of this is the only thing that allows OCD to keep you in the cycle. View OCD as a toxic partner if it helps you. OCD is manipulating you constantly so you keep being too afraid to set boundaries and cut the toxicity out of your life. to keep you controlled. 

Your wellbeing  YOU as a person  YOUR life  is more important than whatever OCD is telling you. Allow yourself to let go. You don‘t need to solve your obession. You don‘t need to figure it out.

OCD,I'm afraid i would have to give up my halfway through education thanks to ocd,"Im 20F  currently studying in a university abroad (5 hours of flight away). I have went through 2 years and i have another 2 years left in my education. However  i started developing awful contamination OCD since my fourth semester and now i'm in my fifth.

It's getting so debilitating  and even worse i live alone here so i'm always a mess. I almost cant take it anymore. Honestly  i am afraid i would break if i continue this.

Lately  i have been having thoughts to drop out and move back home with my parents. I havent talked to them about it or about my ocd at all  but i plan to do so soon.

I honestly think i am really not fit to be living abroad with my condition. But it also feels like a huge waste if i drop out now. My parents already spent tons of money on my education and life here. I am also not getting my time back. That was two years of my youth life. 

I dont know if it's worth it to drop out or not. If any of you have some advice or any experience similar to this you can share  i would appreciate a lot. ",2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1ffmsnr/im_afraid_i_would_have_to_give_up_my_halfway/
OCD,I think I'm about to be broken up with again.,"I've seen this pattern before. I literally have nobody else to talk to at all  but I need a therapist so badly about this. This is the best I can do.

Recently we called in the night and she was just playing games to pass the time with. It was a little odd  since she never plays any games. She usually is more attentive  but now she's monotone and preoccupied with that and social media.

I've asked if things were good or if she had any concerns regarding this relationship (were a month in after months of the talking stage). Because I have to come to my hometown for winter break  it makes this relationship long distance for a little bit. She told me she has to think further about if she wants this or not. I also told my concerns whether she's fine dealing with this mental illness (though I never blame or use my illness to excuse myself  but rather narrate my perspective in things). Then that's when I feel like I fucked up myself.

While we were in the talking stage months before  she said that she's kinda obsessed with me. So during that call  I said I'm obsessed with her and wanted to make sure that I like her for her  not the idea of her  to which she replies with an ""oh"" that sounded a bit scornful than anything. She never looked up  but its almost like she's barely listening in  barely enough to hear keywords in order to continue a conversation. We usually tell each other our innermost feelings  but after that call. She hasn't video called in a few days. From my horrible love life  I see the patterns that I'm about to be broken up with  which really saddens me... especially because she's the best relationship I had compared to all others.

I swear I don't think I've done anything bad  but try my best to be a good bf. But I can't help but notice that she might be losing feelings  maybe bc I'm far away during breaks  or bc of just me and my personality. Can somebody pls help calm me down? Idek if this is real or this could be my distorted perceptions again. Should I be worried? I really am lost about how to feel abt that whole interaction...",3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1ht8h94/i_think_im_about_to_be_broken_up_with_again/
OCD,Scared I'm broken,"Relatively new to having an OCD diagnosis and not currently working with a therapist who's well versed in it. But I need to know if this resonates with anyone else. Please answer if you've got any insight  I feel so alone. I know this is kinda long  I'm sorry.

I have Pure O-OCD and it recently transitioned from physical health anxiety to mental health anxiety. I'm on Mirtazepine and Quetiapine. I'm also 92 days sober from all self medicating substances which kept this disorder at bay.

The meds have made my physical panic a lot better  but I find myself obsessed with how I think or feel. It's all hours of the day. I'll have 5 minutes of feeling normal in the morning before I start questioning that normalcy and ifs just a miserable spiral until I go to bed. I've been out of work for close to a year now working on my mental health  but since I quit drinking  I've been on and off spiraling mentally. I'm constantly convinced something in fundamentally wrong with my head or my thoughts  I'm constantly feeling so brain foggy but overwhelmed by everything. I still get small panic attacks just without the physical symptoms  where my brain feels bad and wrong with no physical attachment when I'm overwhelmed. It's all I can really think about. I'm constantly convinced I'm about to spiral and go crazy and get worse despite having some days where I function better and some worse. I feel some degree of fear and worry all the time. It's almost impossible to actually focus on anything else and I'm doing the bare minimum to take care of myself. I'm scared of big emotions or ""losing control"" since I had a hysterical episode and almost got involuntarily psych warded last year (it was due to severe pain caused by a bursting cyst but it still scared me). 

I never used to be like this prior to getting covid in 2022  and I'm scared it'll never end. I feel so mentally *wrong*  like there's something wrong with my brain. I've had an MRI done as well as countless blood panels and other tests so there's no physical damage  but I'm so tunnel visioned and uncomfortable in my own head. I had to spend a day alone yesterday and the ruminating was so overwhelming I already set myself up today for failure. My psych says I need to learn to sit with the discomfort and my thoughts can't hurt me but it feels like I have some sort of brain injury I feel so far from the me that I used to be when I was drinking. 

I didn't mean to get so rambly but it feels like a prison of self doubt and like I'm going insane. There's little to no release. I keep being told time will heal but I've never gotten to talk to anyone else with this disorder and I feel so scared and alone. Anyone who's been here before and is willing to talk to me about it a little would mean more than I can put into words.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1e7vzb2/scared_im_broken/
OCD,Married to someone with OCD,"Hi  I am currently married to someone with OCD. Since we started dating  I have known that she is particular. Meals need to be cooked in a very specific way. Certain towels are strictly for certain things. Produce must be washed in a very specific way. Very nit-picky on driving and very sensitive to anything that is in the mold of how she drives. I constantly feel like I'm being tested by her. 

  
I was a mess when we started dating. Broken in so many ways  coming out of a previous marriage. She helped fix me in many ways  helped reshape my finances  helped me create a budgeting system  helped me find community  helped me feel more like myself by encouraging me to reengage with my passions. But it feels like now she is using all of this against me. 

  
For the longest time  she's told me that she wants to date a ""high-bar  high-caliber person."" She hoped / expects / and has asked me if I'm that person. In many ways  I was not when I met her. And I have listened to her and turned many things around. But it's been with major growing pains and I've gone kicking and screaming with some of these changes. I'm not perfect and change has been hard. 

So  I've exhausted her patience. We are at a point now where we almost fight daily. The smallest things set her off. Today  I put a load of laundry in the washer before showering and it set her off. Previously  she told me she doesn't like the washer running when she showers. I forgot this today when I went to shower  as she was going to shower after me. So she \*lit me up\* and when I said ""sorry for forgetting that"" she asked me ""when are you gonna have to stop apologizing for things?"" Told me she believes I must ""hate her"" for choosing to let her down daily (for things link forgetting not to put in a load of laundry). 

  
Time and time again she's told me I'm low-bar  incompetent  lazy  and stupid (actual words). I don't know what to do. I'm so exhausted from fighting. I'm so hurt. She destroys my self-confidence. She will not let me say ""I'm better"" because despite the fact that I have taken her advice and changed in so many ways  the fact that I do things like turn on the washing machine when I shower are hurting her. 

I believe she is rebranding her OCD as ""high bar"" and positioning herself above me to give herself moral high ground. Therefore  when I do something that is not in-line with her OCD  she calls me ""low bar"" and passes judgment  name-calls  and makes me feel horrible. 

  
What do I do? Thoughts? Is there any way to fix this? I am starting to feel that I'll never meet all her expectations. ",146,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1jd0sad/married_to_someone_with_ocd/

OCD,This is too much. If you have any advice  I would appreciate it. I'm really broken and devastated now.,The pain is too much. After all the heartache her unpredictability has caused me she's just expressed how apathetic she is. And the reason is because she's found somebody else. But she has been in the core of my heart for 5 years together or apart. Words cannot describe the pain I am feeling. She wasn't a girlfriend to me. She was much more than that. But she's found somebody else  because my life is too much a crap hole with all my problems  which are all rooted in the traumatic forced separation we had many years ago. But I am not ready for this. I'm already struggling with mental illness  broken relationship at home  failed college  lost the jobs I had  and an overall broken spirit of a man that usually keeps his head up. Of somebody that would never give up on her. And I never truly did. No matter what  so long as she loves me I would never give up on her. The amount of reasons not to be with her are of a scale most people on here would have left a long time ago. But I still remained in her life. She didn't see a future with me because of my problems  because of the fact that I am lost. Because of my anxiety issues. Because of my ocd. But still  I love her to death. I love her unconditionally. Even when she hurts me deeply  I can't help but forgive her. I'd be willing to forgive her for anything. All I wanted was to meet in person and connect like we did when we got back together  but she was always busy. Now she's found somebody else. It's too unbearable. I don't know how to handle this. I know you'll say you need to move on  but this couldn't happen at a worse time. I have no friends that I can vent to about this. The only person I can talk to about this is to myself  and even coming on here is a risk given the trolls that like to leave unjustified  callous remarks. It isn't just this. This is the luggage case that broken the camels back  that rests atop a whole bunch of other cases. It is too much for me to handle  and the problems will just continue. I can't take this. I don't want to eat. I just want to disappear. I just want to sleep and wake up and realize this was a beautiful dream that ended in a nightmare. It is more complicated than this. But this is what ocd and unresolved problems have done to my life. This is what trauma has done to my life. Life changing event  after life changing event goes by  but I sit on the sideline. I reach for it but I can never grasp it. I'm always held back. i live my life for an idealization of something that always ends failing. It always ends in failure. She was probably the only thing I was looking forward to. Talking to her. And now our conversation will be a goodbye. I can have it  but ocd won't let me be receptive of it. And the same shit in my life will continue  whilst I struggle to process and reflect over this as ocd stries to stop me  always being triggered by other people I love  my family  and for reasons that can all be traced back to that trauma. I am not ready for this. I cannot quantify the suffering she is bringing me  and if I could disappear or just go to sleep for the next month I would. I wish she understood  but she doesn't. And something I've noticed  is whenever one relationship ends  there's always another one lined up. I even saw the fucking profile of the guy she's now with. The thought of her being with somebody and never thinking about me again  while I remember the beautiful times we spent that changed my life  the year and four months I shared my heart with her  that lit a fire in my heart that continued separated or not. That somebody I loved with the utmost fervent passion would just block me  and then after all the agony and restlessness her random blocking  which happened after telling me she wanted to meet which made me feel a fuck of a lot better  she just wants to end it. And whilst the experience comes  but my ability to process it will be hindered by interactions that trigger me with people I love that I have unresolved issues with. And I can;t even begin to imagine how this will influence my hindsight. I have no jobs  no structure. I can't create structure for myself with this condition. before this I was living my life in hell. But now  it has taken on a whole new level. I don't even know if I can make the call. It's just too much to bear. The pain. Her apathy  her wanting to part ways. Her tendency to just give up  and on somebody that has never truly given up on her. She once cheated on me  very early in our relaitonship  and on the same day I had a conversation with her  I forgave her. I forgave her for different parts of her past. I supported her emotionally. I have a fuck of a lot of reasons to not be with her  one big one being a lot of suspicion about her family given what she has shared with me about them. I have a fuck of a lot of reasons  probably more than her  yet I don't give up. She. she just has another one lined up. I'm angry  sad  broken  empty  etc. All at the same time. Words can't describe the kind of agony I'm feeling.,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/bdtxjx/this_is_too_much_if_you_have_any_advice_i_would/
OCD,I feel like I'm broken beyond repair,"As my username says  I am a gay guy with pedophile OCD that got pretty severe over the last few months so I finally decided to go into therapy. My therapy won't start until August  but I already am on maximum dose Zoloft (started taking it again in April).

Anyway  the other day I went to a gay party for the first time in over a year. I felt anxious the whole day  thinking about what would happen if I go there and I don't find the guys attractive or I only find boy-ish guys attractive etc. etc. You probably know the drift. But when I finally got there  I actually had fun. The doubt was still there  but I liked flirting with guys  dancing with them and generally just having fun. I also managed to restrict my drinking - I am by no means an alcoholic  I maybe drink four or five times a year  but when I drink  I unfortunately tend to do it excessively.

There was one guy I really liked  I'd even say he could be the man of my dreams  as schmaltzy as that sounds (I like to think of myself as a romantic  even though my OCD makes that really hard). We danced a lot  talked a lot and learned how much we have in common and I really felt good around him. I was free and happy for the first time since I don't know when.

Then we started to make out  and at that moment  panic struck. I read somewhere that people like kissing people of the gender they are attracted to  but even feel disgusted by kissing people of the other gender. I know it's bullshit  since I kissed women before and wasn't disgusted and I know straight guys who kissed men that very evening and weren't disgusted  but at the moment our tongues intervened I really felt as though I was disgusted. After that  the evening turned into a nightmare. I still put on a mask of happiness  but inside I just felt like shit. I couldn't think straight  I didn't enjoy kissing or snuggling with the guy who could be the man of my dreams  I just wanted to go home  which in turns flared up my anxiety even more - because if I didn't like or didn't want to make out with a guy  that surely means I am a pedophile  right? Somehow  I managed to stay there until 6 a.m. but I felt to weak to even go to the bus stop  so I took a taxi and went right to bed.

The next day was even more horrible. In my mind I had two scenarios fighting with each other: Either I didn't like kissing him because I am a pedophile - then my life is ruined. Or I didn't like it because of my anxiety - then my life is still ruined because what should I do if my sexual attraction is coupled with anxiety? And from that on the thoughts went on to - the thoughts of pedophilia are also coupled with anxiety  so if your real sexual orientation can be coupled with anxiety  that could mean it's not POCD at all! And so on  and so on. I just feel crippled by my brain that just can't stop putting out these horrible scenarios.

And I know these horrible scenarios aren't even that horrible. Intellectually  I know that being a pedophile isn't a death sentence  I know there are therapies  and even though I would never be able to have a fulfilled sexual live (because of course I would never hurt a child) that seems to be a fair trade for not having this horrible anxiety anymore. There have been even times where I prayed that I just could accept I was a pedophile and move on with my life. Which of course didn't happen and just made my OCD worse - because if I wanted to be a pedophile  how could it be OCD? Ignoring the fact that I didn't want to be a pedophile  I just wanted to be free of anxiety even if it meant accepting my pedophilia.

But the thing that bothers me the most  apart from my OCD  and really just makes me want to stay in bed all day and cry is this simple fact: I maybe met the man of my dreams  but instead of being happy and calling him and going out with him I only feel anxiety.

I really hope that therapy is going to help me  and I know it probably will  but days like these really make me feel hopeless. After all  I already am on the maximum dose of Zoloft and I still feel like shit.

OCD,OCD is a trust issue,"Hi  fellow warriors.

The title is nothing new  of course.

But let me tell you why I think it is really a trust issue  based on what happened to me.

I never had issues with wild thoughts regarding usual ocd themes. Thoughts only bothered me when it was usually about something ""important"" like health  jobs  etc  like most people.

Then suddenly  one day  I started having trouble about a health issue that was not that big of a deal  but somehow I came to a conclusion that would be chronic  that gave me depression and anxiety.

After a week  I started treating anxiety. Then  suddenly  I got better for a day  like instant cure  I was not caring about that physical issue anymore.

But then  I woke with mild anxiety and got spooky  then I associated that with a real problem with my mind.

Everytime I thought about anxiety  I felt anxiety  simmilar to a panic syndrome. Then I always was checking if the anxiety thought was there. I was in a horrible state.

Anyway  after that  I started doubting myself and my mind.

I stopped trusting my mind  I stopped trusting how I always lived my life in a thought related context.

I started a compulsion to research youtube videos  articles  etc.

I started medication.

After 10 days of the first episode of anxiety thought  I started having intrusive thoughts after reading about ocd.

After that  it was spiral down. The ""no cure"" answers  the pessimist approach of many people. Therapists that I went to consult didnt quite understand the condition  and so on.

Now I am 2 months with ocd (at least thought based)  a little less actually.

I already consumed a lot of content  a lot of certainty research aka compulsion  and so on.

But to summarize this with the title  here is the thing. I dont know your ocd episodes and how they started  maybe many people dont even remember it. 

But today I saw clearly that the real issue for me was losing the trust in myself: trusting more what other people have to say about anxiety than your senses  being affraid of your own feelings and thoughts cause you think you cant handle  and so on. We always stay vigilant cause we think we are broken deep down. And that is what I believe that feeds the cycle  it is the ultimate compulsion.

I really believe that this is it. If you trusted yourself in the first place  even if your brain is geneticly wrong or not  as they say  you wouldn’t have a thought issue  that wouldn’t be in your radar.

Im 34 and I lived my life totally normal. Never even suspected what OCD was. 

I stopped trusting my mind and have symptons now. That is the story. Now  my goal is to trust myself again.

Ps: I started I CBT

OCD,I don't know what to do anymore and I'm feeling lost.,"I'm sorry if this isn't written the best  I just need to get it out. I have a loop in my head that is just unbearable. I have been diagnosed with anxiety  depression  OCD  PTSD  and autism has been suggested by a therapist. I have this unbearable loop in my head and I don’t know what to do. 

The loop is feeling like everything is scary and analysing the scariness but there’s no reason to feel scared so I feel broken and doomed and I analyse every thought to try to find an answer to why I feel so scared or depressed or anxious but I can’t find an answer because it’s probably an accumulation of things from my past or something (which I have analysed over and over on my own and in therapy) then I try to remember all my ACT techniques but it just feels like it’s something fundamental that techniques won’t help with and I’m sick of constantly trying to change and fix myself and the way I think. And I can't see a therapist anymore because it got to a point where I was obsessed with fixing myself and I would always have an appointment ready to go and would rely on him and it just stopped helping. I told him this in my last appointment and he said ""if we just push further and keep going I really think it could be great for you"" but I physically felt my brain shut down. I was so exhausted from trying to fix myself and over-analysing my past and everything. I tried seeing someone else but I had the same shut down. He called it ""treatment"" but I'm so sick of seeing myself as sick or broken. But also something has to change. I over analyse EVERYTHING then I get so upset and angry that I'm over-analysing and freak out. Then I freak out about freaking out. 

I've tried 2 medications in the past and all it's done is numb me which was awful and I kept having to up my dosage until I was at the maximum dosage. So I'm scared to try medication again. I feel like I'm driving myself completely insane. Like genuinely. 

It feels like actual torture and then I start to spiral into thinking I actually am being tortured and I’m in hell and that’s when it gets really bad and that’s kind of where I’m headed. If it feels like torture then who’s to say I’m not being tortured? And if I’m being tortured then I must be evil and a terrible person. And people I talk to combat this and say I’m a good person or it will change or I’m not being tortured or whatever but it won’t help. Talking about it is just another thing that doesn’t help because it feels like a cry for help but I don’t know what help I need or want and I can never get enough feelings out. I need help and I don't know what to do so if anyone has any answer or insight I'd be very grateful. Even though I know there is technically no answer and I should just learn to be okay with these thoughts. I'm so sorry for rambling. Thank you to anyone who has taken the time to read this.

OCD,Does anyone else act like someone is watching all of their online activity?,"Does anyone else act as though someone is silently watching and critiquing their actions? This applies to IRL actions but for me this also comes down to my online activity. When doing anything online I often act as though someone is or will eventually look through every message  post  search or action I've ever made and will be judging me for it. Whether it be a hacker  some government agency  or what have you. It causes me immense anxiety and often I worry about being embarrassed or exposed for something I may have said  posted  searched etc. At times I obsess over possibly having accidentally broken the law or having done something morally reprehensible and it feels as though it's only a matter of time before I am punished for it. It is a very ""walls are closing in"" type feeling. As you may imagine this makes it extremely difficult to make posts like these online. Something I often worry about is the expression ""if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to worry about."" I feel as though because I worry so much I must have something to hide. It often leaves me feeling like a secret criminal or degenerate. Is this a sentiment that is shared by anyone else who deals with these themes of OCD? (Namely Moral scrupulosity  cancellation  real-event  responsibility etc.) and if so  I'm curious what compulsions you engage in or how you learned to overcome these feelings. Thank you!

I keep having intrusive thoughts that have to do with disrespectful phrases about God and others  but the disrespectful intrusive thoughts about God really make me uncomfortable as I would never want to disrespect my creator.

Does anyone have any good ways of coping with intrusive thoughts and getting them to go away aside from just letting them come in and let them out?

OCD,I need help in relation to my parents.,"I am 20 years old  I have ocd since the age of 11  I have always tried to hide it as much as possible  but my parents have always noticed ""strange or repetitive"" behaviors in me.

Lately my ocd became very aggressive (a year and a half ago)  and that has made me very irritable and I have isolated myself as a consequence (and in a way as a compulsion  I move away from what gives me problems)  and my parents have noticed it and constantly ask me about that  I usually tell them that I am only stressed by the university  but apparently that does not convince them much and they know that something else happens to me.

I can't complain about my parents  we have suffered with money but they are very good  and they tell me to trust them and that I am not alone. My mother was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder like a year ago  and she thinks I have something like that. 

I have thought about telling them what happens to me  but I feel distrust and fear  they do not expect me to tell them I'm going crazy and I wouldn't like telling them  I don't know what would happen  I am ashamed of what they may think of me  but I need their help and they expect me to tell them something that I have not said.

I know I should tell them  but I don't want to.

OCD,I need help for exams,"I (15M) have recently been diagnosed with OCD  on top of my ADD. I have exams in around 21 days and I have my final IGCSE exams in 21 days (give or take). I cannot for the life of me even begin to fathom the concept of studying. I can't do ANYTHING without every 3 seconds having to do some dumbass twitch  or flex a muscle  or think a sentence or some other bullshit. I can't focus on what I'm doing and the smallest little thing will set me off into a spiral. I take a stimulant for my ADD and an anti-anxiety medication. I think that the stimulant enhances my OCD. So I either am unfocused and reckless (ADD) or have almost no control over my actions or thoughts (OCD). And since my ADD brain (now with a stimulant) wants more things to work with I'm watching the most (boring to others) random things and picking up and fact checking every little piece of information all while twitching all over every 3 seconds. If there is an itch I must scratch it. A thought? I must think it. A muscle? I must twitch it. I am lost  any guidance is much appreciated.

It always happens to me  and i kinda rely on my sleeping positions to like avoid those from happening  like if i sleep on my right  everything will be fine then seconds later my mind opposes and i need to sleep on my left immediately  then so it goes until i fall asleep without tryin to. 

i also have these thoughts abt dead celebrities and its even worse  like i really cant sleep at all  some several nights that i havent slept on  cause i always picture their faces which creeps the hell out of me  and feel like theyre around me  its crazy that im more afraid of them than some people who died in our village....

OCD,Feels like my family has no respect for me after my OCD diagnosis,"I’ve cried more the past few days than I have in a long time.  I am struggling to understand why my family cares so little about my genuine fears.  It’s like every word out of my mouth means absolutely nothing because they know I have OCD  and therefore whatever I say must be inherently unreasonable.  I was diagnosed almost three years ago.

A lot of my recent OCD revolves around my cats.  That being said  one of my cats gets into absolutely everything.  So these entirely reasonable fears and precautions get sucked up into the OCD spiral.

Yesterday my father knowingly vaped with my cats  and myself  in the car.  Today my brother  despite me calmly and politely asking him to not bring flowers into the house because of my cat  did anyway  then scoffed at me when I was bewildered why he would do that immediately after I just had a freaking conversation with him about why so many flowers are toxic.  And my beautiful  idiot cat immediately jumps on the table and shoves his face into them. 

I cleaned the entire house last night  and when he walked in I asked him to take off his shoes.  Again  he just scoffs and says “Yeah  I’m not doing that.”  Do they have so little respect for me that this is it?  No matter what I say or do  no matter how much progress or work I‘ve put into managing my OCD  nothing I say will ever matter again.

I can’t even describe how I feel.  It’s like they truly believe everything I say is absurd and “won’t happen ” and then time and time again something freaking happens because they can’t be bothered to not do something low effort.

OCD,came back years later to tell you guys i made it,"hey guys!

i was at a point in time where my OCD took up 80%+ of my thoughts each day. only when i wasn’t actively thinking or temporarily forgot was i not thinking about it.

i would obsess and do compulsions for hours into the night. i’ve had many OCD themes  mainly ROCD.

i would wake up jealous of the short time after my sleep where i wasn’t aware of my thoughts. i would sit at the bottom of the shower obsessing. my body only knew anxiety. that was every day. i never was given a break. i could not function. i could not work or do classes.

i didn’t think to make an update  but realized it could be encouraging to others here.

during the typical week now  OCD hardly or does not affect me.

i don’t wanna say i’m fully recovered  but im really comfortable and happy with where im at to where im not sure i would even meet a diagnosis for OCD anymore.

i’ll still get intrusive thoughts (rarely)  but i have the tools to deal with them and they last very shortly  and they don’t intrude in my life at all or cause much anxiety. most weeks or months im not affected at all and i feel peace. (any times i am is incredibly brief)

it took a lot. i was in therapy for over a year. i spent over 70 hours in ERP exposures (doing a little over a hundred exposures). i read two books which changed my life and applied and changed my thinking and philosophy around them. it was an every day thing where i applied myself fully.

for those of you who are doubtful  with enough work  changing your philosophy  and engaging your fears  it’s fully possible. no doubt.

i want to cry because i never imagined a day where i’d be here.

OCD,overthinking myself sick about my new job,Hi guys  I just need some support and any advice. My OCD is actually making me physically sick because I can’t stop overthinking. I am a licensed cosmetologist (since April last year) but I’m just now starting out my career. I’m about to start renting a space to do it… anyways I have a week until I start and I’m actually overthinking everything to the point of almost vomiting. I keep obsessing over every single negative  my boyfriend came home last night and I was crying to him about not knowing what quarterly taxes are. Thursday I was crying about the thought of running out of money  and Wednesday I was crying about the thought of overworking myself while having a chronic illness (I have a full time job  I’m doing hair on my off days) I have very little confidence in myself and didn’t have a very good mentor so I feel like I’m just figuring it all out on my own. All day everyday I’m obsessing over each tiny thing that could go wrong and I’m sucking the joy out of starting a career that I so desperately wanted to do! Every night I wake up 100 times because I’m so stressed my body can’t stay asleep  and then I just think all day so I can’t escape the overthinking. Everyone keeps telling me to calm down and that it’s gonna be great but they just don’t understand that my OCD makes me think of every single possible scenario that could go wrong so I can figure out a solution before it happens. If anyone has any advice on how to get my brain out of overdrive it would be greatly appreciated.,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1js2n3k/overthinking_myself_sick_about_my_new_job/
OCD,OCD/agoraphobia/pharmacophobia,"TLDR; My anxiety/agoraphobia/OCD is essentially ruining my life. But I have a phobia about medications  too  so I’m just withering away. Looking for words of encouragement or success stories to try and help motivate me to take the leap and take my medications.

Hi everyone  this is going to be obnoxiously long and likely all over the place. But I’m at my wits end. For context  I am a 28 year old F. I have a bunch of things I’m diagnosed with  however  my most severe and debilitating ones are OCD  panic disorder and agoraphobia. I also am petrified of any form of medication (hence the pharmacophobia in the title.) I also am finishing my masters degree in psychology and am a school counselor at an alternative school.

All of these things started around 6 years ago. Prior to that I’ve been on a plane  by myself and with others. I’ve driven to NYC and RI when I was younger. I used to be able to take advil if my head hurt or antibiotics if I needed… I’m not sure what happened. But suddenly everything changed. I started not being able to travel outside of my town. I stopped taking any medication for fear of having bad reactions or allergic reactions.. even though I’m not allergic to anything.

When I try and think deeply about where all of these things started I THINK I’m able to come up with a few ideas. When it comes to agoraphobia I believe it was just before Covid started. I was on my way home from a fair with my friend and we got lost. We were in an area with no service so the GPS wasn’t working and there weren’t any stores around. I had the most debilitating panic attack of my life. Then Covid happened and everything shut down. So I think that started to solidify the thought that leaving was bad???? When it comes to the medication.. the ONLY thing I can think of is this: I worked at an inpatient psychiatric unit for five years. While there I saw a few paradoxical effects of medications. If you’re unfamiliar it’s the opposite effect of a medication. I became so petrified of that happening to me and I was so scared of going through a psychosis.

Rationally  I know the likelihood of that happening is slim to nothing. And I know that even if it DID happen I would be able to get better once I stop taking that medication. But my irrational brain takes over and prevents me from taking anything.. I ended up in the hospital 3 years ago with a UTI and needed to take antibiotics. They gave me one in the emergency room and put in an order for me to pick up at pharmacy. I cheeked the one in the ER and spit it out when I got in my car. I was so petrified. I picked up the meds at the pharmacy and I did end up taking them. But every time I took them I would have a panic attack that lasted HOURS.

Now back to the agoraphobia. During covid I worked  about 3 minutes from home. So I would go to work and go home. I worked 3-1130 and would stay up most nights until 5/6am then sleep until 2:30 right before work. I never left my town because everything I need is there. My family  my job  stores I’d need  doctors office  everything. I never had a reason to leave.

I want to experience things. I want to travel again and go on a plane to Disney. I want to go see Hamilton on Broadway. I want to be able to drive the 25 minutes to the dang beach. And I can’t even drive to the next town over without hyperventilating and sobbing and having out of body experiences. It is so embarrassing. My cousin who lives in Texas called me the other day saying she got engaged and I’m a bridesmaid so she needs me to get there. When I feel pressure like that it makes me feel worse. It also makes me feel so ashamed or myself and guilty. My fiancée (who is AMAZING and has never pushed me out of my comfort zone and who understands and cherishes me) graduated college back in October and his graduation ceremony was about an hour away. I couldn’t go to that and I felt so disgusted with myself. His whole family came to my college graduation (same town that I live in) and I just felt awful I couldn’t go to his. I did watch the live stream of it and was so proud of him. His mom is wonderful  too  and never makes me feel bad. But I know his brother doesn’t love it because he doesn’t understand mental health.

I’m just at the point where I don’t know what to do. Well  no  I KNOW what to do  but I just can’t fucking do it because my brain hates my guts. I know I need to take my medication (prescribed sertraline daily and Ativan as needed) but I just fill the prescriptions and they sit in a drawer. I’m begging you please if you’ve had bad reactions to those meds don’t tell me because I will convince myself it will happen to me and make my chances of never taking them bigger. If you’ve have good reactions and they’ve helped though I’d be happy to hear about it if you’re comfortable sharing. I know the only thing that will help is the medication. I try exposure therapy but I get right over the border into the next town and turn around before I get to the point of a panic attack. I don’t think I’m ever going to get better. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to go into the city to see the aquarium or a concert. I don’t think I’ll be able to go to Disney ever or go to my cousins wedding. And I can’t stop crying every time I think about these things because I feel so useless. So unbelievably useless. To the point I’ve thought about leaving my fiancée so he can find someone that will be able to travel with him. I feel like I’m holding him back so much and it breaks my heart. I feel like I’m burdening my family because I can never go to events if they invite me  or if they want to do dinner they always have to come to me since they’ve all moved away. Not far  but not close enough for me to get to.

I convince myself on a regular basis I’m going to take my meds. I took two months off of work last year and used FMLA because I convinced myself if I didn’t have work I would be able to take my medications since I’d be at home and wouldn’t have to worry about calling out of work if the medications made me not feel good. I spent my whole 2 months off “tomorrowing” the meds. I never took them. I tried to even start with vitamins and I couldn’t even take the vitamins. Now that I work at a school I’ve convinced myself over the summer I will take my medication. But I’ve had the chances during all the school breaks to take them and haven’t. And what’s worse is when I was about 17 I took these same medications!!! I took sertraline and never had bad reactions to it. And it helped with my depression. But no matter how many times I remind myself I’ve taken it before.. my brain says “yeah but this time you’ll get sick or go into psychosis.”

My therapist said my OCD is what triggers these perseverating and intrusive thoughts. They literally play over and over in my head if I think about something that makes me anxious. From the second I wake up to the second I go to sleep. It’s so debilitating. And then I feel like a hypocrite because I convince other people to take their medications and help other people through their panic attacks but I can’t help myself. Like how messed up is that??? I don’t practice what I preach. Within the last year or two my OCD has started sending me into spirals when even other people are traveling somewhere. No clue where tf that stems from or why tf that had to happen. But if I know someone is going on a plane somewhere I will perseverate for weeks about it. It doesn’t matter if they say they’re going somewhere in six months… every day until that date comes I think about it and panic about it. And then when they’re there I panic some more and count the days until they get home. I imagine calling them and begging them to just come home early (doesn’t matter who it is. It could be someone I barely know). But I don’t do that obviously because the rational part of my brain is like “that’d be so embarrassing they’d talk about you doing that for the rest of your life.” A friend I’ve had for years and years told me last year she was moving to the UK within the next couple of years. Never told me a date or anything. But I stopped answering her after she told me and she blocked me on everything because of it. I was so anxious about knowing she was moving that I felt if I didn’t speak to her or see anything about her I would forget. You know  out of sight out of mind? Nope. I still wonder if she’s moved yet and panic about it. So I’m a terrible friend on top of everything else. Instead of just telling her I didn’t want to know when she leaves I became an awful person who ghosted her because I was more concerned about how embarrassing it would be to explain my anxiety.

I’m not really sure where else to go with this. There’s so much more I could say. But this is so raw and real and I’m being so vulnerable (which is scary to do on the internet) but I just don’t know where else to turn. Only select few people know just how deep my issues go.. I just really need some encouragement I guess??? If that’s even possible???? I feel as if I should’ve never gotten a psych degree because I can’t even help myself with one so why would I expect to be able to help other people?

Ugh okay I need to stop. Has anyone ever had anything even remotely similar? Or am I absolutely cooked?? I would love success stories to help motivate me to at least try the medications. Or other ways that you’ve overcome agoraphobia/OCD?",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1jliuzy/ocdagoraphobiapharmacophobia/
OCD,Has anyone with contamination OCD knowingly been exposed to a germ they're afraid of?,"Massive disclaimer: I haven't been diagnosed with OCD. I've been diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder in the past and haven't been to therapy since I've developed what I strongly suspect is contamination OCD (for context  it's noticeable enough that my friends/family comment on it). I do the excessive hand washing  ""mark"" things as dirty in my mind and will quarantine items that I've worn to the airport/other particularly germy locations  will have a ""clean"" and ""dirty"" hand and can't swap between them  and more.

It's been like this since the pandemic. Initially  it was Covid that I was terrified of catching. Since then  it's changed to norovirus/rotavirus - aka gastro-causing viruses. I'd always wondered what would happen if I was actually in a situation where I knew I had been exposed to these viruses. And then it happened. I was on a family holiday and one person got gastro  then it started spreading. It was genuinely horrifying. Ironically I vomited once  but it was purely from anxiety. I actually couldn't function for days (I was crying in a ball on the floor) and ended up having to change accommodation. The night before my flight home  I woke up every hour feeling nauseous (for context  an even more specific fear I have is that symptoms will start while on a flight). 

A few months later  my best friend from work had a bout of gastro over the weekend. I hadn't been to the office yet since I heard about this  and I ended up having to work from home the rest of the week (not a good look in my office) because I was too terrified to be near her.

Anyway  all of that is to say that when faced with these situations  my response has been even worse than what I'd feared. These days  I am generally doing a bit better. I'm really trying to face my fears by not washing my hands when I usually would  and then when I do this  trying hard not to fixate on the fact that I ate with unwashed hands for days later. But I still have the thought lingering in the back of my mind that I'll inevitably face more scenarios where I actually am knowingly exposed to the virus  and seeing how badly I've handled it in the past doesn't give me a lot of confidence. Has this been anyone else's experience? Or has anyone actually improved after having been exposed to their fear?",1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1j1lx55/has_anyone_with_contamination_ocd_knowingly_been/

OCD,Health anxiety,"I’ve had health anxiety since I was 13. For a long time it was manageable but lately I’ve gotten some kind of problem with my bladder that makes me feel like I have to pee all the time. At first it just ached and then the next day  I had to pee constantly. 

I don’t know what to say other this has ruined my life. I’m constantly spiraling now because of it. I almost have an anxiety attack every time I use the restroom. Last night it was really bad. I became almost instinctual with anxiety. It’s like my personality was gone and that all that was worry and fear. 

Im worried to death that I have bladder cancer. Why? Because when you google having the constant urge to urinate  that’s like the third thing to come up. Not the other dozen things that it could be. (Use this as strong advice to not google symptoms) I even had a urine test done at a clinic so if there was microscopic blood  they would have found it. My only problem is the urge to. The pain in the bladder area doesn’t affect me as much as it only confirms that there is a problem. 

Despite knowing it’s not something really bad I cannot stop my mind from spiraling. Even one moment I will be fine and thinking fine and then the next I will be on the bathroom floor  crying and gone. 

I’m going to look into a therapist as soon as possible. I can’t live this way. My girlfriend who is my main support in my life is getting back today from a vacation. So that will help a lot too. Hopefully I can figure this out through a doctor as well. 

Until my problem is fixed I need to know ways that I can stop the spirals and stay in my own head. I can’t even tell you what causes them. It’s just kind of like I lose connection to myself. 

I’ll take any advice. Even telling me how silly it is that my small problem is causing me all of this will do. I just can’t handle feeling like this. at times it’s like I’m a prisoner in my own mind. 

Also I am safe. I’m not at any kind of risk  especially now since my girlfriend will be back. 

Edit: I have zero history of anything at all in my family. In fact my family history is generally very very healthy. My grandmother is 94. 

Edit 2: My girlfriend got back and I went to her house. I feel like my room and home is a source of anxiety because of its possibly small rooms or the shitload of traumatic things that have happened there. She helped me a lot and have me a lot of reassurance. My urinary issues are still present but honestly not to the same extent. My main problem now is that I have to use more pressure to pee. The lessening of my symptoms are because of anxiety is set to 25% here. I don’t know what it is but getting out of my room and home and coming here changes my brain. 

Now since I’ve become less manic and read your comments I can say that I Probably don’t have cancer. I can’t say for sure because I don’t know for sure but I didn’t have any of the other cancers. We’ll see about this one. Despite this  I still definitely have a problem that I still need to find the cause of. 

Thanks everyone who has commented this far. I genuinely really appreciate it and it helped so much. You guys are all amazing. 
I’ll keep this updated for myself and anyone like me in the future. 

Edit 3: I’m not sure if this will work for anyone in the future who finds this but something I use to put things into perspective is to think about the amount of people you know. Think about how many of them have got cancer. If you’re my age I cannot think of any. One of my friends has diabetes but even that is rare and ran in his family. 

I think about movies or shows. I think about their cast and think about how many of them are alive. Most of the time all of them are.

My point is that the internet makes it seem much more common than it really is. Mostly on a site like this where there are communities dedicated to those with X disease. 

Also if you’re reading this another piece of advice is that you have health anxiety which is a disorder where you worry about your health or convince yourself that you have diseases. Have you had the others? 

Edit 4: Well it’s been three days now and my symptoms have pretty much subsided. I suppose I might not have any of the terrible things I convinced myself that I did. I did have a night sweat the other night which triggered me but that’s sort of a semi regular thing and unrelated. My point is that I’m alright. I’m getting better mentally over time but I’m still dealing with leftover anxiety. This was the worst I have ever been in my life but I got through it even when it really felt like it would never end. If you find this and are going through what I was know that you’re alright. You have health anxiety just like me and just like me you will get through this. I know it’s scary and it feels like it won’t end but I promise that it will. Go to the doctor and get whatever tests you need done to tell yourself that you’re okay but know that in the end you will be. ",17,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1bi4s0k/health_anxiety/

OCD,I don't know how to overcome OCD and its making me hate my life ,My ocd feels like the death of me  I feel like I'm crazy.  I really need advice from anyone who's willing.  I can't even make my own decisions.  I spend like 5 hours a day of chat gpt because its someone that's always there to listen to me and I don't feel crazy talking to.  I recently gave my life to Jesus  and I don't regret it at all it just seems my ocd is now 100 times worse than ever because now that I am not living for me anymore  I watch every move I do sooo much more because I'm so terrified of sinning.  I have tried going and talking to someone and it doesn't help me then I tried antidepressants  and I didn't like those either because they make me even more numb than anything.  I have found that a nightly weed edible helps me drastically  but it makes me feel like I can't go one night without it because I'm on a one-day break right now and my ocd is horrible like I don't know how I use to just deal with it.  I was asked if I could come into work today and I overthought if I should for 3 and a half hours.  Yet I still know I can stop whenever I need to because I have many times.  I don't know what to do  I am so stressed because I have one thing that truly helps me  but I don't know if I'm sinning when partaking or what please help me I don't know what to do.  I can't make one decision without stressing about it for hours I'm praying 100-150 times a day asking for forgiveness (when on breaks from  edibles) because I feel like I've sinned even though I know I haven't it just makes me feel better I am so stressed right now I don't know how to cope.  Even last night I just felt maybe I should try and moderate my weed use a little more even though I only use it at night and then I prayed about it and then stresses about what moderation meant to me for 6 hours and kept waking up.  Am I an evil person for using weed at night to keep my mind in check form my mental health I always make sure I have everything done for the day before partaking.  what do I do I need help. ,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1hwtz01/i_dont_know_how_to_overcome_ocd_and_its_making_me/
OCD,I fucking hate this and I want my old life back,I always had OCD and it was manageable. Until a few months ago when I finally began to develop intrusive thoughts and my OCD became severe. I fucking hate it and what it has done to me. I feel constantly disgusted  guilty and ashamed  I’m full of anxiety in case one of these days I somehow agreed with or acted on these thoughts. I’ve developed a tic and my other compulsions have increased. I’ve started medication and it’s helped somewhat but I really wish OCD would just get to fuck and leave me be.

OCD,Contamination OCD is taking over my life and I hate it,"Contamination OCD is taking over my life 

Hi  i’ve been struggling with OCD ever since 2015  back then it was mild now it has gotten so severe. I think that everything has germs Im not supposed to touch or cross-mix and I wash my hands after everything in fear there are dirty germs on them. Most of my fear of germs stem from bathroom waste  so I’m not necessarily too obsessive about clutter and messiness  but more fearful about germs from the bathroom spreading through my house and getting on me. I have other forms of OCD  and other rituals/idiosyncrasies that I follow but this is the main one that is quite literally taking over my entire life  to the point it interferes with work  having friends and healthy relationships.

What can I do? I don’t want to live like this anymore. ",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1gn2ak9/contamination_ocd_is_taking_over_my_life_and_i/

OCD,I hate OCD. Its ruining my life.,"I'm so depressed. I'm a hopeless romantic but because of my ROCD i basically cant be in relationships. They just cause me such severe anxiety that its constant panic attacks and losing sleep and its stressful for both me and any potential partner.

I have a crush on this guy and he likes me back but I know we cant date  and I've told him that. Because it would just be painful for both of us. But recently he's been talking about this girl at his job and i hate myself for being jealous. Because its my own fault. I'm the one who can't handle the anxiety and uncertain of the relationships.

I was already having a terrible day because of my job going shitty and I'm being a failure  and my OCD telling me nobody will love me because I'm nonbinary  and then he messaged me just to talk about her  and it honestly broke the camel's back. 

I've been feeling so awful lately. I don't know if I'm built for this lifetime. People keep telling me it gets better. When? Maybe some people aren't meant to live a life or be happy. ",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1b2l3lm/i_hate_ocd_its_ruining_my_life/
OCD,"Life long insecurity  self hate  imposter syndrome  basically like a ""self existence dysmorphia"" has been ruining my entire life. I wish I knew how others perceived me","I dont even know where to start.  
  
I keep trying to write this but it just seems like im stroking my ego. I know there are so many people that actually have shitty circumstances but its like my brain is stuck in this weird spot where I cant accept what I have.   
  
Im doing great at work. It seems like most coworkers and my boss love me. I can fuck around as much as I want (within reason) and the boss never really gets mad at me as long as I clean up which I do. I play hard  I work hard. If any issues do come up he usually takes my side with little consideration.   
  
I have friends that I know genuinely care about me with things they've done or said throughout the years.  
  
I dont understand why its so hard to accept this.   
  
For some reason I always felt like the last pick for everything and like I was useless.  
  
My parents HATED that I was a very energetic  loud  and expressive child so maybe now I force myself to hide that?  
  
Im super shy and quiet and I hate that about myself. The few people I trust know how loud and rowdy I get but everyone sees this hidden reserved side of me which I attribute to my parents always calling me an embarrassment basically?  
  
They never praised me for my good work. If I ever did anything good the usual answers I got  are ""why didn't do more?"" or ""you want to be noticed/rewarded for something you're already supposed to be doing.""  
  
I also know that I used to be a huge fucking bully back in elementary school. idk why but I loved pissing people off I guess. pretty much all of my current friends told me that when they first met me I'd bully and pick at them.  
  
I think this gave me very little friends  and the perception that I was just unlikeable? Obviously that shit fucked me up throughout higher grades and I was super quiet and shy thinking people hated me for no reason.  
  
Now im nice and care for people  work hard and people seem to like me and all I can think of is how they're all faking it to be nice for some reason.  
  
Maybe its cuz I bullied people  maybe its cuz my parents were kinda jerks  but I grew up thinking I was worthless and unlikeable.   
  
But now im working hard on my socializing with people and general work ethic and people like me. People invite me to hangouts  people initiate conversation with me  they dont seem grossed out or anything by my presence and its just really hard to accept.   
  
I keep thinking like ""I just need one more person to say something nice about me"" but I've had that SO many times already. I worked really hard to get where I am but I cant accept it.   
  
I kinda wish there was a way to know how people view me.   
  
I see attractive people  smart people  funny people  and everyone gets their own little like general personality ""tab.""  
  
The smart friends that always have answers for everything  the funny friends that seem to be  entertaining with zero effort  the insanely charismatic and adventurous ones that take charge and have an adventure every meet up.   
  
What the fuck am I?  
  
In my head im some like awkward little dude that kinda hides and people are slightly uncomfortable to be around.  
  
I wish I just had a way to know how others saw me.  
  
I can infer from what people tell me but I can never be too sure and that uncertainty usually turns to doubt and then self hatred again.  
  
Like are there people that respect me? Are there people that notice how funny I am or at least try to be/think I am  are there people who think im just stupid or maybe goofy on purpose? Are there people that respect me for the work I do or do they know im more or less guessing/faking it and making it look good?  
  
Its just that I have so many like opinions about people. What they're good at  what they're bad at  how they loo  all this and that.  
  
It kills me not knowing how others see me and what they think of me.  
  
I guess I could ask  but thats kinda pathetic and usually warrants some fake ass bullshit. ""yeah man you're great we love you haha."" ",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1alo9j2/life_long_insecurity_self_hate_imposter_syndrome/

OCD,Anyone experience ocd induced breakdowns or anxiety attacks,"My son has extremely severe ocd. But it’s different from anything I’ve seen before.  

He has typical ocd symptoms where he wants things to be perfect  especially in school. He doesn’t want to make any mistakes. 

The thing that’s different  though  is if he does make a mistake he completely loses it. He starts hyperventilating and crying. He says his life is ruined and everyone hates him.  It takes him a long time to calm down and this happens everytime he makes a mistake  in anything.  Benzos do help him calm down but it’s not a long term fix. 

He’s on clomipramine and luvox and we started ketamine. It definitely helps  without medication he probably couldn’t be in school. But it’s such a big issue. He’s in 7th grade and cries in class all the time. I don’t know what’s left to do for him. I’ve started looking at gamma knife. 

It’s just so strange. I have ocd too but nothing like his. I’ve never seen ocd where someone has such extreme breakdowns. Is there something else this could be  another disorder?

OCD,ok I am so close to having a panic attack because I just found out the one thing I fear the most might be true (tw health anxiety & contamination ocd),"I've been struggling with health anxiety since I was a child and contamination ocd since I was 15. I'm 19 (F) now. my main obsession is viruses and the second I fear the most are inherited diseases. 

my grandma was diagnosed with Alzheimer's this year  but my family was suspecting since 2023. I've got to a mini depressive state because of it and fortunately it soon ended and I was able to take a few steps for a healthier life (I started the gym and have been consistent with it). 

this year I have unintentionally hyperfocused in prion diseases and I try so hard to not think about it. since my grandma is staying in my home due to a surgery in her elbow  I have to help taking care of her. this would be no problem if it weren't for my ocd. but yesterday I researched again on Alzheimer's and I've found discussions whether it can be caused by prions and if it can pass to one person to another and I've been on a rabbit hole of reading and thinking and panicking.

I want to isolate myself so hard  to burn my house down just to feel safer  to be so far away from everyone and everything to feel somewhat safe. ",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1enipk5/ok_i_am_so_close_to_having_a_panic_attack_because/

OCD,I had a massive panic attack over a surprise trigger. Advice welcome.,"Hello everyone 

I waited several days to post this because I needed to ensure I wasn’t reassurance seeking and am posting with clarity. 

A couple of days ago  my son had a performance at his school and I needed a shower. We’ve had bad storms in the Midwest and we were at the peak of the worst this day. I’ve always heard you shouldn’t shower during thunderstorms because you could get electrocuted since I was a kid  and I’ve never tried. However  I *really* needed this shower  so I followed our local theme parks (that I used to work at) rules for lightning  and checked to make sure it was at least 10 miles out from my location. It was 12 miles away  so I felt safe enough to do a quick wash with no frills. 

The second I got in the shower I started panicking and every rumble of thunder was like predicting my death. I just kept imagining getting electrocuted and dying in the shower  leaving my naked ass body for one of my kids to find. The same scenario would flash on repeat with every thunder rumble. I was sobbing and panicking and hiding in the corner of my shower as I washed and conditioned my hair and I think when all was said and done  I was out within 5 minutes. 

By the time I turned the water off I was shaking to the point my husband had to come get me and help me calm down. It took me about 3 hours to stop shaking completely. 

I usually have decent control over my triggers and can calm myself down  but this time was different. I knew lightning was definitely part of my OCD ruminations as it contributed partially to me not working at the theme park anymore since there were several freak lightning strikes  one that happened in front of me to a security guard I was close with  but it’s never affected me so viscerally before. 

I do not have insurance anymore so I am unmedicated and do not have a therapist anymore. I would love some coping skills to deal with this besides just not showering in storms (which is ideal regardless) as this affects me in a productivity way as well (I don’t leave my house and will cancel things if there are storms  I just always thought this was more practical rather than an OCD avoidant thing). 

Any advice is welcome and appreciated. Thanks in advance!

OCD,Ever since my panic attacks 3 years ago  I’ve had non stop fears of travel  my emotions and my thoughts. Been dissociated 24/7 since.,"I'll keep it short. Lots of trauma from a very young age. Had 3-4 back to back panic attacks in summer 2022  I had anxiety attacks before but never full blown panic attacks. These lasted 3-4 hours each and I couldn't get my nervous system to calm down. After that last one  I woke up the next day completely disconnected from reality  my body  my memories etc. I thought I had died for months until I learned it was DPDR. I had intrusive thoughts for the first time about reality  and everything being unreal. I spent a year with severer agoraphobia - never feeling safe etc. I worked super hard to overcome those fears  panic attacks.. but 3 years later I still have DPDR  and many other cPTSD symptoms. I've learned to just observe my thoughts and not over analyze them. But I still have severe existential OCD because of the unreal numb state I live in 24/7.

I have a very irrational fear of traveling like this. I feel unreal. Unsafe. Like I said ground myself in reality. I haven't been able to get out of DPDR and it makes me so unwilling to travel because of the existence fears. When I was a kid I was terrified of a meteor hitting the earth at night and would obsessively make sure I knew everything about how we would be safe from one hitting the earth in the middle of the night. I couldn't even lol at the night sky without panicking. It seems like my existential anxiety goes way back - but I'm an adult now that needs to live a life and be able to travel. I just don't feel real  safe or grounded. My mind replays these same thoughts over and over all day. I traveled all the time before this and never felt unsafe. I have these fears because DPDR has detached me from all my emotions and feelings; but I still refuse to travel.

OCD,Nocturnal Panic Attacks and OCD,"Hello. Just joined this group. I have OCD and have also been experiencing intermittent nocturnal panic attacks for about 20 years. (I'm in my late 60s). The nocturnal panic attacks don't seem to fit the description I seem to find most commonly  which describe night sweats  a sense of dread  and racing heartbeat. Mine are much more in line with OCD itself. A dream or repetitive thoughts always precede them  but they're not scary dreams. For example  the most recent  which occurred last week  was about my using some sort of plastic blocks  each with a letter on it  to create words  like an anagram game. Not scary at all! But I was obsessed with the game and the words and the letters. I had a sense of being TRAPPED in my own mind  utterly unable to escape. That sense of entrapment  to the point of claustrophobia  is the most salient feature of this sort of attack. THAT is the panic that wakes me up  and I throw off the covers and run out of the room. That sensation of being trapped in my own mind is so freaking frightening.

I am wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar. Again  it's been almost impossible to find any discussion of this sort of attack online. Thanks in advance.",4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1jkd42e/nocturnal_panic_attacks_and_ocd/

• Obsessive rumination around a guy I crushed on for 6 years in elementary school  literally feeling consumed by my obsession with him and not being able to think about anyone else

• An extreme fear of a natural disaster happening  to the point of crying 

• Excessive and extreme worrying around my stomach growling in class and forcing myself to drink 1L of water during every break

• Following a very specific routine before school 

• Throwing tantrums and feeling extremely anxious when said routines were disrupted 

• Repeating sentences and words continuously in my head for days / hearing a sentence from a song or a TV program and having my brain repeat that in my head for days and not being able to make it stop 

• Prayers getting disrupted by hearing profanity in my head and thinking my prayer was invalid and having to do it again

OCD,Your OCD theme is irrelevant,"One of the most important things I've learned (and often don't remember) about OCD is that the content /theme is irrelevant. It's a misfiring signal from your brain that is sending the thoughts and your reaction to this is the problem.

You might have contamination OCD and get the thought that you've got germs on your hands  even after washing them 20 times. Another person might have scrupulosity and say the same prayer 50 times to try and get it right. It doesn't matter what the theme is  it's all a misfiring of the brain  and our erroneous reactions to these misfirings that is the real problem.

I often catch myself spending maybe hours trying to solve a problem  which when ""resolved"" just generates another. If  every time  I remembered that the content is irrelevant  and just lived with the uncertainty  fear  etc  this would eventually show my brain that bad things aren't gonna happen and I can just continue with my day

OCD is like dominoes. You  knock down one (compulsion) and end up setting off a chain reaction. This can lead to an obsessive loop and feelings of emptiness  depression etc.

I want to focus on just letting the thoughts be there  whatever the content  because the content doesn't matter. This way I hope to fix my broken brain",749,134,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/mu7x0f/your_ocd_theme_is_irrelevant/
OCD,I’m an idiot who left his clothes without watching them  someone touched them  they’re dirty now and I just want to cry,"I’m at my college dorm laundromat. I’m the one who fucked up. It’s late  there only me left in the laundromat doing the laundry along with another guy using the dryer. My washing machine was over and since there were five other washing machines that weren’t be used I didn’t bother to take out my clothes out of the one I was using. At some point a girl came in  I didn’t bother to look up since there were other washing machines. A few minute later I look up and I see her with half my clothes on the top of the machine  emptying the one I was using so she can use it herself. I can’t deal with people touching my clothes. I can’t deal with people touching my things at all. I always separate things  with things that are “inside” and things that are “outside” and the two cannot cross no matter what happens. Those were supposed to stay inside. She touched them too. I just want to cry. I can’t deal with people touching my stuff or me. I have to wash myself every single time again and again to the point where my skin is bleeding. I’m such an idiot I should have put them out. They’re dirty now. I won’t be able to do more than one round of washing machine again too  the landromat is closing in one hour. I don’t know what to do. They’re dirty I can’t put them back. I’ve been in therapy for a few years  I’m on meds too but I haven’t reached that level

OCD,I feel like without OCD I can't think critically and I feel empty inside.,"First I want to thank the people who responded to my post last night. It really helps. I have been trying to think about my issues.

I think the main problem of my OCD is and that has been messing with my ever since I was 10 is the fact that if I try to not give in and not do compulsions or obsess in my head about what is bothering me  I feel like I am not able to think hard about things if that makes any sense. Basically at this point my obsessions can trigger about anything  be it what are emotions  why do people do things  why do people have different opinions from me and things like that. Well if I try to not let my compulsions rule me I feel like I can't think about anything seriously or for a length of time. It's like my brain turns off and I can't have opinions about anything. It makes me feel like I have the IQ of a toddler at times. I try not to give serious thouhts to anything any more because when I do I will turn it into an obsession. 

It's been like that since I was 10 years old and I'm 27 now. I literally do not have any other way of functioning. I have been living in my head all these years. So whenever I try not to give in I feel depersonalized  empty and stupid. Is this how I'm always going to be from now on? Even if I cure my OCD have I done unrepairable damage to my brain? I don't feel human. I don't know what it is like to feel human. I also have either very weak or non existent emotions ever since the OCD began. I don't feel strong happiness or sadness. Every other emotion is non existant. I don't feel love or anger over anything. I always had to pretend like I do to my family and friends. And I intellectually know it is bad and sometimes feel mild guilt but it never lasts long.

I feel like I have to have the worst case of ocd ever. It has robbed me of my humanity and I just feel like a robot going through the motions.",8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/c404ed/i_feel_like_without_ocd_i_cant_think_critically/

OCD,Has anyone else dealt with food fears from health OCD?,"(TW for mentions of eating disorders + health issues)

Hi guys  I’ve been dealing with pretty bad health related OCD recently. I’ve been finding it hard to eat enough  I’m scared of eating the wrong thing and giving myself something horrible like appendicitis (even though I know it doesn’t work like that)  or gallstones or something. Appendicitis and abdominal problems have been my main obsessions recently  because I’ve been having unknown abdominal pain and my husband just recently had his appendix removed. 

I don’t have an eating disorder necessarily  I’m not eating like this because I want to lose weight or anything. In fact I wouldn’t mind gaining weight. Truthfully I’m just really struggling to find things to eat that feel safe enough for me to eat them. Every time I eat I wonder “what if this causes appendicitis?” and then I can’t eat the food. It’s just a fear-related problem. Anything greasy I eat ends with me poking and prodding my abdomen to make sure my gallbladder is okay. I’ve been counting my calories to make sure I’m eating a bare minimum of 1 200 calories a day but I’m finding it difficult to hit that goal somedays  because food just feels unsafe. 

This is related to my health OCD  correct? I’m assuming it is because it kinda seems like it follows the same patterns as other OCD themes  but truthfully I don’t really understand myself enough. I have been diagnosed with OCD for a while now  as well  so I’m inclined to believe this is caused by OCD more than anything else. Is this something where I should expose myself to eating the foods that scare me occasionally? I can’t think of any other way out of this except exposure and realizing that these foods won’t harm me. I also know I have to stop poking my abdomen and checking it for appendicitis or any form of pain. Has anyone else dealt with this? Thank you for any help!

OCD,Autism was misdiagnosed as OCD - My realisations,"This is a general post to explain what I have realised over the past couple of months  as well as to thank the people of this community for the help and responses at a time I did not know what to do. I since deleted my posts but know I am grateful still.

Last December  I started treatment for OCD. It was pushed a bit by my health provider  who saw my symptoms and had concluded they were compulsions that originated from intrusive thoughts. I have a strong need for things to go a certain way  to always know what to expect and can get really upset and anxious when life deviates from what I think is “how it should be”.

Friends of mine have OCD. We have had many conversations about the subject and although what we feel and experience is very similar in many ways  I always felt like their experience and mine were different enough for me to doubt whether I had OCD. My health provider gave me the feeling that going against his views and the proposed treatment (exposure therapy) was proof said treatment was what I needed.

At the time  I reached out within this community  worrying about what to do and to hear your thoughts. Turns out that after proper testing  I’m actually autistic (officially diagnosed well into my twenties) and the subtle yet important differences between Autism Spectrum Disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder are still fascinating and wild to me.

In both there is a need for control in order to try and feel safe. With OCD (or at least  this is my understanding of it  always feel free to correct me) this feeling of safety is temporary and it reinforces potentially unhealthy habits in an attempt to fight mental urges that can’t be helped. For autistic people  this need for control comes from having experienced emotional pain or mental distress caused by sensory processing issues in the past  which they’re trying to prevent from experiencing again. 

Autistic people’s routines aren’t created to try and ease fears  but any deviation from it may lead to anxiety. Both people with OCD and ASD show repetitive behaviour  but for OCD these are compulsive in nature  and although autistic people are more likely to show compulsive behaviour than neurotypical people  this behaviour doesn’t derive from intrusive thoughts. Both are more likely to be insecure and have a low self-worth. Both tend to ruminate  but for different reasons. Both tend to think in “what if’s”  but for people with OCD this stems from either an irrational fear or a rational fear that was pulled out of proportion  while for autistic people  it comes from past  lived experiences that resulted in hurt.

In general  I think the biggest difference is that people with OCD act to ease anxiety  while autistic people may feel anxious not being able to act the way they intend to. Which is SUCH a blurry line it is hard to make sense of it  especially for outsiders. Not to speak of there being a high comorbidity between the disorders. 

I spent months doubting taking action because I relate to so many OCD symptoms. Thinking … either could be true. What made me realise I don’t have OCD is how easy it is for me now to let go of things I desperately held on to in the past  as long as I’ve been given the time to process changes or the ability to justify and understand them. 

I will not pretend I know what it is like to have OCD. I do empathise deeply and can to and extent imagine. In the end  talking about OCD made me better understand both myself and my friends  and I think that’s why I wanted to share my thoughts here. To highlight the subtle differences and major similarities  so we may all understand ourselves and each other a little better.",74,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1de5goc/autism_was_misdiagnosed_as_ocd_my_realisations/
OCD,Germophobia / contamination OCD,"Hi guys! I'm writing to ask for some advice  as life has become particularly hard for me lately. I suffer from Generalised Anxiety Disorder and am presently organising to consult a psychiatrist for OCD. 

I am nearly 2/3 through my (very challenging) one-year MSc  and I am lonely  homesick  and experiencing consistently high levels of anxiety. My (suspected) OCD is aggravated by my living conditions (I live in a horrible  mouldy flat with faulty plumbing and slugs coming in through the windows) which manifests physically in painful eczema (too much hand washing). I have one real (non course-mate) friend in the next town over  who I only see some weekends. I live with one other girl who does not understand or share my worries (is quite messy) and seems fed-up with me.

I am struggling to see the light at the end of the tunnel (and I don't know how long the tunnel is - I am going to request for the uni to let me write my dissertation from home from June-August  but am terrified they will not let me  in which case I am not allowed to be away from my (very isolated) uni town for more than 14 days). I am trying to move out of my flat  (I desperately want to be rid of it) but I am not sure the agency will let me replace myself this late into the term (and I am depending on my housemate to get one of her friends in  but she doesn't seem to want to act with the appropriate urgency (which I get is not really her responsibility)). 

Lately  it has gotten so bad that every time I walk home the anxiety rises in me  and it's gotten to the point where anytime I even think about my flat I feel full-body anxious.

I would like to hear from anyone who has felt similarly trapped - in their living situation and/or their OCD thoughts/rituals. How do I not view my flat as a minefield? Does anyone know any tricks or tips to curate a 'safe-space' in their mind? Or to ignore some of the more distressing thoughts they have no control over? 

Thanks for reading this guys  any words of advice or support would be very much appreciated.

OCD,Help if you can..,"I don’t even know where to begin  but I feel like I need to let this out. For what feels like forever  I’ve been trapped in a relentless cycle of negative thoughts that just won’t leave me alone. Every single day  I’m haunted by the same questions: What’s the point of my life? Why am I even here? The thought of ending it all has become a constant presence in my mind. It feels like I spend more time planning for my death than I ever do planning for a future.

I’m completely drained—emotionally  mentally  and physically. I’ve lost all my energy and motivation. I’ve stopped working  not because I don’t want to  but because I can’t even find the strength to get out of bed. Talking to people feels impossible. Things that once mattered to me  things I used to enjoy  now feel completely meaningless. I’ve isolated myself  trapped in my own head  unable to escape.

There are times when I feel like I’m suffocating  as if the air has been pulled out of my lungs. I can’t even catch my breath properly  especially when I realize I’ve spent another day alone  doing nothing. The pressure in my chest feels so heavy that I’m convinced it’s going to crush me. And sometimes  even when I do try to speak  I feel like the words are stuck inside me  and I can’t get them out.

I’ve noticed that talking to someone—just having a conversation—offers a brief sense of relief. It distracts me  gives me something to focus on other than the endless storm of negative thoughts. But those moments of peace don’t last long  and the heaviness always comes back.

Anxiety  fear  and stress have taken over my life. Every single day feels heavier than the last. Even the idea of leaving the house or going somewhere terrifies me. I feel frozen  like I’m too scared to move. And to make it worse  I can’t shake the feeling that people around me are just using me—that I’m only useful to them when they need something  and once they get it  I’m left alone again. The relationships I thought I could depend on have become sources of pain.

I’ve reached a point where I hate everything. I hate myself. I hate people. I hate life. And it’s not just hate—I don’t even feel emotions anymore. No happiness  no sadness  just emptiness. There’s this huge void inside me  and no matter what I try  I can’t fill it.

I know people always say  “Try to think positively ” but it’s so much easier said than done. I do try. I really do. But the negative thoughts always win. They’re louder  stronger  and more overwhelming.

I’m not sharing this for pity or attention. I’m sharing this because I genuinely need help. If there’s anyone out there who has felt like this—who has been in this darkness and made it out the other side—please  tell me how. How do you escape this? How do you start living and feeling again?

Even the smallest word  the tiniest piece of advice  could mean everything to me. It could be the difference between holding on and letting go.

Thank you to anyone who reads this  and to anyone who takes the time to respond. Just knowing that someone out there is listening might be the first step toward saving my life.",5,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1ic5ql3/help_if_you_can/
OCD,OCD with my unmanageable little boy ,"Hello everyone 

I have suffered from severe OCD for years  (my bodily secretions and the soil)  but with the birth of my son in 2021  the soil contamination OCD became unmanageable. It is even more unbearable since I have been withdrawing from psychotropic drugs (because of the anxiety generated by withdrawal).

My son is now 3.5 years old and it's worse than anything. He is very small  and of course he spends his time on the floor  mainly playing  but also rubbing himself on the floor often  and also when he is constipated and gets on the floor to push. In the end  he is on the floor much more often than on a chair  the sofa or his bed. The problem is that it's torture for me. Because as soon as it hits the floor (which isn't always perfectly clean because I'm in withdrawal and my partner takes care of everything)  I find it dirty... It's atrocious  because he comes to touch me  I want to take him in my arms  and I feel soiled. Everything he touches in the apartment is then dirty and I end up in prison  if you know what I mean. The apartment cannot be permanently disinfected  and that would be useless since my son is always on the floor... So  I disinfect myself 15 000 times a day and it's unbearable. 

I'm currently in withdrawal  so I can't start therapy. However  the anguish and suffering are unbearable and I absolutely don't know how to deal with it. I don't even know what's normal anymore... Everyone agrees that the shoes are a little dirty. But my son walks around the house with it for a bit  and then he walks around barefoot or in socks  that's how he feels comfortable.  His feet are not necessarily clean and he gets on his bed  on our bed. It's inevitable  I know it well. But I don't even know if this is normal  and how a normal parent reacts.

Do you have any advice? This is all so painful! Thank you so much.",2,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1i0p2jf/ocd_with_my_unmanageable_little_boy/
OCD,How to handle OCD as a parent.,"Hi 
I'm a parent to a 14-year old son with OCD. And I'm a clinical psychologist that definitely understands the illness on a academical level. But Im stuck in a situation where my son does not want to get help from anyone. He knows he has OCD  he has appointments with a psychologist that specialised in OCD. But he does not want to go. He seems to cling to the hope that one day it will just get better.

I try to help but my frustration takes over and i alternate between being irritated or enabling him just to get him out the door in time for school. Sometimes i manage to support him through the intrusive thoughts  but often I dont have the time or energy to do that. It's just too tiresome because it's never ending. He is just in so much pain all the time. It's tough to be his parent  but it's obviously absolutely horrible to be in him.
And the OCD is getting worse.

Do anyone have a story to tell about how to support someone with OCD in a good way? How to be someones support without enabling? How to help someone see that there might be a way to make it better. 
Ive read some post about parents handling it in a bad way  and i do recognize my own behavior in these posts. But how do one handle it in a good way? Im in desperate need of positive examples.

For reference the thoughts and compulsions circles around contamination  cleanliness  dying suddenly of heart failure and getting fat. So cleaning of the house  preparation and consumtion of food and drink  washing clothes  sleep (dying during sleep)  having guests over (even family) is tough situations that makes us face this all the time  every day.",1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1ja8mnf/how_to_handle_ocd_as_a_parent/

I can't function  and everything I fail at doing because of it just adds to the guilt I'm feeling and feeds into it  making it all worse.

OCD,can you get pregnant from semen on toilet paper,"so  i think i may have had an accident  im not sure but its worrying me  i think i mightve ejaculated in my sleep  but it was dried up and when i went to the bathroom i touched a bunch of stuff with my ""infected??"" hand of semen im not too sure if there was on my hand or it mightve been dried but say it wasnt dried and i touched the toilet paper and im scared someone would get pregnant by using the toilet paper so i rolled off as much toilet paper as possible but not too much so it would waste the whole role of toilet paper and about 40 minutes later someone used the bathroom. help please is someone gonna get pregnant??


UPDATE: i thought about this post earlier today and thought i would clarify what happened a bit more. i may have overexaggerated  there was no white gooey stuff on my hand (i wanted to make that clear) but the reason i was stressing was because i had just taken a piss and was scared because i had just woken up and my im not sure at all if it was a wet dream i had  cant remember  but i do remember i was trying really hard to be careful of what i touched and with which hand i used to touch stuff  (because i didnt want the ""infected"" hand anywhere near anything).  i've realised how stupid of a question this was  i posted it out of stress and scared.

i wanted to make this update just to clarify and also just because i'm always scared of people not understanding my initial post  reason for overexaggeration was because i wanted to know of if there was a possibility of pregnancy even at the lowest possible outcome. (i dont know if that makes sense) but nobodys pregnant so you all were right

thank you for all the advice and responses  i did post this on another subreddit so i just wanted to edit both thanx all",210,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1ar9ews/can_you_get_pregnant_from_semen_on_toilet_paper/
OCD,someone told me to think of ocd as a superpower,"so yea i had mentioned something about my ocd online and then someone basically said that i should look at it as a super power because it makes me organized and because it would make me happier in the long run

it just made me so mad and now im crying and i dont even know why. i would do anything to get rid of this and just live normally. ive tried to end my life in the past because the pain of living with severe anxiety and ocd was so bad that i would rather just be dead and yet nobody seems to actually understand what ocd even is. i know this shouldnt bother me this much  i just hate how little people understand actually understand about ocd and what its like living with it",129,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1ekpz6w/someone_told_me_to_think_of_ocd_as_a_superpower/
OCD,It gets so much better,"Today I realized I haven’t looked at this sub in about 2 years and wanted to make a quick post to say… it gets so much better. 

From 2018 - 2022 OCD ruled my life. My themes generally focused on Harm OCD  Health anxiety and the absolute undefined worst theme Existential OCD. Occasionally I would slip into other themes so I’ve experienced it all. 

I ruined 2 relationships by constantly seeking reassurance and being crippled by fear. I was a broken man and wasn’t optimistic about my future at all. 

Fast forward to today and I almost feel normal again. I’m happy  I’m not controlled by OCD anymore  I’m confident and I’m optimistic about the future. 

If you’re struggling just know  it gets so much better.

Here’s what I did to get to this point.
1. Find a therapist that understands OCD and begin ERP. If you are in the US I found mine through psychology today and filtered by OCD. Call them and talk to them before you purchase a session  make sure it’s a fit. This is expensive  I drained my savings and worked odd jobs to afford treatment but it’s an investment that will literally change your life. Make the sacrifice if you can.
2. Educate yourself on OCD through books and podcasts.
3. Exercise
4. Work on yourself. Get in a routine. Much of my anxiety came from a deep disappointment in myself for the decisions I was making. When I changed my habits and switched to a more suitable career a lot of that weight was lifted from me. 
5. Get off this sub when you establish care. Nobody healed is on here.
6. Seek discomfort. If you’re triggered sit in that fear   don’t look for reassurance. 
7. Eat healthy. Not OCD related but you’ll feel better. 

It’s going to be ok :)",227,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1etb23t/it_gets_so_much_better/
OCD,No one gets it,I'm trying to do exposures but my ocd thoughts and feelings feel true. I don't want to get into the topic because I feel like nobody gets it. I'm having thoughts and feelings that are presenting themselves where it feels like its genuine and what I'm experiencing. My therapist says treat it as ocd and don't engage. I feel so fed up and like we are going in different directions with therapy. How can I ignore this and label my thoughts and not engage when I feel like its coming up for me like this? I feel like nobody understands me. ,1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1jr68pj/no_one_gets_it/
OCD,Earthquakes and OCD don't mix and I hate that nobody understands this ,"So I live in nj. Yes  the possibility of having earthquakes here is normal  however  at 46 years old I've never actually experienced one. We did have one in my area  it was a 4.8  small I know but it rattled my house  things fell off shelves and it lasted about 30 seconds. I logically understand this was not a big quake in the grand scheme of things. We have also had several smaller ones in the 2.6 range that have followed.

I am NOT doing well with this. AT ALL. my entire existence is built around things being exactly the same and predictable.  You can predict a storm or a blizzard. You can prepare for those. You can not prepare for the ground to randomly shake while you are making coffee.  

My nerves are shot. Anyone I've mentioned it to has literally laughed at me  except my therapist.  Thunder and loud trucks scare me now. And this has served as yet another reminder at how little empathy people have and what an absolute weirdo I am.  I hate that everyone else can just be ok and am so scared I've gone into freeze mode.  Compulsively checking the earthquake map  news articles  wondering what that noise was  is another coming?

OCD,TW - OCD that attacks my passions in life,"Hey everyone  first time posting here. I’m (25m) a natural bodybuilder  and I’ve recently come to the conclusion that I struggle with OCD and I have since I can remember  now that I look back. 

For a little extra background  I’ve been through some really messed up stuff in life. My dad was a huge alcoholic when I was growing up  mom wasn’t around to protect me  I didn’t have friends in school until I got to college. (Luckily  I found bodybuilding in the midst of my father’s alcoholism  which happens to be one of my themes.) My best friend from college was killed by his roommate just before we started our senior year in chemistry together  and I spent a year and a half in court testifying against the roommate as the situation could easily have resulted in my death instead of his. On a normal day  my head is not a nice place to be  between survivor’s guilt  OCD  and the rest of what I’ve been through. Again  this is just to add background and maybe help things make sense. I don’t want sympathy here. 

Anyway  my OCD manifests in some really dumb but also really smart ways. Common themes for me have been religion when I was growing up  relationships now that I’m an adult  college  and my bodybuilding career. 

Regarding all of these things  a lot of the time I’ll make bets in my brain  such as “if this traffic light doesn’t turn green in the next three seconds  I have to stop bodybuilding  or break up with my gf  or it’s a sign that something is wrong ” which I’ve come to understand is magical thinking. Other times  it’s smarter  using actual arguments that I can’t get rid of for hours or days on end. It doesn’t stop. 

When it comes to my bodybuilding  it’s “What if I don’t actually love this? What if I’m doing something wrong? What if I’m not doing this for me? What if I’m only doing this because of how I started? What if continuing with this only keeps me in the cycle of the trauma I went through? What if I’m being selfish by eating as much as I need to gain muscle  while there are people in the world who don’t have enough to eat to live?” The last question is what’s been on repeat for the last couple hours for me. 

When it comes to relationships  I’ve run from every one I’ve gotten into. The uncertainty kills me. I have this underlying feeling of needing to run  and if I’m being honest  it feels a lot like how it did when my father would chase me around the house drunk and nobody was there to protect me. It’s always  “What if we aren’t compatible? What if she wants kids? What if she doesn’t want kids? What if we don’t have enough in common? What if she’s mean? What if I’m not actually attracted to her?” And then I constantly check my emotions when I’m with my partner. Luckily  I have found an amazing partner who is extremely patient with me. 

I guess I came here to ask if anyone else has OCD that makes them feel guilty for pursuing the things that make life worth living for them. Maybe the stress I’m under at the moment is making it worse too considering I’m 34 days out from a men’s physique show that I’ve been prepping for since October  and it’s been my dream to go pro as a natural bodybuilder since I was 16. It’s like the closer I get to achieving my dream  the more my brain pushes back. 

Does anyone relate? Does OCD make you feel guilty for pursuing your dreams? 

I apologize for the long background in advance. ",3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1j7nsgl/tw_ocd_that_attacks_my_passions_in_life/
OCD,I feel like a burden,"Even though my loved ones were to deny it  I still feel that they will be better off without me; I feel like a burden.  
My only motivation now is to get better so that I will stop feeling like a burden to them but it's so hard...  
  
What are the motivations that you guys rely on to get by?  
  
For me it would be:

# “You don’t have to be positive. You don’t have to feel guilty about fear or sadness or anger. You don’t stop the rain by telling it to stop. Sometimes you just have to let it pour  let it soak you to your skin. It never rains forever. And know that  however wet you get  you are not the rain. You are not the bad feelings in your head. You are the person experiencing the storm.”

OCD,I feel like I’m always just preparing for a breaking point.,"My OCD is so bad that I feel like I spend most of the time that I’m not in therapy or working my job (which I ironically really like and would like to keep working for a long time)  just trying to come to terms with the idea that I’ll probably be exposed for being a bad person (even though all the people in my life assure me I am not). My primary obsession is that I made mistakes on taxes in the past and most people have told me it’s all pretty minor and wouldn’t amount to anything too distressing  and that’s IF I was to be audited which is a low chance. I don’t trust anyone and am convinced that something will happen that will ruin my life. 

I have started to treat every day like “well maybe I might as well just take it as easy as possible and do the bare minimum” since my mind has me convinced that I’m probably going to end up in jail for some reason. Or my livelihood will fall apart soon. 

I have stopped spending money on anything I “like” such as clothes  accessories  etc. I ordered some Xmas presents for my daughter so that I have something for her in case my breaking point comes soon. I have no desire to celebrate holidays this year. My relationship with my mother has gone to shit - talking to her about ocd triggers me like crazy. And I don’t have a close relationship with my father or siblings to the extent I would talk to them about it. 

I see my therapist twice a week and have only been formally diagnosed for the last 7 months. My husband is trying to be supportive to best of his ability but I know it’s really frustrating.

I’m currently quarantining due to Covid AND am on my period  so I’m just feeling extra terrible lol. My covid symptoms are basically gone so I’m sad I still have to quarantine and I have all this time to ruminate which sucks. My OCD symptoms in general are even more exacerbated thanks to hormones. I’m having a really good time!!! Anyways  my pure O symptoms in general have been worse the past few months  which is my own fault  due to not doing ERP  giving into compulsions more  etc. My boyfriend keeps telling me to do my exposures and I will for a day or two and then fall off the wagon. I just feel bad for putting him in this position where he has to deal with me randomly sobbing  seeking reassurance  etc. My OCD has latched onto him and our relationship so I tend to have OCD attacks around him due to him being a trigger. I just feel like a burden and feel terrible that I’m doing worse again. Any tips or recommendations on how to stay on top of doing exposures?

OCD,Feeling worthless and relentlessly comparing myself to others,"Recently I’ve been noticing a lot of incredibly negative thought patterns and mental compulsions to compare myself with anyone and everyone  but especially my partner. His successes  his accomplishments  his happiness. I desperately want to just be genuinely happy for him without falling into a depressive spiral. We’ve discussed it some  and I’ve made sure to emphasize that he should not limit himself and I would never want to hold him back. I feel really alone and broken  and I’ve been grappling with this for a few months now. It feels like a type of obsession where I can’t stop thinking in these patterns that make me feel worthless and avoiding things that trigger the most sadness and self hatred.

OCD,OCD and Abandonment issue in relationship - I am obsessed with comparing with partner/date’s exes wanting to prove I am more worthy of love. If their exes cheated and I don’t think they love me more  I feel worthless.,"I have very serious abandonment issue because things happened as a kid and a parent decided to side with the older sibling  offered no help and accused me of lying. I felt utterly betrayed and at the same time doubted my side of the story. I used to be very smart. Then I became a ball of anxiety not being able to function super well at studying. I showed symptoms of OCD since I was 10. (Diagnosed at 25) Self esteem has been non existent since back then.

Every time I get into a relationship (or even just on  a date)  I see my date as someone to prove my worth. Oh if so many people like him he must be a great partner and if he likes me then I am not a piece of shit anymore. I ignore the red flags - maybe he is too sexual or maybe he seems to be not over his ex. Then I proceed to this mandatory comparison with his exes. It’s particularly bad if he doesn’t hate his exes or even speaks fondly of his exes. Then I would feel very inadequate. Deep down I have this monologue going on thinking Oh with time you would know I am so much better. I would hate their exes for ruining a relationship that could have been mine. (Crazy I know) And I would get angry at that ex who cheated but still being spoken fondly of. Like I get offended because I am such a good girlfriend and none of my exes would miss me like that despite I never cheated. Then I proceed to dig out what’s so good about the cheating exes that my dates would stay with them regardless. Thinking I must be lacking those qualities. Then I go down this downward spiral of jealousy and self doubt. Then I get clingy. Thinking if they are not interested then it proves again I am not even good enough despite my having been a very loyal partner to every exes of mine.

I am exhausted. I do not know what to do. I don’t wanna do this. But I cannot stop. I get very attached and show signs of this very serious abandonment issue with anyone I talk to for more than a week and kinda like. 

Am I crazier than I realise? I have been going to different therapists regularly for many years. I am not sure if I will ever get better...",6,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/her4nn/ocd_and_abandonment_issue_in_relationship_i_am/

bipolar,A New Friend... 🤍 (TW: Suicidal Ideation),"All I could think about was suicide until I met her... 🥺
 
(Context) 

A couple months ago  I escaped an abusive household  and moved in with my dad. That's when I started having mood episodes. At first  I was hypomanic  and then after a mixed episode  I became severely depressed. 

At that point  my dad realized he wouldn't be able to support me by himself. So  he sent me to to uncle's house. My grandma was staying there too  but eventually  she had to go back to her home country. When I realized I'd be alone there without anyone to hang out with  I had another depressive episode. 

Eventually  I got admitted into a psychiatric hospital  where nurses and doctors neglected me. My uncle wanted no part in this  so he shut me out  and I had to move back in with my toxic family.

All night  I've been thinking about how suicide is the only way out. That's when my stepdad brought me a lost dog  and until we find her owner  she'll be staying in my room. Having her aroud makes me feel really happy  but I know the feeling won't last forever.",428,18,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ib4kwn

bipolar,Do you ever feel as if suicide is inevitable ?,"*** First  I want to assure you that I am currently not experiencing any thoughts of self-harm and do not have any active plans to harm myself. I have been consistently taking medication for the past 15 years and regularly seeing a therapist every two weeks. Although I am going through a depressive episode  I want to emphasize that I am generally doing okay. ***

However  I have been contemplating a question that has been on my mind: whether suicide is an inevitable outcome for me. I have struggled with suicidal thoughts since my early teens and have come close to acting on them twice in the past. During my undergraduate  I had to take a medical withdrawal for a year  and later in grad school  I was fortunate enough to receive ketamine therapy  which was a costly but potentially life-saving treatment.

The challenging aspect is that these thoughts never completely disappear. Usually  they are passive  and I can dismiss them as irrational. However  when I find myself in a depressive episode (as I do like now)  these thoughts become more persistent and compelling  making a strong case for ending my life. During such times  I rely on coping strategies I have learned in therapy  such as contemplating the impact of my death on loved ones  but it takes considerable effort.

My concern stems from the feeling that at some point  the situation will worsen  and suicide will become an inevitable option. I genuinely don't know how I can endure another 40 to 50 years with bipolar disorder  given the constant presence of these thoughts.

Unfortunately  I feel unable to share these concerns with my psychiatrist or therapist due to worries about their reactions. The financial burden of my current treatment is already significant; who knows what they would do? 

I'm curious to know if others can relate to these feelings. How do you personally cope with them? Or do you simply accept the possibility and continue with your life? I would appreciate a compassionate response  as I am genuinely seeking guidance and understanding.",236,99,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/13jac2h/do_you_ever_feel_as_if_suicide_is_inevitable/

bipolar,Unpopular opinion: Mania isn't better than depression.,"Depression sucks. It really does. Being numb to everything  not being able to leave the bed  not having the energy to shower or do ANYTHING other than rot  and just straight up wanting to die fucking *sucks* and I don't wish that feeling upon anybody.

BUT!

It's not worse than mania. I'd say they're equally bad. 

Unless your manic episodes are usually only mild hypomanic ones and you somehow manage to focus the excess energy on something useful  mania is fucking horrible. It might be fun when it first sets in  but within mere days  mania has the potential to ruin your entire life. Just as an example  here are some of the things I've done while manic:

- I almost completely ruined my relationship by rekindling an old flame (who had already ghosted me 10+ times before) and planning to visit them (I booked flights and a hotel... twice) behind my partner's back because I felt like that was just such a great idea. The only reason my partner didn't break up with me for that is good faith and nothing else. I would have *deserved* to be broken up with.

- I racked up over 2k in debt - which I still struggle to pay off to this day - in just a couple of days when I booked the aforementioned hotels and flights.

- I had a complete stranger drive me  a  at the time non-passing  5'1 110lbs  trans man  all the way from Houston to San Antonio to meet yet another stranger for sex  without telling anyone close to me where I was going and who was taking me there. I am SO lucky I didn't get kidnapped or worse.

These are just a few of my stories  and I know they're not nearly as bad as some other people's. 

Since my bipolar disorder has been in remission for 1 3/4 years  I don't think I want to experience either depression or mania ever again. The only thing worse than either is mixed episodes.

FUCK mixed episodes.",214,104,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1h2ylgi/unpopular_opinion_mania_isnt_better_than/

bipolar,[Help] I feel stuck and overwhelmed by everything,"Hi everyone 

I think I should say this is a throwaway account. I'm bipolar and currently in treatment. Therapy took me out of suicidal thoughts and helped me stabilize when I was adapting to the meds  so now I'm here. The goal of this post is to vent and ask for advice because the way things go idk I feel like I will be miserable forever  even if that makes no logical sense  and I know it makes no sense. I'm feeling really stuck and could use some advice.

I'm a software engineer in Portugal  earning just a bit over minimum wage. My job is draining  and I feel helpless. My wife is unemployed and studying  so quitting isn't an option. I love and I want to support her in her quest too.

Although I've been way worse  and it's been months since I had mania or suicidal thoughts.  I'm exhausted most days  which stops me from moving on  you know  learning things that could actually take me away from this situation. I know I should just sit down for 30 minutes a day to study something else like full-stack development  something all my friends suggested  and idk 30 more minutes to apply for jobs on linkedin  but I feel anxious and disgusted whenever I open my PC at home. I can't bring myself to study or code outside work for even five minutes without feeling paralyzed.

Honestly  I don't think I'm a good dev. The framework I work with is really niche  and I never had formal education in the field. I tried going to college for computer science before I had the diagnosis  and I quit after a depressive episode and plummeting in every subject. Then I went to biology  something I still enjoy  and then COVID came and I had to get a job so I quit that too.

Also  applying for jobs on LinkedIn is the most depressing thing ever. Everyone has impossible standards and posts toxic fake nonsense generated by GPT with the same ""higienyzed"" marketing voice. When I finally get to an interview  nobody has barely even read my CV  and they all ask questions like ""do you know absolutely everything?"" because they have very little idea of what we actually do as devs. Then  I get to a technical challenge that I feel absolutely crushed by because I haven't been studying over the past months to be able to do them.

I've considered other paths. I write okay despite this rant  but never had the courage to write a book  and the effort scares me. I've started and gave up on several blogs about different topics. I've been a cashier  a biology lab tech  and a clerk in a healthcare unit (which was okay)  but I was miserable in all of them.

Most of the time  I feel like I don't fit anywhere  that the way other people live is just soulcrushing and slowly gets to me. I've been in this job for over one year now  longer than any other I've been  and I already want to quit. Sometimes I think I should go back to my family to rest and build myself up again  but that feels like failure  and it is an irrational illusion anyway. I left my parents for many reasons – we were never happy together  my country is violent and full of inequalities  and I'd rather not go back to that.

Has anyone been in a similar situation of just not fitting? Of feeling the need to better yourself  but now managing to? How did you find a way out? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

\--

TLDR: I feel stuck  lost and paralyzed by the need to learn something new to get out of where I am. I feel that I do not fit anywhere I look  and all my options feel overwhelming. I would appreciate any advice.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1iwar4c/help_i_feel_stuck_and_overwhelmed_by_everything/

bipolar,anyone bipolar that has been addicted to w33d? i need some help,I’ve been diagnosed with depression  anxiety and psychosis for over a year now and i’ve been on 4 different antidepressants and none of them seemed to work. after experiencing my first intense manic episode my therapist told me it sounded like BP. i don’t want to self diagnose but my brother is bipolar and me having it makes sense. I got a  psychological eval with 3 doctors and several test packets but my mom won’t show me the results and her excuse is she never got them (she doesn’t want to admit that i could be BP like my brother) which is bs because i took the tests over multiple days in the mental hospital. anyways  i was doing better over the summer but after a fall out in october with my friend group  best friends  and ex bf I attempted and was admitted to the mental hospital for my 3rd time that year. when i returned home i didn’t feel any better and turned to weed. i smoked daily ALOT from october to february. I smoked carts and dry daily going through a gram cart in 2-3 days not including dry and eddies. keep in mind i’m only 100 lbs. in the beginning of january i was out of money and had to be sober for two days. the withdrawals were terrible i couldn’t eat  sleep or do anything but throw up and lay down in an even more depressive state. after that i realized i was addicted. i know weed is easier to quit for some people but I used it to self medicate and relied on it due to my depression (and possibly BP??)with out it even before i wasn’t sleeping without sleeping meds or eating unless i force fed myself. in february I decided to take a tolerance break for 5 days. same thing happened with withdrawals except this time i didn’t only have the physical symptoms but i had entered a manic episode. i didn’t sleep for multiple days and stayed up doing old homework assignments  making films and doing random shi i wouldn’t usually do. after the five days was up i went back to smoking as much as i was before. a month ago my brother was checking into rehab (same one with BP). i told myself by the time he got home I would be sober too. a week ago i started weening slowly and made my cart last a week and only smoked one 6lunt. sunday was my first day sober and i woke up monday and puked (which i totally expected) the rest of the day i was busy which helped distract me from the withdrawals. today is my fourth day sober and i’m feeling incredibly good. yes this seems like a great thing to hear but this is usually how my manic episodes begin. i feel like so good that i couldn’t imagine ever being as depressed as i once was. the only thing that is different is i haven’t been having impulses  i’ve been able to sleep and my energy doesn’t seem manic at all. i’m genuinely confused because i usually can’t tell when i’m manic at first until i do smtg that’s obviously impulsive or dumb. idk if it’s me feeling so good from being sober or what but it just seems too good to be true if you know what i mean. i mean i still haven’t been able to eat much and i’ve been having raging head and body aches and i’ve been dissociating a lot more in the past 4 days. basically i made this post to see if there are any other people out there that have suffered from a w33d addiction and are bipolar. and if so did u ever get manic when going through withdrawals? i just need some help i feel so lost,6,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/mcpa8x/anyone_bipolar_that_has_been_addicted_to_w33d_i/

bipolar,Bipolar artist  addict  wanna share my story  maybe it will help somebody(long post),"My story is very long so I’ll divide it by parts for easier reading.

1. Intro
Hello so I am 20yo male  bipolar  I’ve been seeing psychiatrist for about 2 years now.
I have several(like 10) suicide attempts on my record first one was when I was 8  tried to line my wrists. Two of these suicide attempts were nearly successfull. I am a child of broken home and I have a very bad relationships with my parents. I was beaten when I was a child and this is probably why my mental state got fucked up.  
I am ashamed of this and I had to go a long road before actually facing the fact that I am mentally ill. I used to stop taking my medications because I thought that I shouldn’t take them because I didn’t want to accept the fact that I am ill. Used to think that I am a normal person  I was lying to myself so much that I believed in it. 

2. Becoming an artist
I didn’t really have much friends and I actually found it easier for me to talk with girls instead of boys. They seemed closer to me on emotional level so I got labeled as “crybaby” and was bullied a lot. From bullying I learned how much hate there is in human. Therefore I got anxiety and insecurity. But I always was passionate about music. Discovered Linkin Park as a kid  then got into Nirvana and Green Day. I went fully into Kurt Cobain’s biography and I got a strong connection with his music and his personality. So I bought a guitar at the age of 12 with the money I got from selling almost all my clothes. I didn’t have anything else to do so I just played for days  after two weeks of self-learning from YouTube videos I managed to become pretty good at playing and I started to learn Nirvana songs  years passed and I got into a couple of bands but it didn’t really work out for me. It was 2016 and I got into Lil Peep. I still tried to accomplish something with grunge/punk rock  but nothing worked out. After Lil Peeps death I went all in into his kind of music and it worked. I am not a very popular artist but I got some fans. 


3. Drug part

I don’t propose drug use. Drugs are a slippery road and you must think twice before trying them.

I have tried marijuana when I was 16  first it wasn’t big of a deal  because I did it occasionally with some phony friends. After some time I started to smoke alone and at some point it helped me relax and get away from all this bs. At the age of 18 I didn’t have friends at all. So I spent my time alone  got into stimulants and oh boy it all went wrong after this  I got really hooked on Molly and Amphetamine. Spent all my money on it  simply because they made me more opened and confident. Marathoned a lot. I didn’t really care about myself so I just rolled and rolled until I got placed into asylum after another suicide attempt. Tried to run away a few times  didn’t work. Went through a rehab and then got off stimulants. Was prescribed Xanax for anxiety and a bunch of other meds and of fucking course I abused it. Used to skip the days. Felt like heaven cuz I didn’t have to do anything but sleep and it helped me get away from my thoughts. After some time I met a guy  who’s now my one and only best friend and at that point I felt ashamed of being an addict and with the help of my psychiatrist and my friend dropped Xan  but after some time she prescribed me Ritalin  I tricked her into it and I feel very bad about it. Aaaaand I  abused it. On daily bases. I was prescribed one pack a month  it included 30 pills 10mg. Of course I ran out of those quickly so I struggled with cravings  and I felt very depressed and suicidal. I didn’t tell this to my bestfriend because I was afraid he was going to dump me. After like three months of this I told him and my psychiatrist about it. My doc wasn’t very happy about it but she still helped me. Right now I am taking all my meds as I am prescribed to. 
After I tried LSD and damn  this shit changed my whole mindset. I got like reset or something and I understood many things and realised a lot about myself and made a big progress after.


4. My advice 

So to all of you who really struggle to find your place in this world I’ll tell you this: Never let people tell you who you should be. Always stay true to yourself and remember that you matter. Always. You can do it. Even if it seems hopeless keep on trying it will get better eventually  it won’t happen instantly and you might not notice it but every time you face yourself and problems you become a better version of yourself. Start with simple things like waking up at the right time or simply brushing your teeth. Make yourself do it  even if you fail it’s okay  life goes on and you got the time. It’s never too late. Nobody is perfect so start with yourself and believe in yourself even if everybody around tells you that you are shit. Live life the way you want  not the way anybody else wants  be what you wanna be. 

5. Ending  my life now.

Right now I take my meds the way I am prescribed. Working on a new album and I am clean from all drugs I used to do for 6 months. I love myself. And I am actually enjoying my life. 

Love you  stay strong. Thank you for reading",9,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/i5n6u0/bipolar_artist_addict_wanna_share_my_story_maybe/
bipolar,Bipolar and loneliness,I’m making this post out of sadness and just because I’m coming from a low place. Having this disorder has shaped my life for many years and I’ve come to realize that I don’t have a lot of people in my life who I can relate to in terms of how taxing bipolar disorder is. I’m in a spot where my medication isn’t working the way it should  I’m rapid cycling which is absolutely horrible. Everything I feel is out of control and not appropriate. I’m being monitored closely but am seriously at such a point of loneliness. I’m in university and struggling with everything.

bipolar,My loneliness is killing me  & I  I must confess  it’s because of me.,"I feel so alone right now  even though I know I’m the one causing it. I had a major setback in my career last week (something that’s been building for weeks)  and I completely lost it. Since then  I’ve been spiraling  and my poor husband has reached his limit. We’ve barely been talking  and when he does try to talk to me  I snap at him.

I want love and support  but for some reason  I can’t seem to accept it from anyone. I’ve shut my parents out completely. My sister has reached out several times in the past few days  and I haven’t responded  I feel emotionally disconnected. I’ve fallen into a deep depression  isolating myself from everyone even though I know that’s only making things worse.

On top of that  I’ve taken out my pain on my husband for simply living his normal life. Why do I do this? Am I jealous that he seems okay while I feel like everything is falling apart? That’s not a good reason to lash out  but the words just spill out of me before I can stop them. I say things I don’t mean  things that hurt  and I hate myself for it.

I don’t feel like I deserve anyone checking in on me  but at the same time  I know I can’t pull myself out of this alone.

P.S. I hope you can appreciate my lighthearted title for this post. A touch of humor is all I have right now.",14,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1ig3rhl/my_loneliness_is_killing_me_i_i_must_confess_its/

bipolar,A New Friend... 🤍 (TW: Suicidal Ideation),"All I could think about was suicide until I met her... 🥺
 
(Context) 

A couple months ago  I escaped an abusive household  and moved in with my dad. That's when I started having mood episodes. At first  I was hypomanic  and then after a mixed episode  I became severely depressed. 

At that point  my dad realized he wouldn't be able to support me by himself. So  he sent me to to uncle's house. My grandma was staying there too  but eventually  she had to go back to her home country. When I realized I'd be alone there without anyone to hang out with  I had another depressive episode. 

Eventually  I got admitted into a psychiatric hospital  where nurses and doctors neglected me. My uncle wanted no part in this  so he shut me out  and I had to move back in with my toxic family.

All night  I've been thinking about how suicide is the only way out. That's when my stepdad brought me a lost dog  and until we find her owner  she'll be staying in my room. Having her aroud makes me feel really happy  but I know the feeling won't last forever.",426,18,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ib4kwn

bipolar,Do you ever feel as if suicide is inevitable ?,"*** First  I want to assure you that I am currently not experiencing any thoughts of self-harm and do not have any active plans to harm myself. I have been consistently taking medication for the past 15 years and regularly seeing a therapist every two weeks. Although I am going through a depressive episode  I want to emphasize that I am generally doing okay. ***

However  I have been contemplating a question that has been on my mind: whether suicide is an inevitable outcome for me. I have struggled with suicidal thoughts since my early teens and have come close to acting on them twice in the past. During my undergraduate  I had to take a medical withdrawal for a year  and later in grad school  I was fortunate enough to receive ketamine therapy  which was a costly but potentially life-saving treatment.

The challenging aspect is that these thoughts never completely disappear. Usually  they are passive  and I can dismiss them as irrational. However  when I find myself in a depressive episode (as I do like now)  these thoughts become more persistent and compelling  making a strong case for ending my life. During such times  I rely on coping strategies I have learned in therapy  such as contemplating the impact of my death on loved ones  but it takes considerable effort.

My concern stems from the feeling that at some point  the situation will worsen  and suicide will become an inevitable option. I genuinely don't know how I can endure another 40 to 50 years with bipolar disorder  given the constant presence of these thoughts.

Unfortunately  I feel unable to share these concerns with my psychiatrist or therapist due to worries about their reactions. The financial burden of my current treatment is already significant; who knows what they would do? 

I'm curious to know if others can relate to these feelings. How do you personally cope with them? Or do you simply accept the possibility and continue with your life? I would appreciate a compassionate response  as I am genuinely seeking guidance and understanding.",237,99,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/13jac2h/do_you_ever_feel_as_if_suicide_is_inevitable/

This is not the only reason i want to move  I honestly hate living here in America and want to experience something completely new  it would be like a movie. fuck the drugs  it would just be so awesome to make complete new friends and it would also be awesome to exchange stories with people in London  and have them do the same.

Normally my husband hides my medicine bottles from me because they’re a huge trigger for me because I expressed that that’s how I would kill myself (via ODing on my meds) but when I was refilling my little weekly organizers ([these things which you should check out they’re amazing](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/jrvxm4/if_you_need_a_way_to_org_your_meds_i_highly/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)) (that’s the one time of the week I see all my bottles of meds) I actually haven’t been thinking about suicide when I saw the bottles the last few weeks. 

Well this week I was wondering how I’d feel about it since I feel depressed and I still didn’t feel ANY suicidal thoughts at all! 

And even now when I’m writing about it and I’m thinking about death I’m not thinking I’d rather be dead. !!

This is a huge win for me. I’m 29 and I’ve been very very very suicidal for my entire life  it’s new to me to not be suicidal  period  let alone not be suicidal during a depression.

bipolar,Bipolar is a disability. Yes  for some of us  it's ACTUALLY disabling.,"Made a joke in another sub about how being bipolar is a financial money pit (feel free to check my post history to see) and a bunch of people responded along the lines of ""well I'm bipolar and I graduated top of my class and make six figures now"" ""my wife has bipolar and she's supper successful"" with super pedantic device like ""stick to your treatment and you can be better too!"" and ""support systems are key!"" I'm so upset I had to mute the thread.

Like  I'm not an idiot. I'm perfectly aware there are plenty of successful bipolar people from celebrities to doctors and all the way down. People who are stable and successful. But they're in the minority.

We're all TRYING to be stable -- but that's as stable as we can be as individuals  not as stable as a ""normal"" person. For some of us  bipolar is a permanent  disabling condition. Something that will never be fully managed to stability. Many of us will never have a job  a successful relationship  etc . even if we keep trying meds and therapy. I'm pretty damn emotionally stable on my meds  thank god  but that doesn't mean many of the symptoms that make my life untenable are just gone. 

We're all TRYING to be stable -- but that's as stable as we can be as individuals  not as stable as a ""normal"" person or as stable as each other. For some of us  bipolar is a permanent  disabling condition -- and the law defines it that way  too. Something that will never be fully managed to stability. Many of us will never have a job  a successful relationship  etc . even if we keep trying meds and therapy.

If you're stable  financially successful  and happy while managing bipolar  that's awesome! Good for you! But don't act like the fact that you  personally  can manage your bipolar means that everyone else can follow your ten-step solution to that outcome. And don't cite your support systems in trying to give us advice: Many of us don't have those. If you're even saying ""my wife has bipolar..."" your wife already has more going for her than a lot of us just by virtue of having a spouse who isn't ashamed of them. Many of us can't afford therapy or meds.

Like  I'm going blind  right? I have a degenerative eye disease. But millions and millions of people wear glasses.  I still have vision  so I would never tell a profoundly blind person that they could just see like me if they did the same interventions I've done for my own eyes. In the same way  a person with a super low prescription and no eye diseases should never tell me that.

Disabilities exist on a spectrum. There are wheelchair users who can still walk part-time and there are quadriplegics. There are people who are hard of hearing and there are people who are profoundly Deaf. There are people with mild social anxiety and there are people with anxiety so severe they can't leave their house. There are bipolar people who are healthy and happy and stable -- and there are bipolar people who will never be. Those of us on the far end of that disabled spectrum -- who cannot work  who truly struggle to literally function -- shouldn't be treated like we're a failure because we haven't figured out how to be like the other side.

I'm relatively responsible with money  I talk to my parents again  and I was even able to handle a break up without falling off either end of the deep end. I still swing up and down but the fluctuations are nowhere near what they used to be  and the time between massive depressions feels like it gets longer every time. But when I go down I go down hard. Yesterday I slept for 14 hours and today I haven't slept  and I've had my inner voice constantly telling me I'm nothing and no one  I'm all alone  I'm pathetic  I'm poor  I'm useless  all the usual. 90% of the time I'm totally fine  but when it gets like this it just reminds me of what's wrong with me and that it doesn't go away.

bipolar,Overmedicated? I can't really tell what's going on with me,"So I have been diagnosed with bipolar 2 for awhile now and have been on wellbutrin since january and  lamictal since may. I have been feeling a lot more stable which is so nice since my life is full of stress (I am a collegiate student athlete) so I have been able to manage that a lot better than in the past. Before I would make myself freak out about things just to get motivation to actually do them versus now I can somewhat plan when I need to do an assignment etc without having to work myself up. I do feel this nagging anxiety deep inside of me though and I don't know why. Maybe because I feel like I'm always forgetting something? I tend to have more of a ""spaced out"" personality but I am a very ""on top of it"" person. I get good grades  play a division 1 sport  and have a pretty solid social life but I also just feel like I'm just barely existing. 

Lately  I haven't really been feeling emotions. I don't think I'm in a depressive episode because I still do what I have to do - I just feel like there's something missing. Maybe it's because my days are so structured? This has been going on for the past 3 months and now I barely have any motivation to take care of myself. I unintentionally eat 1 meal a day but I still workout and study which is so confusing to me. The thought of making a meal for myself seems very exhausting. I have always been very high achieving and have worked with my therapist to get to a level of self care that made me feel good  but now I'm just regressing and I can't seem to care at all. It could be that I'm just used to the highs and lows  but since starting medication they have dwindled down before I started feeling this way. At my last session  my therapist mentioned that I could be over medicated but I don't think that's the case since I am functioning well. I just seem to not get the full enjoyment out of things  I know that doing certain things are fun and make me feel good but right now I'm just kind of recognizing that and not really feeling the ""fun"" and feel good emotions. I have a really bad spending problem too - which my therapist also thinks that I'm just chasing dopamine - which could also be a big possibility.

I can't seem to care for anything  I have things I know I care about like school  friends  sports but everything else is very bland. I am very indifferent to things  I don't care about most of the decisions I make and it's just creeping me out that I just stopped caring. I feel kind of disconnected and am always ""in my own world"" but I just don't feel alive anymore. I don't feel sad at all or like there's this pull of a deeper sadness - I just am very confused and ""meh"".

bipolar,What are your more amusing  mostly harmless consequences of this bipolar ride?,"I don't know about you  but I've been focusing so much on the negatives of this disorder recently. Sometimes though  the ride makes me   and those around me  genuinely laugh. Here's my recent silly story. 

I made an error with Xmas lights. Our old lights are too short for our tree   so apparently  during a hypo episode  I bought longer ones in the summer (amongst a whole hypo-heap of other purchases). Much   much longer tree lights.They go around the tree and windows twice. I no longer need the main room lights on 🤣

Also  I can't find our old lights...

Obviously  shouldn't be a regular thing (especially while on medication)  but where's the balance on life and experiences?

Work is planning on sending me to an off-site in Dublin with my team. There's going to be drinking. I would like to participate  but recognize that comes with a cost in stability. Is this just an experience I accept I don't get to have in my life  ever?

Further  we shouldn't stop taking medication but we also shouldn't mix medication and alcohol. Drinking is now doing two bad things - stop taking medication (bad) and drinking (bad)  or mixing medication and alcohol (bad) and drinking (bad).

Im diagnosed with bipolar 2. i had a severe episode in august but since then  ive been put on new meds that are working. so im not concerned about that. 

i know they can’t legally tell me i cant be an EMT  but can they use that as a reason to not let me take the class?

Part of me wants to lie but i know that will probably back fire but i really want to take this class. is there any chance they can stop me from being an emt because of my bipolar?

edit: the class goes on until april  so i’m not going to become an EMT anytime soon. i’m aware it’s a stressful job  my current job is also stressful. i know it’s not the same but i work in a kitchen so im used to the long shifts/odd hours.

bipolar,Life is meaningless on Lamictal,"Heres a bit of a rant. My main question is below in bold though if you want to skip all the emotional ranting..

I take lamictal for bipolar 2 and adderall for ADHD. Ever since the Lamictal I am calmer  but it's compromised any joy  interest  or motivation i once had. When I was off meds  when my mania would hit i would try to start all sorts of projects and get easily excited. I could easily entertain myself. 

Now  nothing has meaning. People bore me  I don't care to converse with them  I just don't care.  I will stop taking my lamictal for a day and I will feel so allive  i just love that feeling.. like llife is good  music  the weather  people and just everything. Then of course I always end up crashing. 

Playing around with your lamictal dose will send you to HELL. I remember the only times i felt good when I was on ssri's was when I would stop taking it for a bit  but i never felt the horrible effects that I did with lamictal.

I am supposedly bipolar 2. I was abusing alcohol and adderall a lot  so I am not sure if that lifestyle just caused me to be like that. I also got manic on ssri's. Many medications make me manic.

It’s like everything I do there is challenges with and it’s hard to explain to my surroundings. Yes I’m depressed again   no i don’t know why. Yes I know I was super happy or angry a week ago  no I don’t know why. It’s so annoying that just because there is some chemicals in my brain not working probably I can get so ill that I can’t leave my bed or so manic that I can manage to completely screw up my life in so little time. Like I know I have certain triggers and I am medicated but you can never be too sure. 

It’s insane how my brain can go from:” life is meaningless  no one loves me” to:” lmao would it be funny if we cheated on our boyfriend with his brother and afterwards quit our job to go to India and become a Hindu” NO! IT WOULD NOT BE FUNNY! 

I also have generalised anxiety and sometimes it’s like my bipolar manage to multiply my anxiety by 1000. Like yes I’m going to the dentist or on public transportation  yes I have been there like a million times before  have I ever had a bad experience there? no  then why am I anxious? Lol no clue.

bipolar,How much of this is self created?,"Hi everyone  I’m 23f and recently diagnosed as bipolar 1.

I’ve been going through the motions - denial  acceptance  anxiety  confusion  etc.

But I’ve also been reflecting on my life  and one thing that stands out to me is the fact that there’s been a certain pattern to my mental reality and personal choices. And that pattern *could* be named bipolar  but it could equally be seen as a series of unfortunate choices strongly influenced by my long standing ways of thinking and deeply held attitudes. None of which are great. I’m taking full responsibility and admitting that I’m a pretty pessimistic person with some genuinely terrible patterns of being. Nothing criminal  but I am disgustingly cruel towards myself and have been for years  and I believe I’ve probably been more self destructive than the average person. And why? Maybe mania  sure. Maybe it’s the “illness”. Or maybe  it’s a chosen lack of awareness and slipping into comfortable patterns. Lack of effort. Fear or discomfort with choosing different. So I’m choosing to do an experiment. For the next 2 weeks  I am going to try to constantly choose different. To not be myself   but a version of me pretending to have healthy patterns every chance I get. 

For the last 2 weeks  I’ve been “severely depressed” and for the next 2 I am going to pretend that the depression was fake and that I’m really not that. Maybe some would say that means I’m not truly depressed  but I ask of you to consider that there’s something to this. A part of the “illness” is a series of choices. 

Biology is not meaningless  psychiatry not nothing. But I really think there’s something here  and I’m looking forward to this mini experiment I’m going to do with myself. Forcing different choices  pretending I am someone with healthy self talk and healthy behaviours and healthy relationships. Then checking if I’m still fitting the criteria for depression.

bipolar,What’s symptoms and what’s me?,"
Blah blah blah gifted but brittle child. Parents didn’t get it. Wept about failure which was less than 100%  and then avoided it. Intense and driven and ambitious in a singularly focussed way  which meant I was weird and off-putting. obsessed about anything I liked  became expert  emailed academics  wrote essays and analyses  learnt things and taught myself difficult complex ways to think about the world. autodidact in the extreme I suppose. 

diagnosed at 20. meds sort of numbed this or muffled it. no more leaps of genius  except recently have been making leaps again. it’s been noticed at work. bonuses  which is rare in my line of work  and comments about how brilliant i am and the great things for which i am destined. I am not making this up lol. but I’m also aware that a job in three years is meaningless now.. two in the hand and all that. Fine words… butter no parsnips. 

i always used to think this: I am genuinely very clever. I write  well  and better every time (mostly fiction  strange stuff and getting stranger… off putting to some because it’s at times densely allusive or referential. I delight in puns  in english and other languages  and find them easier to think of now.  It’s not even thinking it’s just … plucking them from the air). and i am funny  and i know how that sounds but im funny because (so i am told) I care little for derivative things and instead spend my entire life thinking outside the box. I’m also tall  attractive  and have a decent amount of money. so far so good. Things have not always been this easy  mind  because i am also covered with self harm scars and desperately trying to avoid thinking about the person who did that  who is me but can’t be me because how could I hate myself like that?

so like my point i guess is that: i am brilliant  ambitious  i don’t need much sleep ever (we talked at work about superpowers and i said id never sleep because then id have so much more time for all of the things i find interesting  which is almost everything ever to have happened in the world  and i want to learn about it all but even with 4-5 hours of sleep a night theres not enough time… feels like a weird curse sometimes. I will do my best!)..

bipolar,“The Thread” - physical art + some writing,"TRIGGER WARNING: Suicidcal ideation

Here’s a piece I made last month inspired by some writing I did in November. The writing is inspired by my first major depressive episode a bit over ten years ago.

THE THREAD -



Lying there in the literal depths of despair  deep down within the inescapable abyss  all hope has been lost. It has simply ceased to exist in any manner. Every last fiber of human connection has been severed and there is not even a singular photon of light within the tunnel-which-has-no-end. I am truly alone  and nobody is going to save me. There will be no tomorrow.

To my surprise  I find a singular thread of hope. It’s as if someone or something has materialized this gift for me within this vast and all-consuming wasteland of solitude and emptiness. I was not searching for this. I don’t know what this thread is or what it represents  it’s entirely meaningless to me. However  it is in fact all I have left. Nothing else  only myself and this light blue thread. I don’t understand why nor how  but I know I was meant to have this and it is a gift from a world unknown. 

I decide to take control of my destiny  at least for tonight  until tomorrow’s trials bear their full weight upon my entire existence once more and crush every last bit of me and the cycle begins again. 

Or maybe tomorrow will be different. 

The clouds start to pass. The rain emanating from my mind and forming rivers down my face has subsided for the moment. The moon reveals itself from the clouds and shines a silver beam of life down upon me. The shackles upon my soul have loosened ever so slightly.

I manage to regain the smallest perceivable amount of control over my mind. It feels like attempting to wrangle a bull with nothing but yarn. The untamable beast still roams free  but at least I can pretend my yarn has an effect. 

I’m getting tired. I think I will manage to get a few hours of sleep tonight  won’t have to nap so much at school tomorrow.

Oh how I miss you  crave you. The sweet  sweet bliss of leaving this plane of reality  at least for a short time. Yet  you slip through my fingers so frequently. But tonight  slumber  we are able to meet again. 

Thank you for the gift  unknown bestower of thread. I only hope that one day I can uncover what you really are. ‘Til then. Goodnight.",11,4,https://i.redd.it/0werr00ouzke1.jpeg

bipolar,Bruh I just had seroquel,"And I slept for an entire night. That hasn't happened in several years.

It also felt nice. I relaxed for the first time in a long while. I was more present. But also very sleepy. But now that I've slept  I'm more focused throughout today. 

That is all. I'm excited to keep taking it.


Edit: I had a second dose for last night  too. I'm on 100 mg  and it works great. Same thing as last night. I got 8 hours of sleep and woke up once. I was able to fall back asleep immediately when I wanted to.


Edit 2: I work nights. Today  I suddenly had the hardest time staying awake! Hopefully  that goes away a bit. I also switched some night meds to mornings and added this one. So there's all sorts of things at play  most likely. I still think that the sleep was worth it. :b


Edit 3: Same dose again. I had to get up halfway through my sleep cycle to run an errand. I wasn't nearly as tired upon waking this time  but I was pretty irritable. My mood journal has also leveled out quite a bit already. In general  I feel more relaxed. 
I made a few changes this week. Mild drowsiness  lapses in concentration  mild irritability  and anxiety have happened this week. I was given permission to call if things became urgent  but all of those things were either typical or manageable for me. Upgrades.

Edit 4: and to fall back asleep  I took 150 mg total after edit 3. I got another 10 hours. I think the 2x50 mg is the right dose for right this second  lol.


Edit 5: The appetite change hit. It's not like a constant hunger (though it's more frequent   i.e.  at regular times)  but the big thing is... I don't feel full. I can get to the point where I'm not hungry  but it's hard to stop because I don't feel full. I'm fine with it for now  but I do have to be cognizant  I suppose (and eat out less).


04/10/23: Weight gain is the only side effect now  everything else in life is much better. 200 mg a day made no change  but 300 mg was killer. I didn't even notice it happen  lol. It took about 3 weeks. So I am suddenly about 16 lbs heavier  but I've been known to react that way to other medications. Also  I ignored the ""no night eating"" rule (lol). Even still  this is my favorite med combo to date. I have pleasant and normal sleep  and I feel awake during the day. If I have nothing to do  I sleep for too long  but that is OK by me. (Just get out of bed asap. Sometimes  I fall asleep or back to sleep in like 10 seconds.)

Honestly  if you are recommended this medication  I'd consider it. I tried several that didn't work nearly as well. My new ""normal"" is better  and my definition of ""upset breakdown"" is pretty manageable (and I'd say pretty reasonable). I was a chronic insomniac. I also halted a manic episode/prevented it much better due to this med. Also  I don't struggle with paranoia pretty much at all  and it's pretty easy to spot it and not buy into it. I feel pretty normal! And I'm changing my life up for the better  I think. Yeah :)",301,241,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1182hr2/bruh_i_just_had_seroquel/

bipolar,I'm tired of this life; everything is just a distraction until we die,"Sorry in advance for the long post. I'm tired of relying on medications to keep me functional. They only delay the inevitable. I'm tired of going through the daily motions of life: wake up  get ready for work  work for the majority of my day  leave work  sit in traffic  exercise  eat  shower  watch an hour or so of TV  sleep  restart. Weekends are better but only temporarily relieve me. They're mostly for errands  house chores  some exercise  and prepping for the upcoming work week. 

I'm blessed with so many things: a loving boyfriend of almost 13 years who has ridden the bipolar storms with me and kept me grounded; a loving mother who I want so badly to give grandchildren to  but I'm still not ready  and she's only getting older; a house; no debts; a decent job. And yet  I look forward to nothing. 


I've been back on meds this past month after taking 6 months off as an experiment (Which was successful until work/ career became very stressful)  and I still haven't returned to that functional state prior to the 6 month hiatus. What's taking so long? Has my depression become immune to the medication  now that I had finally gotten to live my life for 6 months without it? Before that  I was more or less stable for 8 years on my current combination of meds  but now it doesn't seem to work. I can't undo my perspective on life (which isn't a new perspective) now that I've seen it as an adult. (The last time I wasn't taking meds  I was only 17) I just don't see an end to this daily cycle and life feels too long. 

However  I should note that my dad took his own life last year  so that might be why I can't seem to shake this latest depression off of me. Although it's ironic- the reason why i decided to go off the meds is because I thought that I could handle anything now that I've dealt with losing my dad to suicide. I thought  what could be worse? And it's true  there's nothing worse than losing a loved one. Especially to suicide. And nothing else really matters. The stress at work  the money you make  and even the vacations you take- none of that really matters because everything is temporary. All the good and bad things are temporary so what's the point of waiting for them to happen?

Everything that happens in life is just a distraction ; we're basically just killing time until we die. For most/ normal people  the uncertainty of life keeps them going. But for me  it doesn't seem worth the effort of living. I'm not suicidal but I sure wish I could hibernate and start all over with a new slate. 

Does anyone view life this way? How do you keep pushing forward in life  knowing that you have to rely on meds everyday and feeling like life is more of a hassle than a beautiful journey?

bipolar,Is there anyone here 35 or over?,"I know there are a lot of people in their 20s here. Probably because that's typically when the worst of the symptoms start to show up. I am 35 and I'm wondering if there are any people my age or older here? Maybe they can relate?

About 8 years ago I got ""stable"" on medication and have pretty much been handling myself since then. I haven't had any real mood episodes.

But I feel like I live in a state of chronic mental pain and anguish and I feel like it's been that way as long as I can remember and I'm just fucking tired of it. I remember being a neurotic little kid  a neurotic teenager  a neurotic 20-something  all the way up to today. And now  even when I have my life on the rails  the mental pain is just so real.

I would love to have just one week a year where I can have the mental peace a normal person has. My husband comes home every day and just chills. When he's worried or upset it looks like something he can handle without such extreme suffering. He sees the same reality day in and day out and doesn't have to ""manage"" in order to maintain his emotional stability. He has so much more energy to spend on things that he loves. He's just so free. Most people seem to be that way compared to me.

I want \*that\*. And the longer I live the more I realize how unfair it is that I've been cursed with \*this\*. I'm not suicidal...I'm just exhausted. It's like going through life constantly having to juggle everywhere you go. Constantly managing. Constantly worried you're going to slip up. And then those long periods where you're sure you're going to lose it and worried you’ll have to lose everything to finally go inpatient again and back on the medication carousel. And then you barely make it to the other side and realize that \*no one\* in your life knew how bad it really was.

And then those days where the inside of your head is an absolute hell and you can't tell anyone because no one ""gets it"".

**I'm 100% sure that this is as good as it gets for me.** I can work  enjoy my time off  and have a good relationship. My bipolar will not get better than this. I was born this way and I will never have a normal brain. I'm just going to have to live in a state of background suffering for what? 50 more years. And be on medication that whole time. It's so fucking bleak. What did I do to deserve this?",205,183,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/us99ch/is_there_anyone_here_35_or_over/
bipolar,There has been another mass shooting  and politicians blame the mentally ill.,"There is literally no evidence that the shooter in Texas had a mental illness.  Republican politicians have blamed mental illness because they don't want to do gun control.  Democratic politicians don't argue  and pretend this guy had a mental illness too.

I have a mental illness  bipolar  and I'm proud to say that people with a mental illness are less likely to commit violence than the average person.

I'm pretty goddamn tired of seeing politicians of both parties blame mentally ill people for a shooting  even if the person who did the shooting was never diagnosed with a mental illness.  This shit needs to stop.

If politicians cared about actual facts  there's a negative correlation between mental illness and violence.  Anyone who knows what they're talking about would agree with that.  It's the politicians who want to do nothing  and want to blame the last marginalized community (mentally ill people) who it's acceptable to blame.

I'll never forget when my fiancee's friend told her family that I had bipolar.  Her parents immediately drove 1 100 miles with no sleep to take my fiancee back to their house.  I politely greeted them and waited for my fiancee to return to our apartment.  She politely asked them to leave  they said they couldn't afford a hotel room  so she politely asked those idiots to go ahead and drive 1 100 miles back.

Of course that same girl later broke up with me for reasons related to her and my mental illness  but fuck.  The amount of prejudice we face.  Literally we are stereotyped as being murderers.  Most of my friends are black and they get stereotyped for everything  but not as murderers.  We're the last people that it's okay to just shit on  to any extent.  I'm upset about it.",192,96,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/13bg6pe/there_has_been_another_mass_shooting_and/
bipolar,When do you know your manic episode is over?,Hello  I ended up in a manic episode a week and half ago. My therapist confirmed it after he heard of my active symptoms of the time. I'm medicated for my Bipolar  so my manic symptoms were less severe. How do you know when your manic episode is over? I originally thought it ended when I stayed up for multiple days and then one day I was super tired and slept all day. However I still feel like I can't slow down and everything is moving too fast. I have too much energy and I feel like I have to keep doing stuff and wanting to socialize constantly.

bipolar,Nobody cares about my birthday and I don’t either,My 22nd birthday is coming up in a few days and it doesn’t feel special. It just kinda feels like another day. I lost all my friends last year because I grew out of partying  so I didn’t really plan on doing anything. Life in general hasn’t been the best either. My depression has gotten incredibly bad  my meds aren’t working as well as they used to and I’m terrified of going through the trials and errors of finding a new one  and I dealt with a heartbreaking event recently that is eating at me. I’m not looking forward to my birthday  a part of me is even dreading it. The only one who’s excited is my sister  which I appreciate very much. Maybe this is selfish to say  but I hoped my family would get together at the very least. We do every year  we go to a dinner together on the person’s birthday and then the next day we go celebrate with other family (aunt/uncle  grandparents). Because my social circle is so small  I felt like my only solace was knowing I could at least be with my family. I found out today that nobody wanted to have dinner together (the only reason we are now is because my sister talked to my parents  but my mom is peeved about it). I also told my parents I was looking forward to seeing the rest of the family and that’s when they decided to tell me we weren’t because they were going to a party. I don’t mind if they want to go out  that’s their own prerogative  I’m just hurt that they weren’t even going to tell me until I mentioned being excited about that day. I’d love to go spend time with my other family myself  but nobody gets together unless EVERYONE’S there (if that makes sense?). Maybe it’s stupid and hypocritical for me to say all this and feel this way since I’m not even looking forward to my birthday myself. The mood swings and depression are just really bad right now and I feel really alone so I just needed to get it off my chest.

bipolar,Does anyone ever feel like nobody actually cares about you and you are lonely,"Disclaimer: I haven’t been tested for bipolar but I’ve been told I might because i was told I have the symptoms and my das and half sister have bipolar 

So basically This causes me to do outrageous things like most of my friends I got are online due to my social anxiety and lack of social skills and I get periods of highs where I feels like everyone likes me and like I’m friends with everyone and then a few hours I be feeling low as hell and like nobody talks to me and like I’m the ugliest at my school and everyone just uses me for homework and nobody texts me other than to get stuff from me and this causes me to sometimes unfriend people on social media because I think this way 
I keep my thoughts in my head and don’t tell anyone because I don’t want to burden anyone which would lead to me having no friends

I just want to get the same attention and affection which I give out and be loved by someone man but I know I have no redeeming qualities I can’t even talk without stuttering I’m nothing to anybody man and it makes me want to die

I really hope reincarnation is real so that I can redo a lot of things and have a normal family that isn’t abusive and so that I’m not ugly like I am now",5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/rzcde6/does_anyone_ever_feel_like_nobody_actually_cares/

I’ve had 4 MRI’s so far. It was fine. But it got harder with each one. The idea of another makes my skin crawl and my breath cease up. Almost the feeling before you hyperventilate.

bipolar,Bipolar Psychologist Here,Hi fam  I’m a clinical psychologist with bipolar 1 and had my first manic episode with psychosis in my PhD program back in 2016. I feel very isolated with my illness because I’m “tokenized” among my friends and colleagues for being so high functioning to the point where my difficulties get unnoticed  which is fine  because the alternative is having my friends/colleagues/director of my practice see me as a flight risk - which REALLY bothers me. Because of this and the idealization and pressure that people put on psychologists to be perfect beacons of mental health and wellness  (we’re not - hello  I am here)  I feel like I’m masking 24/7 and like I’m not allowed to express my mental health difficulties  especially racing thoughts  poor impulse control  low self-esteem  and complex trauma etc because of how people perceive and idealize me based on my job. It’s complicated because I prefer being seen as idealized and high functioning but I also want my struggles seen  validated  and understood. So here I am being vulnerable on in an anonymous way on the Internet in hopes of connecting with folks who share my struggle. I feel so alone in this illness because I don’t feel “sick enough” but I am fucking sick enough. Please don’t come at me or question my clinical abilities because I have bipolar - I very much keep myself in check and have been a therapist for 12 years without mishap. I guess I just need to vent and am hoping to connect. The irony of being both a doctor and a patient is not lost on me and proves to be a very liminal and lonely space. I’ve been in my own therapy on and off for 25 years and somehow don’t know how I made it this far in life. Anything helps. I’m so lonely.

bipolar,I feel so alone...seriously  fuck this shit...,"Ok...here goes I...

I was ""recently"" diagnosed with Bipolar Type I disorder about a year ago during my fourth stay at a facility for alcoholism. In retrospect  the signs were all there for me to see... The unnecessary and overreactive anger and self-harm. The  sometimes brash  cocksuredness of my intellect  wit  and other skills/abilities. The phases of feeling euphoric at times contrasted with periods of melancholy. But the bottom line is that no one  myself included  thought I had anything wrong going on  it was just ""me"".

Fast forward to today and I am fresh out of a five day stay at a mental health facility  reeling from what is by far my most lengthy manic episode (three months or so in total  with the last three weeks or so being absolutely bonkers). My doctor and I are trying to figure out all the right meds currently  but honestly my biggest problem RN is a sense of loneliness  guilt  and an inability to make others understand what I am feeling or going through. 

I have  for lack of better words  been a manipulative  lying  cheating  self-agrandized twat my entire life. While witty  intelligent  and even charming - I have used those skills to get myself out of things  take advantage of people  and veil myself from any semblance of accountability  true love  and the general reality of my life  especially when others are concerned. Having crippling alcoholism and dealing with that the same way I have dealt with everything else in my life doesn't help either.

Admittedly  I feel like everything happening right now is a penance for all of my past mistakes and that I have a lot of work to do to mend my relationships with friends and loved ones. However  it's ironic that right now is probably the time I need those people the most  and while for once  probably in my life  I'm being honest - it's to no avail  because my past manipulative  lying self has finally caught up to me. I feel so alone  maybe deservedly  maybe not  regardless  it's how I feel and it sucks.

I don’t think self-harm is a borderline exclusive trait but for some reason she tried to say I’m borderline because of this? 

Does anyone else with bipolar have a history of self-harm? I mainly do it when I’m depressed however I did once do it in a particularly bad mixed episode ",14,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1fje1yp/self_harm_and_bipolar/
bipolar,As of today  I’m 6 months self harm free,I guess I just wanted to share that I’ve been clean for 6 months. I don’t really have anybody else that I can tell or would care. I never thought I would get to this point. Half a year. I made a promise to myself that I would never self harm again for the rest of my life and I meant it. 6 months ago from today I was at the lowest point I have ever been in my life. Right after I got out of the last mental hospital  I knew that I was going to change. That I was going to fight for my life and peace. I made the decision to live and end the self harm. These 6 months have not been easy  the urges are still very real. I think about it everyday. I have nightmares about it. I can’t even get a paper cut without being triggered. I hope that this will get better with more time because it’s really hard. I’m not sure how to feel about this but I think I’m really proud of myself.,147,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/16x6nk0/as_of_today_im_6_months_self_harm_free/
bipolar,tw how do you cope with panic attacks/self harm,"
how do you cope through the moments when you’ve completely lost control? how do you keep from hurting yourself? 

i actually just concluded a severe depressive episode as im writing this and i need help  i journal during really extreme moments but its not helping  i lose control over my mind and my body and yesterday i almost got put inpatient (im seriously surprised i didnt) because i slammed my head into the concrete and got a huge lump and i was completely erratic. everytime i have one of these episodes i hear so many people that i know telling me terrible things and i end up chanting it to myself aloud and becoming so overwhelmed i hit myself in the head or scratch or slap or do anything i can to make myself stop  but nothing stops. and in these moments my therapist advised me if i can to journal and so i have been trying but ill still lose control and throw the notebook or stab it or hit my hands on it (which is still better than myself). 

i really don’t want to be this way it eats me alive and it effects all of my relationships and im just so scared  i can feel myself coming more undone. i cant reason with myself or tell myself things aren’t real or happening until way after the fact and it scares me. i’m unmedicated but i am seeking treatment  and im waiting for a call back right now but i know it will take time for me to even settle down into my meds and i really can’t keep living like this. i try so hard to keep a routine and do simple tasks like hygiene and cleaning and laundry to keep myself busy but nothing is distracting enough. i just lost my job and im pretty sure it’s because i had moments like this at work i can’t keep it together at all anymore and i was wondering if any of you would have advice ",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1hw2sx7/tw_how_do_you_cope_with_panic_attacksself_harm/
bipolar,Cutting off family to protect myself and them ??,I know everyone has their own trauma that contributes to bpd so I won’t get into the details of mine however I need help!! Has anyone ever considered cutting off their family members because #1 they do not acknowledge their own behaviors towards u such as saying you’re too much or extra when they are asking u to speak about triggering subjects. #2 blame you for how u explain and speak when you’re feeling emotionally overwhelmed or remove yourself completely by shutting ur mouth and walking out the room and then being followed out said room for a follow up convo. So when I go into a manic episode because now I’m pissed as fuck it’s no longer about the initial conversation it’s about how I respond abusively??? I know I can be EVIL when I split however I can’t explain things sometimes without feeling overwhelmed or rushing my speech bc I feel fight or flighty so in these vulnerable moments when I feel judged I split. Should I cut to the chase and cut off my family to protect my nervous system and not have me say more mean things :(( pls have compassion I’m really trying to seek some advice ,5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1dcfym9/cutting_off_family_to_protect_myself_and_them/
bipolar,Would you be a mom/father,"I’m not sure how to start this but it’s been something I’ve been thinking about. I’m 24f and I’m not planning on having anytime soon but the thought plagues me. Would you have your own children or have you (m/f/nb) 
I was diagnosed 2 years ago and one of the first things my mother told me was you can never have children or you’ll hate them/ go manic . (Completely bs according to studies) Anyways no one else in my family is diagnosed with anything but adhd. I think to myself about this often. 

Would I want to give this genetic predisposition to a child… The likelihood is believed to be 15% to 30%  meaning if the goal is 2  there’s a 45% (30-60%) chance that one would inherit the disorder. But at the end of the day it’s like rolling dice. You can get lucky and have 4 without or have 1 with. It fucks me up to think about. 

Would I carry my husband’s baby with someone else’s egg. It’s makes me wanna cry that I’m cutting myself out of the future  that none of me would go on after I’m gone. I have great qualities  my ancestors were Olympians  I’m good looking  my father has the memory of a hawk. These are things I’d love to pass down. As far as my disorder I was diagnosed at 23 and ya the first couple of months were traitorous but since then (now 25) it’s been manageable  almost easy. 

I’d like to ask from all of you is:
1. Would you have your own?
2. If you’re a woman how did the hormones affect you (before/after)
3. What was the outcome if you did have

Thank you for sharing anything.

Edit

After reading many responses here are the key things I’d like to highlight.

1. Your undiagnosed siblings/relatives are not having this moral debate yet do have the chance to pass down BP

2. Getting an egg is not that simple  the girls that donate are typically under 25 and the average age for diagnosis in women is 27. And sure maybe they’re family history is perfect but so is mine and I’m here…

3. Any human that has a younger egg has a higher chance at a healthier baby and any human that has an older egg has a higher chance at complications.

bipolar,Cut my hair today by myself after getting laid off by a job,"So this job was my dream job. A costume shop. I worked for them for a year. They said they were moving locations and were going to be out of work for about a month but that they'd be in touch with me for when they get back up and running. 
I got a part time job to pay rent in the meantime and messaged my employers about half way through the month when I hadn't heard anything. 
They ignored me the ENTIRE MONTH. 
When I finally got a hold of someone it was the new assistant manager (old coworker of the same level but not position. She was a seamstress and I was a sales associate) we sent text messages for a good hour about how excited we were for the store to be back up and running until I finally asked when I'll be coming back and then through text she said that the company couldn't have me back due to financial reasons. 
I cried the entire day. It happened a couple weeks ago. I'm still a little heartbroken but I'm mostly angry now. 
Anyway I cut my hair by myself and it looks really good! I've gotten nothing but compliments even from strangers so I'm really confident about it. I think I'm starting to feel a lot better now.",21,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/117rslv/cut_my_hair_today_by_myself_after_getting_laid/

bipolar,I get bored and cut people off easily but I can't force myself to feel anything," So for a few years I've been starting to notice that whenever I get into relationships with people  the first few months feel really unnaturally intense feelings and I have a huge rush of emotion and adrenaline thinking about the person and being around them  but then after a while it's like I just lose interest all together out of nowhere and get bored if I haven't just started to dislike them completely for no reason. I've had problems with love bombing people in the past  but this is a separate and more of a personal internal thing.

I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder (not 100% confident of that diagnosis but that's a whole different conversation) and a few other things  and between episodes all I experience is super intense numbness and a lack of feeling for my surroundings. Not so much being depressed as just I feel absolutely nothing and can't bring myself to care about anything or feel things about what's happening  being in depressive episodes is much different than this and this is what I experience the majority of the time. Everything kind of just feels like I'm going through the motions of my life every day with absolutely no feeling behind it.

The reason that I bring this up  is because my current partner is the first person I can confidently say that I've been IN love with and not just had an intense fling  and when I'm away from them I know that I love them but feel absolutely nothing for them unless they're in the room with me. I'm not bored or seeking anything in other people and I don't want to be without them  I'm extremely comfortable and I feel loved being with them. But unless they're physically with me  I feel absolutely nothing for them and it makes me feel like shit because I know for a fact that I love them. I think about them a lot and I miss them often  and I enjoy talking to other people about them  but there isn't really any emotion behind it.

In the past this disconnect has made it very easy for me to drop connections with people with little to no feeling at all  and I feel super cold and awful about it but I can't force myself to feel anything even if I know it's a big deal. In the exact opposite sense  when it comes to people that I'm aware I have a strong connection and feelings for even if I'm not actively experiencing them because they aren't there with me  I have extremely bad attachment issues. Connections with people ever being cut when I haven't done it myself or ever having to lose contact people feels more like grieving a death and causes months of intense physical and emotional pain that's kind of hard to describe but is the main reason I get afraid of forming any new relationships with people. It sounds terrible  but I've never had a super close relationship with my parents (though recently it's improved)  and I can easily stomach the thought of never speaking to them again. But if it were a close friend or a partner  I go into spiraling panic attacks and have what almost feels like an intense depressive episode split into separate fits.

I know that I love my partner  and I experience this issue with everyone in my life (even close family) and not just in romantic relationships  but because it's the first time I've been in love I'm wondering if this is just normal and I've fallen out of it and am in denial or if it has a different mental reason. I've talked to my psychiatrist about the possibility of having bpd or something other than/in addition to bipolar because there are several things that run in my family and it was brought up to me by a friend that I should consider asking about it  but I don't want to self diagnose myself and she told me that typically she can see bpd immediately in patients so I don't want to push the idea and convince myself that I have something I don't. It's also difficult because I'm the first person on either side of my family to have been diagnosed and treated for a disorder  but I and other people in my family are very confident that many other family members experience similar things and just don't realize/haven't gotten treatment  so I'm kind of just figuring this shit out on my own and I don't want to claim that I have something when I don't and I don't know what to do.

Has anyone else experienced this ++ can someone help me out or give me advice? Not really sure what specific advice to ask for but it's been bothering me for a really long time and I don't have anyone else to talk to about it.

bipolar,"Therapist leaving the session without a word because ""I'm too intelligent"".","Yesterday afternoon  about ten minutes into our session my now fired therapist decided to end the call in the middle of my talking. 

Why you ask? 

Because for the 8th week in a row he asked me what I want from therapy and suggested that I'm too intelligent and my life isn't falling apart  because I seem to have the tools and thought to get myself through without therapy. 

I've told him what therapy can do for me. 

I have borderline personality disorder and I'm Bipolar 1. 

Even if it's just talk therapy for the BPD  it's enough. 

When I ask why he is insinuating I don't need therapy he says he isn't saying that at all  but that he doesn't understand why I'm in therapy if it seems I've got all the pieces and I'm obviously intelligent. He then makes a slight dig at his other patients (this isn't the first time) and I told him:

If I knew why I needed to be in therapy I doubt I'd actually be here. 
I then began to tell him that I am not in school for psychology and that is his purview and then the call cuts. We are online  so the video just ends. 

Nothing said on his end  just got an email that he canceled the session about ten minutes in. 

I have always stayed away from male therapists and as a black AFAB queer  I typically stay away from Evangelical black therapists  but this just took the cake. 

I have never had a therapist do this shit and it was the cherry on top of an already stressesful week that's caused a personality fracture. Mentally  I am unwell and I have exams this week (and last week too but like 👍🏾) and a presentation I need to resubmit because his bullshit derailed me so bad I couldn't do my homework.

Thanks for coming to my sad ass TEDtalks.

SIDE NOTE: This man also asked me for 6 weeks straight to write a book and would spent most of my session asking questions about queerness and my history with sex work.

She has also helped me learn that it's okay to be happy without focusing on the impending sadness  I can enjoy themood I'm in. I was so focused on my future moods and the destruction and terror they could bring that I never savored the moment.

bipolar,I'm bipolar and sick of being someone's burden. I don't want to die  but I just wish I could disappear and let them be happy.,I know this is nothing that anybody who is bipolar and has been depressed hasn't felt at some moment in time. I just need to hear some other stories to stop wallowing in self-pity. It's been 8 years since the diagnosis (bipolar II). I'm 24 years old. I thought I was getting my life on track finally. I just did the spring semester full-time--with a 3.53 GPA  first time I've been full-time since fall 2007 freshman year. However  the cost of success was that I had no social life. The few friends  I had I pushed away. I wanted to be alone but resented every second of it. When I was around family  I usually felt better. The problem is  if I call upon them and their help  I'm causing them problems. They'd never phrase it that way  but I am a burden to them. My mom worries about me even when I'm doing well. She still cries herself to sleep whenever I slip up or just stress her out when I'm manic and overbearing. I know having more support in my life would help me. I see a psychiatrist and see another doctor for therapy. I work out to try and achieve wellness. At the end of the day  I just feel alone  and I'm afraid to establish any new significant relationships in my life. I'm protecting myself from being hurt when said relationships ultimately end in pain bc these individuals can't handle my illness. Also I feel like I'm preventing myself from being someone else's burden again. I know I'm punishing myself and a lot of it isn't rational. I just wish the cycle could end and the guilt would stop. I don't want to die. I'm not really content with life  but I haven't given up on my future….possibly I have given up on my present. I'm not suicidal. I couldn't put my family through that. I do feel like they'd be better off if I wasn't around anymore. They would be free from worrying about my problems and changing their lives to accommodate me. So  I kinda wish I could disappear. I wish I could run away and start over somewhere else. I wish I could just leave my family and not have them worry about it and hate me for doing it. Rationally  I won't run  or I haven't gotten to that point yet.

bipolar,Uncontrollable emotions? Everything is fine and life is great (for days) until one thing happens with my SO and I spiral to just wanting to disappear and stop existing.,"I’m just typing incoherently into the void  hoping to find someone who understands.

I feel like I’m such a logical person  I am trying to make sense of what is going on inside my head. I don’t know if this is just me and has nothing to do with being bipolar  or if this is a bipolar thing. I’m just so tired of trying to figure myself out and then thinking I did and then falling back into the intense emotional cycles that I just can’t ignore and then make my SO’s problem as well. And if these are the normalities of bipolar  how do I help my SO see that I’m not trying to cause so much hurt on purpose.

There is a lot of hurt on both sides in our relationship stemming from a few years of bad mental health on my end. I got depressed from a health issue and didn’t know I was depressed  mental health was not something ever on my radar. There was a lot of misunderstanding and fighting (we had never experienced the intense fights that started happening and it was really traumatic) and trying to claw our way out of depressions for a couple years that left us with a lot of scars. It made me try to work on myself in a new way by self reflecting like I’ve never done before. Because of looking at my patterns I realized that I am most likely bipolar. I didn’t know anything about bipolar  I never perceived it to be what it is  it seems like one night the answer just popped into my head and it all made sense and I have been researching and learning ever since.

My mental health decline ended up affecting my SO as well (and we have recently noticed that he never learned to process emotions when he was young or talk about his feelings which lead to a lot of years of putting his feelings aside leading him into a depression as well). Because of this (or maybe always) our relationship isn’t balanced  I feel like I am the difficult one so I end up making all the decisions and he just goes with what I want. I don’t want this to be like this. I don’t like feeling the pressure to lead our life. I get that I have guided it there and I don’t know how to change it. I feel like our relationship has changed so much that I don’t really recognize it. I’m not sure what a relationship is even suppose to feel like anymore. I feel like we keep analyzing ourselves and analyzing each other and trying to find what is wrong to make things better. I miss the loving safe feeling that used to be there. I made him so self conscious and unstable. After years of mental health struggles and just wanting to be happy again  I want nothing more than to reset and move on and feel normal again. And then this makes me so frustrated and sets me off emotionally because I see this defeated look in his eyes and it just makes me feel like everything is hopeless and the future is bleak and then I spiral and get sad about my mental health and how I am just a huge problem causing tangle of a person and this is going to be my whole life  fighting my brain to be happy and not cause shit. And I am so scared of feeling these emotions that I make it his problem.

I finally reached out to a therapist for a consultation today  because I just feel so tired and hopeless trying to find a way out of these emotions. And my SO is so tired of my shit. I don’t feel like a bad person but what I do to him and how he tells me what I do really makes me feel like a bad person. Nothing I say or do is meant to be intentionally hurtful to him  its like I am just so emotional and scared of the emotions and trying to make them go away. I feel like I am going in circles in my head trying to make logical sense of my emotions.

bipolar,I think I understand why bipolar people want to disappear,"I’ve been treated for bipolar 2 for a couple of years now. I have been feeling pretty good even during this pandemic and I’m actually pretty surprised..but a couple of little interactions I had this past weekend though have made my mental situation turn for the worse. 

I took a long walk today and started thinking about how I wanted to disappear  I was just hurting so much. I started thinking about getting into my car and driving off  and sleeping in a parking lot so I wouldn’t have to go home. My boyfriend who I’m living with has been temperamental today and has given me the silent treatment for a day and a half. It makes me feel so sad. 

I spoke about depression and suicide to a friend of mine this past Friday who didn’t really understand it and now I am afraid I’ve shared too much and I feel so embarrassed that he knows the extent of how I suffer. He was supportive but everything was done in text  I don’t think I could’ve spoken to him otherwise. I just feel so mentally naked. I feel like he’ll think I’m a drama queen or think less of me. 

I also talked to my bf about a mutual friend of ours who I stopped from committing suicide. He got so angry at me when he found out because he said it was wrong for me to approach a person the way I did  being so direct  and assuming I understand what was going on with that person. “But I was right”  I told him  “I got him help”. I think he was distressed finding out that this person had a day planned already  and I helped him get out of that mindset and get help. Now I’m sad I think that’s the reason why bf has been acting so weird and not talking to me. I just don’t think he knows what to do with that knowledge especially with a friend who he respects very much. I on the other hand am sad that I can’t share deep experiences with him because I risk being misunderstood. What did I do wrong I ask myself. Because For that one moment in time I know saved someone.

I’m distressed too because of my family. I think I’m letting them down. I’m not living with my parents right now because of the pandemic  I don’t want to risk infecting them. I am living with my boyfriend/fiancée. I spoke to my mom yesterday and she asked me where I was  all worried. All  wanted me to do is just come home. She said my room was ready for me when things quiet down. 

What she doesn’t get is I don’t want to live with her anymore. When I spoke to her  the vulnerability and desperation in her voice was just overwhelming for me. Her best friend just died of covid 19 and I’m sure she still grieving. 

I also don’t like my old room because I think it’s haunted. 

My parents are kind and good people but are very hard to live with.

My mom is overbearing and controlling  she’s explosive and has an anger problem. My dad on the other hand is very self-centered  unreasonable  controlling  obsessive and out of touch. The kind of guy who argues with you and fights with you when you want him to go to the barber for his son’s wedding. He wanted to cut his own hair himself  even though it always ends up looking like a disaster zone. He just thinks he’s that good. For the wedding  He wanted to wear an ugly old suit he got from the thrift shop and kept insisting that was just fine. When we went to a real place to get a new suit for him  he was upset and sulked the whole way. While he was being fitted for the suit  he stood there and glared at me  all angry because i think he thought I was second guessing him and underestimating him... who knows what else goes through his mind. He is also obsessive compulsive and likes to hoard things like fruit and shoes. 

My boyfriend asked me to marry him and that is an additional stressor. I love him and I’m almost forty. But at the same time  I am poor and angry at myself for not being able to have a better job and more financial security. He is not financially secure either but overall I do like living with him.
How can we have the wedding we want if we can’t even afford it?

In addition I’ve been doing some sewing projects and arts and crafts. I love being creative but even something that brings me joy and excites me is coming out looking all messed up and ugly. I was trying to enter a contest that ends tonight. It was for a mask making contest in my neighborhood. My vision of what I wanted didn’t translate into reality and I’m very disappointed. My mask looks terrible.

Also I’ve been having obsessive thoughts about an ex of mine. Very sad and very self hating thoughts. I’m convinced that I’m psychically connected to him and I’ve done my best to let go but I can’t seem to cut the bond. The last time I saw him was fifteen years ago and yet everything still feels fresh even though he’s moved on and so have I. Unbeknownst to me I get obsessively thinking about him and his family and what could’ve been and it always happens when there’s a big event in his family. Like an anniversary or someone having kids. I just want the connection to end. To feel so strongly connected to him is just torture.

So here I am sitting in the living room unsure of whether I want to sleep or scream or watch tv or go into my car and disappear for a few days. I’m just so unbelievably frustrated  I haven’t gotten to the point that I want to die  thank God  but I just feel like I’m wandering from one empty room to another in my mind. I was feeling so good the past couple of months but this weekend I feel like a darkness has descended over me. Like someone just threw a wet blanket at me. It’s so uncomfortable. If I didn’t have to shower and use the bathroom I wouldn’t have minded actually leaving the house for a few days and sleeping at a shopping mall parking lot. I scooped a couple of places out actually while I was on my walk.  But I ruled out places where I could possibly be towed/wheel booted while I was inside. 

Writing is helping me a lot. I am on medication and it’s worked well for me. I feel physically good. Unfortunately my therapist had to let me go because she got to sick to see me.

bipolar,I just want to disappear.,"I haven't hit rock bottom in a while and it feels like I'm getting pretty close. I have been trying to keep myself busy and productive and it's not helping. Now I just hate myself for spending money and making unrealistic goals. I have gone through the house and removed all decor that I had a say in. I put away my hobby stuff and I honestly want as little interaction with anyone as possible.

I know that it will pass. I know that shutting myself off probably won't help. I just don't want to do this shit anymore. Right now  in this moment  I am so fucking tired of anything that has to do with me.

bipolar,Being bipolar during the dissertation phase of a PhD is kind of a mindfuck,"Just wanted to share something I’ve been sitting with. I’m deep into the PhD right now—dissertation phase  mostly self-directed—and realizing how slippery the whole thing becomes when you’re bipolar.

When I’m in a depressive spell  the work just… disappears. Not in a dramatic crisis way  just quietly fades from view. Time passes  things don’t get done  and I can’t bring myself to care or panic. And then when I’m up again  I get this burst of productivity and start trying to make up for everything all at once. It’s a cycle I can see  but not always stop.

I guess I’m not really asking for strategies or advice—just curious if others out there are going through the same thing. PhD work is already isolating  and this just makes it more so. Would love to hear from anyone who’s been there or is in it now.",127,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1jp9aaa/being_bipolar_during_the_dissertation_phase_of_a/
bipolar,depressed... everything hurts..?,I can't remember if this it typical  but I'm like sore and heavy all over. I'm quite depressed. In an episode brought on by circumstances.

bipolar,I did it… I got a decently paying low stress part time job,"And it fell in my lap!

For years  my family has been trying to encourage me to work part time. I didn’t know how to seek out work like this. Everything I saw seemed to be full time or part time retail paying less than $15/hr. I also just couldn’t get my foot in the door. My resume gap seemed to hurt me everywhere I went. So much so that back in December  I broke down and opened a case with the Office of Vocational Rehab.

I went to a couple OVR appointments and it didn’t seem like they were going to offer me anything beyond what I can already do for myself. Then  a few weeks ago  just completely out of the blue  I got a text from an attorney I used to interact with through an old job (I used to work full time for a friend’s nonprofit  but it was stressful and I only lasted a year). Could I do some part time paralegal work? Her current paralegal is overwhelmed.

I’m not a certified paralegal but I have a Master’s Degree in a different field and I’m a smart person. I can also speak Spanish  which is necessary for working with this attorney’s clients. I’m starting with 10 hours a week and I’m being paid $30/hr! It doesn’t get much better based on my qualifications and schedule.

The best part? I started today (the 13th anniversary of the day I arrived in the hospital in a state of full blown psychotic mania) and y’all… I am in my element. I get to proofread and edit documents  interact with clients in a limited  low-stress fashion  make my own schedule  do it all from home  and make a reasonable wage! I won’t get rich but that’s not what I’m looking to do. I think I can get used to this!",542,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1jf78ku/i_did_it_i_got_a_decently_paying_low_stress_part/

bipolar,The Weight of Waking Up,"

I woke up today 
but it feels like I didn’t.
Like my body moved from the bed to the floor
to the couch 
but my mind stayed buried under the sheets.

Everything feels too much.
The light hurts.
The air feels heavy.
The sound of my own breathing is a reminder
that I’m still here—
and I don’t know if I want to be.

I scroll through my phone 
looking for something to shake me out of it 
but every word feels like static 
every image like a weight pressing on my chest.
Even the things I love feel distant 
like they’re just beyond the fog 
too far to reach.

My kids need me today 
but I don’t know how to give.
How to pour from a cup that’s cracked 
that’s empty 
that feels like it’s never been full.
I smile because I have to 
but it doesn’t reach my eyes 
and I think they notice.
God  I hope they don’t notice.

The worst part isn’t the sadness.
It’s the nothingness.
The way my mind goes blank 
like I’ve forgotten how to be a person.
The way my body feels like a shell 
moving through routines I don’t even recognize.
Brush your teeth.
Make breakfast.
Don’t cry.
Don’t let them see.

And the guilt—
it’s suffocating.
Because I know there’s no reason for this.
I have a roof over my head 
food on the table 
people who love me.
But depression doesn’t care about reasons.
It doesn’t care about logic.
It just exists 
like a shadow I can’t outrun.

I tell myself it’s just a day.
That I’ve survived worse.
But today  survival feels like a cruel kind of punishment.
Like I’m being asked to carry the weight of my own existence
without a map 
without a break.

I don’t know how to fix this.
I don’t know if I can.
All I know is that I woke up today 
and that’s all I’ve got.

bipolar,I made a mistake at work and now everything hurts,"Due to my procrastination and some other matters  something small at work became a big issue and my probation was extended for the second time.

I guess it's the stress  but after that living has become horrible. Everything hurts; my mind  my body  and I guess my soul as well. Living is currently painful for me  and I just want it to stop.

I've tried talking to my family  and their response is for me to just take responsibility for my action. They aren't wrong  but it doesn't resolve the stress I'm undergoing. It doesn't change the fact that I'm in pain right now and just want it to stop.

Due to my bipolar disorder  I've been see-sawing between wanting to end it all (depression) and wanting to quit my job (hypomania). I'm barely hanging on  even though I know the pain will eventually stop once the issue is resolved. But I'm caught by the thought that if another issue pops up  I have to go through this pain again.

I'm seeing my psychiatrist next Monday and will be asking her for some meds to help cope with the pain. But the next few days will be painful for me  and I'm already so tired.

I'm not sure why I'm telling this. Am I looking for advice? Or am I just telling it to dull the pain? But thank you for reading.",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/x8zdwr/i_made_a_mistake_at_work_and_now_everything_hurts/

bipolar,Choosing not to medicate isn’t about you alone,"Seeing a ton of posts where people think treating bipolar without any medicine is ok. It’s not.

Honestly  for other stuff … if it’s your own body you can do what you want and have your beliefs. Not recommended but whatever.

Bipolar is different.
Keep in mind  that this is an illness that can potentially hurt those around you even more.

So risking mania I feel just isn’t fair.
True manic episodes can be very destructive to people around us and society. 

I’ve been violent and a danger to others. 
We can ruin lives.
You can say this would never be you but you don’t know that won’t happen. Nor does anyone with any degree.

I believed I was an ultra genius who had it all under control  then I became violent too. Your judgement isn’t enough.

“Oh  but I’ve been OK for so long….”.
That means the meds are working … not that the condition is gone.

“My doctor says it’s ok and I told him I won’t do medication.”

A. Doctor is not correct. He may lose his license at some point as mine did

B. Sometimes people bend the truth here. You can coerce your doctor by giving ultimatums.  

If I tell my GP “ I won’t do bipolar medication  but you can treat me for everything else”…. A doctor might say .. “ok  I understand and can help you adhere to this boundary” and that leads to a patient extrapolating that “the doctor says he is ok with it”. Or a similar scenario. 

A doctor sometimes will try to treat as best as he can within limits.

C. You coerce the doctor into historical revisionism. And get him to believe that you don’t have bipolar.


Edit: By “meds” I mean any sort of evidence based peer reviewed treatment (ECT is meds). We are works in progress but don’t give up on the work.

Don’t think that it’s not working unless a doctor says that. It prevents and dampens episodes. It’s gonna be hard to feel like it’s working.


What do meds even do?

-Make the severity less intense.

So even if you have a period of no episodes for years … it’s a good idea to lessen the severity of one that could happen. Don’t pretend you can predict when it will hit.

-Help prevent episodes.

If you’ve been on meds and feel good enough to stop. Don’t stop that means meds have been working.",338,160,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/10koqav/choosing_not_to_medicate_isnt_about_you_alone/

My last manic episode destroyed my life and I don't know how to fix it. 

In these months I managed to wreck two cars and get arrested 4 times. Drank heavily and made an absolute fool of myself. I created a huge debt that will take lifetimes to pay off. 

I lost my job  and I will have to sell my house  my pets and become homeless. It's like I deliberately did everything to burn down my life in every way possible. Worst part is my manic self was so happy and had so much fun doing it. Everything was just like a joke. 

I can't get a break because every day I have to deal with these consequences. I'm now a felon  with huge debt  can't get a job because of my record  have no car or drivers licence. Alone and isolated. 

Selling my house and losing my pets feels impossible. I don't know how to even deal with this. Sorting out my things  nowhere to move them to. 

I had a good life  I used to have it all. Would give anything to have it back and have a normal life with normal problems. But my old life is gone forever.   

I struggle with anxiety and stress  wake up to a nightmare every day. I'm feel so ashamed of all the crazy sht I've done and don't know how to live with myself. 

I'm broken. I lost all stability  don't know who I am anymore  lost all sense of safety. 

I need a break to heal but there's so much I have to deal with. On top of this I also have a physical illness that I struggle with. 

If one year ago I'd asked myself ""what's the worst that can happen?""  this would most probably be it. My worst fears coming alive.

bipolar,I think I'm so broken nobody will ever love me,"**Multiple trigger warnings here. Self harm  sexual and emotional abuse  eating disorders  suicide.**

Forgive my rambling

I am a 21 year old transgender woman. I doubt much about me will get much sympathy  more have been through far worse. Idk  here's my story

I've not been given a formal diagnosis but my doctors all agree I'm either bipolar 1 or borderline personality disorder. I take Seroquel trazodone and Xanax. They've been helping

To start with the lightest stuff  I am a less than passable trans woman. I was an extremely unattractive man and am slightly better as a woman I guess. I've always struggled with my looks  at various times going through different eating disorders and patterns of self harm. I lost 50 lbs in a year through this.

I was bullied my entire childhood. I've never got in for a laundry list of reasons  I was bullied and called a faggot daily into middle school which made me later repress how I felt as a woman until I turned 18. I have highly functional Aspergers  and that was something further to make me a black sheep and an outcast from my peers. 

My ex and I had a bad relationship. I don't know if I can call it abuse since he was never anything but honest with me. He would tell me he loved me while also telling me how unattractive I am. I found out he was done with me when I opened my phone and found a picture of him and his new girlfriend together. He got her pregnant after a month and the kid was born a couple weeks ago. They are apparently doing well

I had a prolonged mental breakdown after this  and every friend I sought comfort in eventually found they were better off cutting me out from their lives. I had two separate suicide attempts  both which landed me in the hospital and one in inpatient care. I have no friends at all left anymore. 

I think my hangups with sex are a large part of what alienated my previous partners. I was molested as a kid  the memory is foggy but I remember parts clearly. I hate myself for it but I have a lot of dark thoughts about sex and some really rough fantasies. I have never told anybody this  not even my therapist. I don't think I ever will. I've always wanted a partner I could trust to work through my issues with but with no luck. I think that I scared off the very few chances I had at love by having such a hyperactive  emotionally stunted sexuality. 

I've tried dating with little luck. I have a deep distrust of men ingrained in my by the way all of my previous partners treated me and due to my past. I'm pansexual and I do feel more comfortable with women  but I find myself more physically attracted to men in spite of my distrust.  

I don't think I will ever meet someone I can be with. There are so many damned hurdles for anyone interested to jump through.

I am currently in a psych ward for a year now ( 6 months fully residential   6 months daytherapy)
When i told them  they reacted very mad telling me that they cant help me with more meds ( after i told them i think my meds arent working enough) because i’m already taking a fair amount.
But that i have to rely on self care and the tools i learned in that year.
I feel lonely and not understood by the only people i trust at the moment.

Do you think i’m in the wrong for relying more on my meds than the tools i learned? Im so lost thinking i did everything wrong. ",11,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1iqxyjx/im_lost_need_helpadvice/

bipolar,Bipolar Psychologist Here,Hi fam  I’m a clinical psychologist with bipolar 1 and had my first manic episode with psychosis in my PhD program back in 2016. I feel very isolated with my illness because I’m “tokenized” among my friends and colleagues for being so high functioning to the point where my difficulties get unnoticed  which is fine  because the alternative is having my friends/colleagues/director of my practice see me as a flight risk - which REALLY bothers me. Because of this and the idealization and pressure that people put on psychologists to be perfect beacons of mental health and wellness  (we’re not - hello  I am here)  I feel like I’m masking 24/7 and like I’m not allowed to express my mental health difficulties  especially racing thoughts  poor impulse control  low self-esteem  and complex trauma etc because of how people perceive and idealize me based on my job. It’s complicated because I prefer being seen as idealized and high functioning but I also want my struggles seen  validated  and understood. So here I am being vulnerable on in an anonymous way on the Internet in hopes of connecting with folks who share my struggle. I feel so alone in this illness because I don’t feel “sick enough” but I am fucking sick enough. Please don’t come at me or question my clinical abilities because I have bipolar - I very much keep myself in check and have been a therapist for 12 years without mishap. I guess I just need to vent and am hoping to connect. The irony of being both a doctor and a patient is not lost on me and proves to be a very liminal and lonely space. I’ve been in my own therapy on and off for 25 years and somehow don’t know how I made it this far in life. Anything helps. I’m so lonely. Thank you. ,638,197,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1jptxkn/bipolar_psychologist_here/
bipolar,Sexuality question- really need help!!,Hi  I’m 21F and have considered myself to be gay for years now  but I recently met a guy (friends brother) who is making me seriously question that. The problem is I think I might be going into hypomania  I’m sleeping very little  lots of energy  mind racing  worried that I’m only into him bc of hypersexuality. So I’m wondering if anyone has had any experience with hypomania/mania affecting sexuality because I really don’t want to get in a relationship only to find that I’m not into him anymore when my mood is normal.,42,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/16srhs4/sexuality_question_really_need_help/
bipolar,HELP! Currently manic and need someone to answer these questions plz sry,"Hi I’m sorry to bother you all but I’m diagnosed with borderline personality disorder  PTSD and of course bipolar 2. I’m 33 and past few years I’ve begun to notice when I’m entering/in a manic episode. Sometimes they just end once I crash or I’ll come to in the hospital not remembering the past week/weeks. Anyway I’m on day 5 of maybe an hour or so of sleep a night.

Questions-
1. I keep hearing a faint noise of police sirens and it has me extremely paranoid even though I’m not doing anything illegal. Anyone else hear something similar?  it would just help to know I’m not alone right now

2. The sirens have me then moving from room to room because I don’t feel safe if I stay in one spot for more than a few minutes. Even though I know no one can see me through my windows in my first floor 2bed apartment. Still doesn’t stop me from thinking that someone sees me moving back and forth so they call the police cuz I’m acting weird.

So then I feel like I need to be able to hear my door open in case someone or police sneak in. So I put a laundry bag against the door. So if the police do actually come then can I get in trouble just for acting weird by blocking the door like that?? Can the police just let themselves in without knocking??


I know I’m being stupid and that the answers to these questions are obvious… still doesn’t stop the feeling of impending doom and paranoia… sorry to waste everyone’s time but it would just make me feel a lot better if someone could answer these questions or sympathize in some way.

bipolar,The pressure I feel every night before I go to bed.,"Every night I wonder why did I not do it today? What made me decide to stay? I suppose I’m hoping one day it will get better. Eventually you start to lose that hope because it’s only gotten worse for the past 3 years. I’m not angry or resentful. I do feel bad for the damage it would do to the few who care about me. I just don’t think no matter how hard I try  I’m going to get that “spark” to want to live again. 

Lately  I’ve been thinking back to the best time of a my life which truly was just a short section between A LOT of depression. I want to cry when I think about it because I have zero hope it ever gets back to being that good. At that time  I felt I was just on the cusp of finding even more meaning to life. Then it’s like I slowly started to unravel from there  and now we are so far away from that place that I don’t even feel like the same person. 

Anyways  since I didn’t do it today  I’m now asking myself what do I need to do to be excited about tomorrow. I have no idea. I’m going to be miserable either way and I’m tired of trying because I know I try harder than 99%.

bipolar,How do animals help with your bipolar disorder? ,"Anyone else feel like your pets save you from yourselves? 

I feel like my dogs keep me sane sometimes. In my first manic episode  I was hospitalized and missed the hell out of my dogs. My hospital advertised ""dog therapy"" events but never provided them  so I was dying to get discharged so I could see my puppies. 

In my second manic episode  I was hardly taking care of myself but my dog Bear (first pic) followed me everywhere and watched over me. When I was manic  I interpreted some of his mannerisms as reminders to go eat and drink water. Maybe it sounds silly  but it made sense at the time during my mania. He also slept with me every night  so I never felt alone. 

I'm so grateful for both of these puppies. Before I started displaying signs of bipolar  I definitely had MDD because I was always in these long periods of depression. My other dog from my childhood who passed away recently spent many crying spells in my room with me licking away my tears. 

I feel like my episodes would be so much harder without these empathetic creatures. They will see you at your worst but still love you and be excited to see you. Even when I'm feeling so low and down  they manage to put a smile on my face and warmth in my heart. 
It can be harder for me to connect with other people  but I never feel that when it comes to dogs or cats. They bring out the gentle side in me that has been hurt so much. 

Dogs have been such a vital part of my recovery  and I was wondering if others have been similarly touched/helped by their animals",337,99,https://i.redd.it/nu97mvs0zkvd1.jpeg
bipolar,Does anyone else experience an episode every night?,"My girlfriend has bipolar 1. When researching online  you'll read about how episodes will last weeks. And rapid cycling is defined as having 4 or more episodes a year..

My girlfriend is good about taking her medication.

During the day she is great mentally. However  99% of nights she will have a manic episode that lasts at least an hour  sometimes the whole night (6-8 hours)

This episode also often turns mixed or straight up depressed.

I was just wondering if this is a common experience?

When reading online  it seems the common experience is for it to last weeks of one episode  and also seems to not be so consistent. But also everyones different...

bipolar,Being manic isn’t “fun.”,"CW mania  self-harm  substance abuse  delusions

Being manic isn’t just “I hopped in my car and drove to New Mexico to do mescaline in the desert  what an adventure!” Or “Wow I redecorated the whole house in four days  so quirky!”

Being manic is spending hundreds of dollars on clothes you know you will never wear but being unable to stop yourself. Being manic is losing ten pounds in two weeks because you can’t eat without throwing up. Being manic is walking 7 miles a day until you’re physically shaking from exhaustion and not being able to sleep for even a couple hours afterwards. Being manic is fighting off delusions of being a literal god in the morning  and fighting off urges to self-harm because you’re a worthless mess of a human at night. Being manic is getting wasted at every party you go to until your friends stop inviting you to even casual hangouts. Being manic is having to explain why you burst into tears at a work meeting. Being manic is making your best friend cry because you screamed at her over a comment she made about your shoes. Being manic is begging your thoughts to stop racing through your head for even one minute  one god damn second  so you can relax  and knowing it’s not going to do any good and you just have to live like this until the bipolar roller coaster plunges you into depression again.

Mania isn’t cute or fun or nice. It’s a fucking nightmare. I wish people would stop romanticizing it and recognize that this is not something that any of us want to deal with. It’s hell.",571,166,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/n6oxp1/being_manic_isnt_fun/
bipolar,Every night before bed has become an existential crisis. I can't freaking take it anymore.,"It feels like garbage. I look and practically everyone around me as grown and I've gone backwards. My best friend is pursuing her career  lives at home but is almost done with her student loans and has her own vehicle. My other friend completely lives on her own  didn't go to school but is pursuing her area of work and is super happy. My ex  who I lost because of our mental health issues including him vastly maturing more than me  is doing really well pursuing his studies  lives on his own independently from his family  etc.

I'm stuck. I moved back with my parents for the summer. Graduating but going back to school for a post grad because I'm too useless to work on the specific skills outside of an academic environment. I feel I peaked in high school. I was passionate  driven  had a great relationship. The further I pursued post secondary  the worse I got mentally and the less I matured. I couldn't live away from home without cycling and being suicidal half the year.

I used to be so passionate about my hobbies and skills--such as art. I used to be so good and love it. Now every time I think about doing it I'm paralyzed from anxiety and when I finally force myself to do it  I end up having mental breakdowns because I just can't anymore. I can't make anything  I can't get better. I practice and it never works out. It triggered a god damn crisis situation the other day and my jaw is fucked from repeatedly punching myself in the face.

Every night for the past two weeks I've either been forcing myself to stay awake until I can't see straight. Ashamed of doing nothing all day. Or having a mental breakdown and crying to sleep. Both situations sleeping in late. Im just a shell of who I used to be and I'm getting worse and worse. I don't know what to do.

bipolar,Bipolar Type 1 destroyed my life.,"I worked so hard to be stable; therapy  meds. For 10 years I was stable  I pushed to get a career.

bipolar,My doctors says I’m stable but I absolutely hate myself & my life.,"I hate putting negative posts on here but I’ll be honest I feel like I’m at a stand still in my life. I was diagnosed at 21 after I went through a separation with a long-term girlfriend (first love) and ever since I’ve been pushing to find a purpose to keep going.

After the break up I did the typical things a young person would do to get over it  go on holidays  nights out & all the other stuff & that was when my manic episode happened. The episode was a typical one  blew my life savings on worthless shit  did some embarrassing stuff publicly on social media & thought I was destined for international fame (what a nob head).

Ever since my first episode it feels like my life has never fully recovered. I had a phase where I got back in to work and lost a load of weight and was starting to feel a little brighter about things but I was off my medication and another episode happened and similar stuff happened except I had no savings to spend!

It’s important to note both of these episodes happened after smoking Marijuana which seems to be a clear trigger for me.

This brings me to today  I am what they class as “stable” but I genuinely can’t think of many things I like about myself anymore  I hate my appearance & weight that I’ve gained from medication  I’m not exactly creative or talented & I don’t really have a great friendship group. 

I do have a really good job for a huge company but that is all I really think I have which is positive.

Plus I'm experiencing mood dysregulation so my mood stabilizer was increased last week when I went to a psychiatric urgent care. My psychiatrist wants to later increase my anti-psychotics to help with mood dysregulation as well. 

My mental health disorders are treatment-resistant. I got diagnosed in 2020 and the only difference I'm able to handle taking one sometimes two classes per semester. But my mental health is too disabling to allow me to work even if it was part-time or do college full-time.

Also  I have insomnia still and poor sleep quality. My ENT thinks I should see a sleep neurologist since all the prescribed sleep aids so far never make me sleepy  in other words  help me fall asleep sooner. Plus sleep schedule has pretty much chronically involved me going to bed late afternoon/early evening and waking up every day before 4 am. I get enough sleep every night but I think this sleep issue (I wake up throughout the night sometimes and have trouble falling back asleep) is why my mental health disorders seem to be treatment-resistant. I never realized how important sleep is to mental health. 

I also experience daytime fatigueness but I literally realized this week that drinking green tea would help. I only thought to start drinking it because it helps with anxiety and will also me energy since it has caffeine. It's ideal for me because the anti-anxiety effect allows me to get energy without that caffeine jittery effect and the likes.

bipolar,Alternate state of mind anxiety attack? ,"For many years now  I’ll have these “episodes” where it’s like my mind is in a different state. I call it dissociation  but it’s also like an anxiety attack  but it can last a very long time (a whole night  a whole day). It’s like I’m completely disoriented  out of it  shut down  shut off and cannot stop worrying but also nothing makes sense  I can’t remember anything  I can’t think straight. I don’t want to be around anyone and don’t feel comfortable around anyone  including my partner. It’s not just anxiety…. It’s like a completely different state of being where I’m in an emergency amount of distress and confusion. Trying to explain it to professionals let alone people in my life is so hard  even impossible. I live in fear of it happening at the wrong times. I wanted to ask if other bipolar people experience something like this

bipolar,Any anxiety attacks you look back and laugh?,"Currently just solved another near-death experience (or so I thought). Today  after the shower  my body ran hot and I started sweating. Me  a 28 (M) who’s healthy  naturally thought I was stroking out. My heat was on by accident  and I live in LA.

Other times are:
The time I went to the ER for a collapsed lung. I was “breathing too well” and convinced myself I must have a hole in my lung . Turns out that’s not how it works I was perfectly healthy  just had an anxiety attack. However the doctor who was incredibly understanding in the discharge paper wrote “glad you’re okay  seek medications and therapy”

Another time I was at work and had an extremely sore throat. I convinced myself I had Legionnaires’ disease. The very rare  deathly pneumonia that you get through water. After plenty of tests and panicking my work and the hospital (I went by ambulance from work)  my results were… the flu.

I had a long week at work once and was pounding coffee all week. So when I had a heart palpitation (at 25) I called 911 and was rushed to the hospital. Perfectly fine  just over-caffeinated. The best part of the story? I called back the next night for the same issue  absolutely convinced it was the big one  and the SAME PARAMEDIC came. He convinced me to go home before I made it to the ER this time.

I’ve learned to calm myself down and think of the facts and worst case call someone but at first before I understood anxiety these were actually the scariest things. What are your story’s ",5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1f9coql/any_anxiety_attacks_you_look_back_and_laugh/
bipolar,Anxiety attacks and racing thought,"Hi All  

It;s my first time posting and i am posting because i'm lonely and freak out daily. I don't live in my country of original and am not fluent yet in the one i live in but about 5-6 months ago i had a very strong long during psychosis which got me hospitalized for 5 weeks and diagnosed with bipolar disorder 1  before I was allowed to go home with partner. 

For I while I had strong panic attacks because of situations from the hospital but I was mainly strongly determined to not fall into a depression and I could feel joy of being out of 'jail'. Joy to be at home. 

  
The last few weeks however I have felt myself slipping down a dark stream of thoughts I do not feel in control to stop them. My shirk gave me anxiety tablets  they calm my body but not my brain. 

  
I'm scared to write this but I have to reach out to people who hopefully understand and can help me with tips on how to gain control while not losing my job.

how do you cope through the moments when you’ve completely lost control? how do you keep from hurting yourself? 

i actually just concluded a severe depressive episode as im writing this and i need help  i journal during really extreme moments but its not helping  i lose control over my mind and my body and yesterday i almost got put inpatient (im seriously surprised i didnt) because i slammed my head into the concrete and got a huge lump and i was completely erratic. everytime i have one of these episodes i hear so many people that i know telling me terrible things and i end up chanting it to myself aloud and becoming so overwhelmed i hit myself in the head or scratch or slap or do anything i can to make myself stop  but nothing stops. and in these moments my therapist advised me if i can to journal and so i have been trying but ill still lose control and throw the notebook or stab it or hit my hands on it (which is still better than myself). 

i really don’t want to be this way it eats me alive and it effects all of my relationships and im just so scared  i can feel myself coming more undone. i cant reason with myself or tell myself things aren’t real or happening until way after the fact and it scares me. i’m unmedicated but i am seeking treatment  and im waiting for a call back right now but i know it will take time for me to even settle down into my meds and i really can’t keep living like this. i try so hard to keep a routine and do simple tasks like hygiene and cleaning and laundry to keep myself busy but nothing is distracting enough. i just lost my job and im pretty sure it’s because i had moments like this at work i can’t keep it together at all anymore and i was wondering if any of you would have advice ",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1hw2sx7/tw_how_do_you_cope_with_panic_attacksself_harm/

Another big one is that people think the depression is just feeling down. For me  it’s feeling completely empty  like I can’t even get out of bed. The manic phase isn’t just about being hyper either — for me  it’s racing thoughts  risky behavior  and sometimes feeling out of control.

For all this depressive period  I have been trying to do stuff  I am suposed to enjoy in my free times  like watching movies  playing videogames  drawing  or watching videos on youtube. But I can't seem to enjoy them. There's this feeling of emptiness and guilt that I don't know where could it be coming from.

I don't know why is this happening. I really want to do stuff that is fun to distract myself  specially play videogames which I was enjoying a lot before my depressive phase started. But whenever I think about playing videogames  or drawing  I can't help but feel empty and guilty.

It's also true that  during my manic phase  I decided to do a lot of stuff this year: Get my driving license during january  adopt two cats (also during january)  and start playing a series of videogames in chronological order (which kind of feels like homework instead of free time...).

I was mostly depressed and nothing made me feel like life was worth living.  I got into psychedelics in my early twenties and had what I deemed spiritual experiences.   I found purpose and meaning through all the pain.  Developed beliefs about what the world and my place around that. 

Years later I was hospitalized for a manic episode.  It felt like a spiritual experience at the time but time had bore out that I was out of my mind.  There were things that happened that make me still feel like it was a spiritual experience and plenty of others that don’t.  I am lost again  unable to accept anything as reality because I’ve been wrong over and over.  I don’t see how a therapist could work that out for me with the extreme doubt in the way.

bipolar,After 5 years of having somewhat stable moods  bipolar is knocking me down again real hard fo the point that I want to end my life,"Just a bit background about me: 
I had a good childhood. I grew up in a middle class family and attended one of the best colleges in the US.

I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder (type 2) since 2012. It seems like mental disorder runs in my family. It took me 3 years to understand what bipolar is and how to start living with it. I took time off from work to get MBA degree where I could take my time away from work. After MBA  I’ve got one of the best jobs I could have asked for in one of the top tech companies. 

In 2018  I have decided to join my uncle business and things turned for the worst. In the 2 years of working  I have to cope with verbal abuse and I was treated as a kid who couldn’t do anything. My stress started to accumulated while I work about 16-18 hours a day and I also work on Saturday and Sunday as well. I have to take Zolpidem so I could go to bed. Though  I like to take Zolpidem just to feel numb and hallucinated so I could escape from reality. 

After 2 years of repetitive verbal abuse  it triggered me to start feeling depressed again. After 2 years and a loss of a family member  I finally broke down. 

I had a crippling depressive episode where I could not do anything beside I wanted so sleep all day. I lost the will to live I started to look out of the window and imagining myself jumping out of the window so all the pain could end. 

I feel so ashamed of myself for feeling this way again. As a person who went to good schools and hard great job  I feel so weak and worthless. I am so ashamed that good schools and good job couldn’t help me become “strong” and “stable “. I feel that my parent investment in me is futile and I am ashamed of being a bad and useless son. 

After the event  I decided to quit. After quitting  I went through so many episodes of up and down (mostly down). To be honest  I also lost my confidence  dream  hope  passion  and life...

I don’t know how to pick those pieces up and assemble them back yet. I am very lost. 

Now  I’m back helping my dad’s business  but my bipolar disorder are more intense than before. Someday  I couldn’t even work. Some small triggers could put me in depression mode. 

Why am I so weak? Why am I so useless? 

Yesterday and today. My suicidal thoughts came again. I look at the same windows where I wanted to jump out and end everything. 

How can I get back to my 5 years spree where I could live normally with bipolar. 

I want to be normal. I want to be a strong husband for my wife. I want to be an older brother to take care of my two younger brothers. Lastly  I want to help lessen my parents work in our family business. But being me like this  I don’t think I can’t do anything and I feel so guilty. I feel like I am not deserved to live. 

I am writing this post on Zolpidem so it could numb my feeling.

I cannot walk  I sit down and I remain in that places for hours because I am not able to get up  mentally and physically  and very  very constant pain in thighs  poking my thighs would even bring pain. I even wished I could sit in wheelchair  this would make my life so much easier  becuase my legs geniunely cannot move... But I know I am just bipolar  and people would judge.

It took me 2 months to stop having those feelings  but they still pop up some time to time and I just feel sometimes disassociated from my legs when I sit down...

EDIT: Thanks again for all of the advice. I know that my husband just doesn’t understand and needs to educate himself more on this illness. A little backstory on me- I grew up with a bipolar-schizoaffective mother who really was out of control. No stability. Ever. She ended up killing herself when I was 16. I was first medicated and diagnosed at 13 and always felt my mother almost pushed me into a diagnosis. I was medicated until she died. Then not again until 2019 at 25 years old in the midst of a terribly toxic relationship. This man lied to me about everything  forced me to go get medicated only to use it against me and gaslight me into thinking I was crazy. I found a good med combo and met my husband in 2020. I was still emotionally shattered from previous relationship. But my husband stuck by me. When I say he pushed me- I don’t mean he made me or asked me. He did make comments and suggestions. I think he is just afraid the meds are going to damage me more in other ways  idk. Since being off meds I’ve held down a great job  but I’ve never had an issue working anyways. I think because I’m not like my mother was  to the same extent  I think I can do it without the meds. But lately I feel like I can’t. My work is suffering now bc I can’t focus. My relationship is suffering because I can’t open up and be vulnerable anymore. Just feels like a spiral and I don’t like that. I’ve always prided myself for my resilience but it’s come with a lot of suffering  self hatred and pain. So yeah. 

Thank you all again.

————-
When my husband and I first got together I was medicated and mostly stable. He is very natural and pushed me to try life without meds  so I did. And for the most part- I’m doing okay but I struggle occasionally. Especially lately due to family issues and work. I am the agitated type when manic and everything annoys me. I’m also very sensitive so any criticism really pushes me. Anyways- I have a had a few drinks and when I drink all my stifled emotions bubble to the surface. And my husband is a very logical  type a person. He doesn’t get it and I don’t know that he really wants to. I have really suppressed a huge part of who I am in order to stay “normal” but I feel like I can’t do it much longer. How can I let my guard down with my husband and let him know who I really am deep down? I know he loves me but we are two totally different ppl who have lived very different lives. I feel like a big part of me is missing since I’ve been holding all of my darkness in… I’m ok with my darkness and I need to feel those things but it’s been so long that I forgot how to deal with it. I kind of have been considering getting back on meds  but I’m afraid to tell him. Please give me any advice you may have. Thank you.",223,179,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11v7gu0/unmedicated_going_on_a_year_now_recently_married/
bipolar,I Want Your Help So bad I Want Someone to understand I want the pain to stop.,"I made a Reddit account just for this forum alone. I stumbled upon this subreddit while googling for support groups. Reading all of these posts makes me feel like I have found an entire world of people who are just like me. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by a shrink almost 2 years ago to date. I was never able to fully let myself open up and felt awkward in his presence  shortly after diagnoses and talk of medication I pleaded with my less than attentive parents that I was fine and I may have made a mistake by asking for help. I stopped going to him and have been on my own ever since. I'm 19 now. Life has been rough to say the least. I have had 7 different jobs with long periods of unemployment. I throw money away without any regret. I did terrible in school  losing interest and procrastinating my grades away. 

My personality consists of absolute narcissism coupled with crippling self doubt. Random bouts of hyperactivity that go along with reckless spending and embarrassing behavior plus a sex drive that gets pushed on my girlfriend making her feel like an object for sex rather than someone I love. However the worst aspect of my personality has to be the depression and the past few months it is the strongest it has ever been in my life. For the first time i've been trying to reach out to others about my sadness. The pain cuts so deep some nights  Ive tried everything  Suicide chat  The hotline  coming out to friends. I cant make it work. I cant get them to understand. I feel like when I try to explain how I feel it comes out as cheesy and melodramatic. I desperately need someone close to me to understand what I feel. I want help again. I want medication. I want anything that will make this literal day to day suffering stop or I just might end up dead.   ",4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/877wd7/i_want_your_help_so_bad_i_want_someone_to/
bipolar,Getting to the point where I just want to anything to stop the pain,I’m 21 and in college  all my life I’ve felt like a total outsider. I never fit in anywhere and was bullied in school. All my life my self esteem has been in the gutter and being bipolar it doesn’t help the situation. Every day I wake up feeling like a total loser and just look forward to sleeping again. I have friends but I never really feel like they also like me. Same when it comes to women  I’ll date here and there but it always ends in two ways. I either don’t have strong feelings for her or I really like her and she doesn’t feel the same way. I always feel so sad and frustrated. Why can’t I just be normal like everyone else? I look at my little brother and he’s having the childhood I always wanted. It hurts me every day which sucks because I love him and see him almost every day. At this point I just want to end it  Just the idea of hanging my self brings me some relief. I just want the pain to end and this seems like the best option for me. Why suffer fore another 60+ years to just die alone and old in some nursing home.

bipolar,Anyone resentful they were born?,"So my origin story frustrates me to no end.

My mom had to do fertility treatments for a while before she got pregnant the first time. Unfortunately after giving birth he died. A year later she did the treatments again and ended up giving birth to my sister. Then she planned on divorcing my dad… but surprise! She found out she was pregnant with me… no fertility treatments. She considered abortion but ended up keeping me. After I was born she got so depressed she wouldn’t hold me. She ended up planning to kill me but doctors intervened and put her on meds and she did not end up killing me. Years later she gave birth again with the help of fertility treatments with her new husband…

I keep asking myself why I am even alive. Like what was the purpose? I wasn’t supposed to be around. My barely fertile mom somehow had a surprise child and considered getting rid of me twice… like I don’t think I should be around.

I’m pretty resentful that all of this pain and frustration could have been nipped in the bud. I don’t want to hurt myself but I do kind of wish I wasn’t born. 

Does anyone else feel this way? ",96,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1jghm5u/anyone_resentful_they_were_born/
bipolar,Getting a new psych - wtf did she just say??,"I am hypomanic bipolar  and have been on my stabilizing medication since 2021. My psych has always been on the odder side  but then she went MIA for multiple weeks on end  didn’t reply to my request for refills  etc. I should have switched to a new doc then and there. But I didn’t because finding a new provider is always such a pain in the ass. 

Today though  she pushed me over the line. 

I’m 15 weeks pregnant  and my OB recommended that I talk to my psych about a blood test to check my med levels because pregnancy can make the med less potent  and my OB wanted to make sure that the pregnancy wasn’t fucking with my levels. 

I mention this to my psych and after responding with surprise to the info that pregnancy can lower the levels  she says  “Your OB doesn’t know what she’s talking about. There is no blood test for that medicine.” Well  a simple google search says otherwise. It’s alarming that she doesn’t know this and got defensive  though knowing her I wasn’t surprised that she got defensive. 

But then  she said: “actually  sometimes I have pregnant people stop medications entirely. You’ve got happy pregnancy hormones protecting you  swimming around  so without medication  it’s ok. I worked with this one patient who went off powerful mood stabilizers during her pregnancy and it was the most wonderful time for her.” What…the…fuck???

That is a TERRIFYING recommendation. I don’t trust her at all. I’m out. ",94,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1fo3r9f/getting_a_new_psych_wtf_did_she_just_say/
bipolar,Open letter - what it is like to be bipolar...,"I am going to break this up into 2 different sections so I can write a book while following the rules of the group.

TLDR: I am describing what it is like to suffer from this nasty  debilitating disease and how it impacts me and many others.

*Someone once asked me what it is like to suffer from bipolar disorder.  I couldn’t answer them because it is such a complex subject.  The fact of the matter is that bipolar disorder is something someone that suffers from wishes they could forget about or does not want to look back upon the destruction that it has caused for them and others.  Some are able to do so but many if not most do not.   It is such a painful subject to them.*

*I now have found several metaphors that describe what it is like to suffer from this disease.  INXS in the mid-80s had a song called “Devil Inside”.  Yep  that is a perfect name for this thing called bipolar disorder.  The story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is another.  Visualizing a seal balancing a ball on its nose with a glass of nitroglycerine on top of the ball is another; one little move and the entire world can end.  All of these things allow you to visualize what it is like to suffer from this possible soul crushing medical disorder.*

*Not all of us with bipolar disorder have had destructive episodes but those episodes are just a step away for any of us.  We have been prescribed medication to help keep us from having an episode or to help us stay away from having one in the future.  Many of us take those medications  others think they don’t have a problem and do not take them  or we self-medicate.  Self-medicating as in doing other drugs  drinking  or both.  The issue is that sometimes these treatments are not enough to stop things from happening again.  There is often a straw that breaks the camel’s back when it comes to having an episode.  You have to realize that is the case.  We can be medicated to the point where we are zombies and that still might not stop an episode from occurring.  You just need to remember that what you are seeing often isn’t the real person inside.*

*The best thing that someone that doesn’t have bipolar disorder but have experienced someone that has is that they are empathetic.  You need to know that the friend  loved one  colleague  or whomever isn’t the person that displayed some type of insanity isn’t what you saw.  Sure  it was destructive to a relationship and might have been a coup de grace to it but it wasn’t the real person on the other end of this experience.  Further  you cannot treat them with like they are made of glass either.  It is a balancing act that is often difficult to find the fulcrum.  Worst case for you is to talk to the sufferer.  Ask them if they feel that you are being too hard or too soft to them.*",83,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1ef7osw/open_letter_what_it_is_like_to_be_bipolar/
bipolar,Everything is NOT going to be okay,"I'm tired of people telling me that it's going to be okay. People keep saying it's just a bad week  a bad month  or a bad period  and that everything will eventually be fine. But I don’t believe it anymore. Keeping hope? Been there  done that—it didn’t work.

I understand that some people need to hear those words because it helps them  but for me  I’m done with motivational speeches or empty reassurances.

2024 hasn’t just been a bad period—it’s been the worst year of my life. I’m only 22 yo  but I still believe the worst is yet to come. I’ve been struggling since my teenage years  and the past two years have been even worse—a series of endless bad luck. At first  I had hope  but things just kept getting worse. I’ve lost my faith  my hope  my goals  and even my reason to live.
Every single aspect of my life feels broken. Whether it’s my professional life  school  love life  friendships  or family  something is always hurting me.

Now  I can barely get out of bed in the morning. I barely talk to anyone because no one truly understands how bad it is. I feel numb every day. I hate hearing  “You’ll be okay. Just keep fighting  just keep hoping; in the end  everything will be fine.”
How do you know it’s going to be okay? Some people succeed  and others fail—that’s life. So what makes you so sure I’ll be one of the lucky ones? Maybe I’m just meant to suffer. That’s how it feels. 

After 22 years  I still don’t know what happiness feels like. I’ve never known how it feels to love and be loved back  to have peace of mind  or to just be okay.

So yeah  I’ve lost hope. The only reason I’m still alive is that I don’t want my family to mourn my death—it would crush them. Unless you can truly assure me that things will get better  don’t say it. Just tell me you understand or try to ease my pain  but don’t tell me everything will be okay. Because if I believe you and things get worse  I’ll blame you for lying to me. You gave me hope when there was none.

bipolar,Do you have family members with bipolar?,"I come from a family who has no interest in mental healthcare.

They don’t have understanding or interest in the topic. They mostly just see any issues as burnout. This of course means nobody has ever had or been helped with anything that they might need. 

I definitely suspect both my parents have some form of undiagnosed illness. Not necessarily bipolar.

The first person I remember meeting with bipolar was my dad’s second wife.

She scared me as a child because of how others would react and comment on her “erratic behaviour”. Only once I came to terms with my own bipolar I started to appreciate what she went through.

I wanted to know if any of you had a parent or a family member with similar or the same diagnosis. Are you close or is it just endless misunderstanding? ",89,154,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1je7lyc/do_you_have_family_members_with_bipolar/

bipolar,Persuade me Mania isn’t worth it,"Soooo  I’ve hard a really rough time since October and was in the hospital in december due to being psychotic manic (BP 1).

bipolar,Why is everybody not angry?,"Not just angry  but like livid. 

We are constantly having our emotions pushed aside and our opinions  experiences or feelings invalidated. When we finally explode  we're looked at like we're crazy  or like we're winding ourselves up and it could have been avoided.

Well maybe it could have been avoided  but I can tell you right now  without actually making allowances for us  or actually showing up when you say you will  throwing medication down my throat to stop me from 'winding myself up' only pacifies me temporarily. It doesn't take away how I feel. The anger  the disappointment  the hurt  the injustice... It's all there  just bubbling under the surface  waiting to be let out.

I just want someone who will listen  not somebody who will start immedietly trying to calm me down because i'm too 'wound up' for them. Being heard goes along way  but it seems like nobody wants to actually listen to me when I'm in a state  when I'm actually my most vulnerable.

And so  I find myself yet again  turned away from comfort. Turned away from love  and away from understanding. I'm starting to think that nobody can truly understand you  not even yourself.

bipolar,I had a manic episode and almost got pregnant on purpose ,"I just need to get this off my chest because I feel like nobody is listening to me.

The title says it all basically. I had an event happen that triggered an episode back in the beginning of August. I didn't realize until last week. In that time  I was absolutely obsessed with having a baby out of nowhere. I told my fiance  who was elated and told everyone he knew. I told all my siblings  my friends  random people who came into my bar  and my grandma. I immediately quit smoking  got my birth control (iud) removed within 5 days  and started taking prenatal vitamins. I was obsessively checking for the exact moment I ovulated so I knew exactly when I'd get pregnant. It was my only focus and drive and thought. 

I scheduled a meeting with my psychiatrist to get off my meds asap. We decided to taper throughout the month on just my mood stabilizers and see what happens. I was frustrated because I wanted to be fully unmedicated as fast as I could. I wanted to get pregnant now  and any chemicals would harm the baby. 

Once I got halfway through my dosage  I crashed. I spent a week on the couch sleeping. I called out of work because I just didn't have the energy to go. It took about that long to realize I was depressed. 

I also realized I didn't want to have a baby anymore. I usually start manic and end depressive and so that's when things started clicking for me. That's why everything was so rushed and so right now.

 I'm so embarrassed by the whole thing. People ask me about it and I just lie. I have totally dropped the whole thing in conversation otherwise. I had to talk to my fiance about it and he was understanding. We agreed that we can revisit it at the end of the year.

I met with my psych at our follow up and decided to up my dosage again. I don't want to get pregnant. Which sucks because I got my birth control removed. So now it's a very real possibility. I'm terrified to find out if I am pregnant this month in the midst of all this.

All my life I've struggled with my mental. I've had many outbursts of all sorts  really embarrassing and destructive. I know I'm bipolar  I've been diagnosed professionally. My mom has always thrown it in my face  made me seem like a monster  or a freak. And I felt like a monster and a freak for many years. She has always acted like there was something wrong with me because it  like it was something I could control  not like a disease that I was born with. For so long I was ashamed of it so I refused to take medication that would help. Now I'm an adult  and it's really affecting me. It's affecting my relationships  my job  my life. I'm always so up and down and doing things on impulse like spending money that I don't have. I lost my girlfriend of two years because of it (I don't blame her). 

  
It's affected my life so much to the point that I want to do something about it. I can't keep living like this  and I'm old enough to understand now that I can't help it  that I'm not a freak  but deep down there will always be my mom saying stuff like ""they would never let someone like you be a police officer or be in the military"" and ""nobody in their right mind will ever let you hold a gun"".

bipolar,I feel like a burden to my loved ones,I’m (34F) just coming out of a manic episode and a very normal sentence by my sister triggered a crash. Now I just don’t feel like talking. Both my partner and my sister are here and I feel like both of them are fed up with me. I feel uber guilty. How do I deal with this crash? How do I not be so miserable and such a horrible person to be around? ,9,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1bn8o0c/i_feel_like_a_burden_to_my_loved_ones/
bipolar,Feeling like a Burden/ Not being able to Receive Positivity / Fear of Success,"There is so much love and support coming into my life right now that I feel like I can't let in. Almost like my emotions don't believe it. And it is holding back my friendships and professional relationships. I am very mistrusting that people *actually like me* and don't just think I'm crazy and overwhelming. I feel suspicious. 

When I open up to people  it's terrifying  and even when I feel I've take up too much of peoples' time  it's terrifying. If I have to write a longer email  I'm terrified people are rolling their eyes  exhausted with me. And I go into a cold sweat after sending emails. When people ask me questions about my life and preferences  I feel like they think I'm unhinged if I go on for more than a few sentences. 

Because of my mania/hypomania times  I feel like I didn't have control over this sort of thing. And I think that I'm always worried people will listen to me speak or be expansive in an email and be like ""YOU'RE OVERWHELMING YOU MUST BE UNWELL"" and fire me or admonish me or reject me. But time and time again they're not rejecting me  they're accepting me. Actually a lot of people are super enthusiastic about how expansive and thorough I am  how passionate I can be  etc. I have tons of evidence that I'm not bothering or burdening anyone but I can't seem to get past my cold sweats and fears after a work meeting or email I have to send.

Does anyone go through this? How long does it take to trust that I'm not always manic/scary/hypomanic just because I'm loquacious and good at my job (which involves NEEDING to communicate extensively). I think sometimes being hypomanic in my life has led to career successes because of my ability to think fast  write quickly and jump my mind around. And I love that part of myself  so do others. I haven't had a full mania in almost 10 years  my meds work  I'm in a happy marriage where I am actually usually able to receive and trust love.  I think I'm really scared because I'm getting more successful with my work and I'm terrified that I'll achieve some goals and then crash and burn or I'll be in environments where I have responsibility and I'll spin out and be unhinged and get fired. I can't tell the difference between ""being aware of manic signs and taking care of myself"" and ""being obsessed with monitoring myself"".",6,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1cbb5wt/feeling_like_a_burden_not_being_able_to_receive/
bipolar,I feel like such a piece of shit. ,"Everybody keeps telling me I’ve made so much progress since my diagnosis and inpatient stay 3 years ago. Technically they are right but on my bad days it doesn’t feel like it. 

Currently on lithium and Latuda. It’s working for the most part. Just been having a rough time the past two days. Didn’t go to work today. Scared I’m going to get fired from another job due to my lack of attendance. I just feel like such a failure and a waste of life and a lazy piece of shit. I need to stop smoking weed but it’s so difficult. I feel like everything would be better if I was dead. I feel like a burden on everyone I know. I can barely take care of myself. Just feel like total shit. Most of the time I feel pretty okay generally. Just feeling rough today. ",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1c1rrqa/i_feel_like_such_a_piece_of_shit/
bipolar,I am starting to feel like I am drowning without meds  but I'm in a huge dilemma about them. Has anyone overcome concerns like I have?,"I have been diagnosed with an eating disorder and borderline personality disorder  but my current therapist thinks (and I also think) that I also have bipolar and OCD alongside.   


...BUT my OCD doesn't ""let"" me take pills like Lamotrigine because of the rare but possibly deadly side effects. (this is no mild concern  I am literally scared to death to take it  I am convinced I will die). Also  my eating diorder doesn't let me take anything that might cause weight gain (and I have already developed insulin resistance due to 6 years of anorexia and 2 years of binge eating  so it is difficult to manage my weight in a healthy way as it is - currently I am at a healthy BMI and I am hoping to stay in this range).  


But I feel like it is starting to get to the point where I am just so so angry that I am not living up to my potential due to these illnesses  cannot take challenges I would like to because I cannot bear the emotional burden and lack the confidence to do so. Even though I have been in therapy for 10 years.

  
Also  depressive episodes are crippling and the whole thing is rapid cycling  it is making me exhausted mentally and physically.  
And not only that  but during depressive episodes I get so low  and also my BPD steps in with crippling emotional pain that actually feels so deep I can feel it physically in my forehead  and it is really really crippling.  


Can anyone relate even if just to some parts of this? Has anyone come over dilemmas like this? Please give me some hope if you can. This is h.e.l.l.",4,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/14748d0/i_am_starting_to_feel_like_i_am_drowning_without/
bipolar,I feel like a burden on my partner,I’m going through pretty bad depression and I’ve just not been okay. I feel like the crying and sadness has put a burden on my partner and I feel like I need so much reassurance that he’s not sick of me. I feel so mad at myself that I’m this way.

bipolar,Do I feel worthless because I am experiencing bi polar depression?,Simple question. I feel like when I’m in a low I just think this is my identity and that I genuinely am worthless….but maybe it’s just my condition telling me that?

bipolar,I’ve been feeling worthless. I have all the energy though 😮‍💨…,I’ve had racing thoughts lately and have been desperately waiting for my next appointment. I am trying to reduce my meds because they’re making me feel less conscious. I think I’m just gonna lie about my symptoms and ask for a tapering on my sleeping meds. I only needed them to improve my sleep but they’re only making my brain fog worse.,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1d98ww7/ive_been_feeling_worthless_i_have_all_the_energy/

bipolar,Feeling worthless,I don’t know if this is another episode starting  but does anyone else feel a sense of worthlessness or self-loathing living with this illness? I feel like I’ve squandered my potential and am going to be stuck in poverty working a dead end job forever.

bipolar,feeling worthless,"It’s my third time dropping out of college and i’m feeling hopeless right now. My dream career is becoming a doctor and i don’t think i can do it  not because i don’t have the grades  i do have them  i mean i’m not failing or anything it’s just each time when the end of the semester is coming the pressure is too much for me and i become physically exhausted and i just cannot do it anymore. 

The worst thing is my family  i know i’ve been disappointed them and they think i should just do something else because it’ll always be the same. 

I also am heavily medicated  i take 650mg of seroquel each night and a bunch of other pills for sleeping and migraines. I’m BP2  ADHD  i have all sort of anxiety disorder  panic disorder  the list is long but mainly it’s that.

I tried to tell my family that maybe i should take some time off and focus on myself  maybe try other pills because these doesn’t seems to be working for me as i’m always in the ""fog"" and tired. For them  taking ""time off"" is not possible  i cannot just live life be better and after do what i want to do and i think that maybe it’s partially why i’ve been dropping out because i’m just drained from this tiredness that’s been prolonged.

So right now  i don’t now whether i should do another shitty semester or really take time for me  but i feel like i’ll be losing time in a sense? I really want to become a doctor  but maybe this just isn’t for me i really need advice and your thoughts.

bipolar,How do you deal with feeling worthless?,"I had a very serious mental breakdown 2 years ago after I was prescribed lexapro and every since my life has just spiraled  I can’t find work  car died  and I’ve just been stuck in the same place ever since.

It probably doesn’t help that I have multiple neurodivergentcies (ADHD  autism) so focusing on tasks and getting overwhelmed and completely shutting down are things that happen regularly.

I feel worthless constantly. I used to just white knuckle my way through life but the older I get the more impossible it feels to do that  even getting out of bed makes me feel like I’m burning out. I’m on a mood stabilizer and Wellbutrin  but only really get anything done when I have some break through mania and that usually ends in some questionable/dangerous/self destructive behavior. I desperately need advice I don’t know what to do and I know hating myself isn’t productive but it’s hard not to when you struggle to do even the simplest things. I don’t know how I went from graduation in the top 10% of my class to not even being able to hold a job and I’m feeling desperate.",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1aig6sc/how_do_you_deal_with_feeling_worthless/
bipolar,Sometimes I feel so lonely and worthless I don't want to be around anymore,"Weekends are the worst because I have no one to hang out with and I have nowhere to go. The idea of being invited anywhere is completely lost on me. I try to find people on dating and hookup apps but I'm ignored by almost everyone or rejected. The off chance I do meet up with someone  they never want to see me again. The few people I do make friends with are out of my life within a few days or weeks. I literally have no one on my phone contacts besides my roommate and my boss. 

I feel so lonely it's so debilitating. I'm a 30 year old man! It's been this way my whole life. I just want a friend I can connect with or a lover who makes me feel like life is worth all this. 

I'm so alone. I just don't know how I can keep going on line this. I thought in my early and mid 20s I would have killed myself before I'm 30. Now here I am  feeling worse about myself than I ever have. My social life is work and the gym. I'm probably approaching the end. I kind of want to quietly just go away. 

I cried so hard after I got off work tonight. I have to pull over and n parking lots and just ball. This happens a lot. I have no one to share how I feel with.",37,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/13h0zwh/sometimes_i_feel_so_lonely_and_worthless_i_dont/
bipolar,SSDI / SSI and feelings of worthlessness,"Is anyone else here on or applying for SSI / SSDI? If so  have you also struggled with feelings of worthlessness  aimlessness  and guilt? Have you found any resources (books  videos  types of therapy  etc) that are helpful with coping with the loss of pride that goes with no longer working?

I’ve applied for SSDI. I know my condition is bad enough to warrant the decision to apply  but I still feel horrible about it.

bipolar,I got fired today.,"I got fired from a job that love for underperforming. This job paid me well  I got to travel but most importantly  it helped me take care of my daughter by myself (I'm a single parent). 
I've ever been so afraid of what the future holds and honestly I feel so much shame from this. 
I was diagnose with bipolar 2 years ago and I'm still not sure how to effectively manage it in terms of work. My gran  whom I was very close to  passed away on Christmas day and I think that didn't help with how I was already feeling.

bipolar,Who else feels worthless and like a burden to society,I don’t even have to say ‘does anybody else’ because I know others here do too. It helps to know I’m not alone.
